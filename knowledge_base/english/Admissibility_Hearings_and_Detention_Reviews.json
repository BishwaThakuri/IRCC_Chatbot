The structure of the \nmanual is now divided into three main components:  \n sections 1-9 - information applicable to both admissibility hearings and detention \nreviews);  \n sections 10-13 - information specific to admissibility hearings and;  \n section 14 - information specific to detention reviews.  \nThe section pertaining to procedures applicable to detention reviews was also significantly \nexpanded and updated to include, amongst other things, additional alternatives to detention. \nAlso, as IRCC has transitioned most ENF manuals to a PDF format, broken web links were \nrepaired throughout the manual. A reference to the new ENF34 manual was added. \n \n2015-04-29 \nSubstantive revisions were made to improve the flow of the manual and to reflect current \nlegislation and procedures throughout this manual chapter, including the following: \n \nA new subsection 9.5 was added to clarify procedures related to persons concerned who \nare referred by a Port of Entry for an admissibility hearing.  \n \nAdded the numbers of the listed forms and a column titled “Purpose” to clearly define the \npurpose for each form. The same amendments (form titles and numbers) were applied \nthroughout the manual. \n \nSection 6 was amended to clarify background information on the nature of proceedings \nbefore the Immigration Division. \n \nSections 8, 9, 10 and 11 were amended to streamline the language and to clarify \nprocedures related to admissibility hearings. \n \nSection 12 was updated to reflect 2008 changes to the Immigration and Refugee \nProtection Act regarding procedures related to applications for non-disclosure of \ninformation. \n \nSection 13 was updated to streamline and clarify procedures related to Detention \nReviews. \n \nUpdated section 14 to clarify instructions and procedures related to admissibility hearings \nand detention reviews. \n \nSection 15 was added to include procedures for paper based hearings for section \nA36(1)(a).\n2022-03-03 \n \n6 \n2006-02-16 \nENF 3 – Section 13.3, an explanatory paragraph was added as well as a link to IP 10, section 9. \n2005-11-29 \nENF 3 - Minor amendments were made to reflect the split between Citizenship and Immigration \nCanada (CIC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Clarification was provided as to \nwhom the hearings officer represents at an admissibility hearing and/or detention review before \nthe Immigration Division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB). \n2003-09-04  \nMinor changes/clarifications were made to chapter ENF 3.\n2022-03-03 \n \n7 \n1 What this chapter is about  \nThis chapter provides functional direction and guidance to hearings officers when acting as \nrepresentative for the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP) or the \nMinister of Immigration Refugees and Citizenship at admissibility hearings and detention \nreviews before the Immigration Division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB). \nThis chapter highlights various provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection \nAct (IRPA) and Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) that may apply, to \nhearings officers when preparing and presenting these types of cases before the ID. \nIt also provides assistance to hearings officers by identifying procedural and evidentiary \nrequirements.  \nNote: References to IRPA appear in the text with an \"A\" prefix followed by the section number. \nReferences to the IRPR appear with a \"R\" prefix followed by the section number. \n2 Program objectives  \nWhile all the objectives of the IRPA are important to keep in mind, the key objectives that relate \ndirectly to admissibility hearings and detention reviews are: \n To protect public health and safety (the health and safety of Canadians) and to maintain \nthe security of Canadian society (A3(1)(h) & A3(2)(g)); \n To promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights and \nby denying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals or security risks \n(A3(1)(i)); and \n To promote international justice and security by denying access to Canadian territory to \npersons, including refugee claimants, who are security risks or serious criminals \n(A3(2)(h)).  \n To maintain, through the establishment of fair and efficient procedures, the integrity of   \nthe Canadian immigration system; (A3(1)(f.1)) \n \n \nWhile there are other application considerations set out in the IRPA, the key considerations that \nrelate directly to admissibility hearings and detention reviews are that the IRPA be construed and \napplied in a manner that: \n Furthers the domestic and international interests of Canada (A3(3)(a)); \n Ensures that decisions taken under the IRPA are consistent with the Canadian Charter of \nRights and Freedoms(A3(3)(d)); and \n Complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory \n(A3(3)(f)).\n2022-03-03 \n \n8 \n \n3 The Act and Regulations  \n3.1 IRPA objectives and application \n \nFor information about \n \nRefer to this section of the Act \nThe objectives with respect to immigration  \nA3(1)  \nThe objectives with respect to refugees  \nA3(2)  \nHow the Act is to be construed and applied  \nA3(3)  \n \n3.2 Inadmissibility \nPart I, Division 4 of IRPA contains the provisions that establish inadmissibility. \nCategories of inadmissibility \nFor information about \nRefer to this section of the Act \nSecurity grounds  \nA34 \nHuman or international rights violations  \nA35 \nSerious criminality \nA36(1) & 36(3) \nCriminality  \nA36(2) & 36(3) \nOrganized criminality  \nA37 \nHealth grounds  \nA38 \nFinancial reasons  \nA39 \nMisrepresentation  \nA40 \nCessation of refugee protection \nA40.1 \nNon-compliance with Act  \nA41 \nInadmissible family member  \nA42 \nThe following table outlines provisions which may be useful in making determinations. \nFor more information about \nRefer to \nForeign national  \nA2(1) \nPermanent resident  \nA2(1) \nExamination  \nA18\n2022-03-03 \n \n9 \nTemporary resident  \nA22(1) & (2), A29 \nStatus document \nA31 \nRight to appeal  \nA63 A64 &A65 \nFamily member  \nR1(3) \nCanadian citizen  \nR2 \n \n3.3 Report of inadmissibility and referral to the ID for an admissibility hearing \n \nPart I, Division 5 of IRPA authorizes an officer to prepare an inadmissibility report [A44(1)] and, \nthe referral of such a report by the Minister's Delegate (MD) to the ID for an admissibility \nhearing [44(2)]. \n \nFor more information about \nPlease refer to chapter  \nInadmissibility grounds  \nENF 1, Inadmissibility \nHow an officer decides if an applicant is inadmissible \nto Canada  \nENF 2, Evaluating inadmissibility \nReports on inadmissibility  \nENF 5, Writing Section A44(1) Reports \nMinister's Delegate decisions and administrative \nremovals  \nENF 6, Review of Reports under \nA44(1) \nLoss of permanent resident status \nENF23, Loss of permanent resident \nstatus \nA44(2) and R228 determine the cases in which, after a report under A44(1) has been written, the \nMinister’s delegate has jurisdiction to make a removal order, and in which cases the report may \nbe referred to the ID for an admissibility hearing. \n \n3.4 Detention, alternatives to detention and release \n \nFor more information about \nPlease see \nLegal grounds for arrest and detention of foreign \nnationals or permanent residents  \nA55\n2022-03-03 \n \n10 \nThe release by an officer or by the Immigration \nDivision  \nA56 & A58  \nThe review of detention, conditions of release and the \ndetention of a minor child  \nA57-A60  \nThe factors to be taken into consideration when \nassessing the detention or the release of a person who \nis a danger to the public, whose identity has not been \nestablished, or who is unlikely to appear for \nexamination, an admissibility hearing, removal from \nCanada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the \nmaking of a removal order \nR245-R248 \nFor more information about \nPlease refer to \nThe authority to arrest and detain a person, including \nthe various situations for detention and appropriate \nsections related to detention  \nENF 20, Section 4.1 \nRegulatory factors and conditions  \nENF 20, Section 4.2 \nCBSA policy governing the treatment of persons \ndetained and grounds for detention  \nENF 20, Section 6 \nDeposits and guarantees \nENF8 \nAlternatives to detention \nENF34 \nNote: For more information on arrests, see chapter ENF 7, Investigations and arrests. \n3.5 Decisions by the ID \nA45 identifies the various decisions that the ID may come to at the conclusion of an admissibility \nhearing. \nR229(1) identifies the applicable removal orders made by the ID for the purposes of paragraph \nA45(d).  \nA58 identifies the various decisions that the ID may come to at the conclusion of a detention \nreview. \nFor information about recourse available after the conclusion of an admissibility hearing or \ndetention review, please refer to the references in the following table. \nFor more information about \nPlease refer to this chapter\n2022-03-03 \n \n11 \nJudicial Review \nENF9 \nAppeals before the Immigration Appeal Division of \nthe IRB \nENF19 \n \n3.6 Removal, removal orders, stays and enforcement of removal orders \nPart 1, Division 5 of IRPA refers to loss of loss of status of Citizens, permanent residents and \ntemporary residents.

They must consider the evidence presented at a \nhearing by the hearings officer and by the person concerned or their counsel before making a \ndecision. \n6.2 Administrative tribunal \nThe ID is an administrative tribunal and hearings before the ID are quasi-judicial and adversarial. \nThe principles of natural justice apply to all proceedings before the ID. For further information \non procedural considerations refer to Procedural fairness (ci.gc.ca) \n6.3 Nature of the proceedings before the ID \nThe courts have determined that immigration proceedings are civil, not criminal, in that the \npurpose of the admissibility hearing is not to determine whether the person concerned is guilty or \ninnocent, but rather to determine if  the person is or remains admissible to Canada.\n2022-03-03 \n \n15 \n7 Role of the Hearings Officer  \n7.1 General \nHearings officers represent the position of the Minister in admissibility hearings and detention \nreviews before an ID member. Depending on the alleged inadmissibility, the hearings officer will \nrepresent either the PSEP Minister or the IRCC Minister. At detention reviews, the hearings \nofficer always represents the PSEP Minister.  \nRepresenting the PSEP Minister \nRepresenting the IRCC Minister \n \nSecurity (A34) \n \nViolation of human or international rights (A35) \n \nOrganized crime (A37) \n \n \nAll detention reviews (A57) \n \nCriminality (A36) \n \nHealth reasons (A38)  \n \nFinancial reasons (A39 ) \n \nMisrepresentation (A40) \n \nCessation (A40.1) \n \nNon-compliance with the Act (A41) \n \nInadmissible family member (A42) \n \nIn this capacity, hearings officers: \n \nare firm advocates of the Minister's position at the admissibility hearing and detention \nreviews; \n \nshould always be aware that they are speaking and acting on behalf of the Minister, and \nthat the positions and actions taken should reflect CBSA/IRCC departmental policy; \n \nshould always maintain a respectful and professional decorum in their telephone manner, \nwritten correspondence, conduct at hearings and all interactions with the public; \n \nshould exhibit professionalism by adequately preparing for cases; and \n \nshould treat all parties present at hearings with dignity and respect. This includes ID \nmembers, the persons concerned, counsel, witnesses, interpreters, and observers. \nNote: Hearings officers should communicate with all parties in plain language and refrain from \nusing internal jargon or acronyms (GCMS, PRRA, H&C). \n7.2 Role of the hearings advisor (HA) \nHearings advisors provide support to the hearings officers. They research and interpret \nlegislation and jurisprudence on the grounds for the Minister’s participation and conduct critical \nanalysis of situational information and data to identify possible grounds for the Minister’s \nparticipation and make appropriate recommendations.\n2022-03-03 \n \n16 \nThey prepare cases by investigating and gathering information, such as court information or \nverification of status, through external police agencies, foreign law enforcement agencies, and \nother stakeholders. \nPlease note that the exact duties of hearings advisors may vary by office, subject to operational \nneeds. For up-to-date information on delegated authority for hearings advisors by the PSEP \nMinister and/or the IRCC Minister, please refer to the Immigration Legislation Manual (IL 3). \n7.3 Officer safety and security  \nIf an officer perceives a threat to their safety prior to a hearing, they should immediately inform \ntheir manager and complete the form IRB/CISR 3000 and submit the form to IRB security. \nManagers should contact the IRB and  CBSA regional security to make arrangements for a risk \nassessment and the initiation of appropriate security measures. \nSituations may arise during a hearing in which an officer feels their personal safety or the \nsafety of others is being compromised. When an officer feels their safety has been threatened, \nsuch as in situations of intimidation by witnesses, the uttering of threats or other safety concerns, \nthey should immediately bring the matter to the attention of their manager.  \nIRB procedures for safety and security should help prevent such situations and provide guidance \nfor managing them if they do arise. \n7.4 Incident report writing  \nWhere an incident occurs before, or during, a hearing where an officer feels their safety has been \nthreatened, they should complete a Security Incident Report BSF152. Reporting procedures \nenable the CBSA to make important decisions regarding the safety and security of staff, ongoing \ntraining needs, and the recognition of exemplary performance in difficult situations. \n7.5 Attending a pre-hearing conference \nThe ID may require the parties to participate in a pre-hearing conference to discuss issues, \nreview disclosure of information and the procedures to be followed in the case at hand. \n[Immigration Division Rules (ID Rules), Rule 20(1)]. The ID may require the parties to give any \ninformation or document at or before the conference [Immigration Division Rules, Rule 20(2)]. \nRule 20(3) of the Immigration Division Rules provides that the ID must state orally at the hearing \nor make a written record of any decisions or agreements made at the conference. It is important \nthat all decisions or agreements made at the conference are clearly outlined in the hearings \nofficer’s notes, as the parties at the hearing will be bound by them. \n7.6 Use of a designated representative\n2022-03-03 \n \n17 \nRule 18 of the Immigration Division Rules stipulates that counsel for a party has a duty to notify \nthe ID if they believe that they should designate a representative for the person concerned. It is \nhowever the responsibility of the ID to ensure a designated representative is identified at the \nproceedings.  \nHearings officers should ensure that the ID is notified in advance of the potential need for a \ndesignated representative by completing the appropriate section in the form BSF524 — Request \nfor Admissibility Hearing/Detention Review Pursuant to the Immigration Division Rules. A \nrepresentative  must be 18 or older, understand the nature of the proceedings, be willing to act in \nthe best interests of the permanent resident or foreign national, and not have interests that \nconflict with those of the permanent resident or foreign national. \nThe ID is obligated to appoint a designated representative for any person who is the subject of an \nadmissibility hearing or a detention review if this person is under the age of 18 years (a \"minor\") \nor is unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings IRPA, as directed in subsection 167(2)).  \nThe IRB’s commentary to Rule 19 defines “the inability to appreciate the nature of the \nproceedings” as not being able to understand the reason for the hearing or why it is important or \ncannot give meaningful instructions to counsel about one’s case.  \nThe same IRB commentary states that an opinion regarding competency may be based on the \nperson's own admission, the person's observable behavior at the proceeding, or on expert opinion \non the person's mental health or intellectual or physical faculties. \n \nLikewise, the commentary states that the authority to designate a representative or end a \ndesignation rests with the ID member presiding at the hearing. In the case of a minor, if the \nperson reaches 18 years of age while the proceedings are still ongoing, the designation ends \nautomatically, by operation of law.  \n7.7 Language of the proceedings \nThe Immigration Division Rules, Rules 3(g), 8(1)(d) and 16(1) clearly indicate that the language \nof the proceedings —English or French— must be chosen by the person subject to them. \nAt the request of the person concerned the IRB may make arrangements to provide interpretation \nfrom one official language to the other, taking into consideration third language \ninterpretation may also be required for the case. That being said, the responsibility for the \ntranslation of documentary evidence rests with the party disclosing the information. Information \nprovided by the Minister is governed under ID rule 3 for admissibility hearings and ID rule 8 for \ndetention reviews The Minister is generally expected to speak and disclose documents the \nofficial language of the hearing.  \nIn the case of 48-hour detention reviews, official language fluency of counsel for the person may \nbe unknown at the time that the Request for admissibility hearing/detention review pursuant to \nthe Immigration Division Rules [BSF524] was submitted to the ID. Prior to the proceedings, the \nhearings officer should ensure that any official languages interpretation needs for counsel are \nflagged to the ID.\n2022-03-03 \n \n18 \n7.8 Interpretation \nThe presence of an interpreter in the hearing room may alter the way the hearings officer \npresents their submissions. At, or prior to, the ID member’s opening statement, it must be \nestablished if the person concerned wishes to have simultaneous interpretation, or if they prefer \nthe interpreter remain on standby and provide interpretation only at the person’s request. The \nperson’s choice will be noted on the record by the member. (see ID rule 17 for requesting an \ninterpreter). \nWhere simultaneous interpretation is conducted, the hearings officer must be mindful of their \npace, and speak in relatively short but complete sentences.  \nThe interpretation of strings of numbers, in particular, can slow down the proceedings; hearings \nofficers may reconsider the relevance of quoting elements such as case numbers or phone \nnumbers, and determine whether or not it is necessary to cite them during their submissions. \nIf quoting extensive volumes of text, especially legal texts with precise terminology, the \ninterpreter should be provided a written copy to serve as a visual aid to the interpretation. \n7.9 Rights of the person concerned \n \nThe principles of natural justice and procedural fairness require that the person concerned should \nfully understand the nature and purpose of the proceeding. Acting as a safeguard for individuals \nin their interaction with the state, the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness \nstipulate that whenever a person’s “rights, privileges, or interests” are at stake, there is a duty to \nact in a fair manner. \nID members must comply with the principle of natural justice and procedural fairness, which \nmeans the rights that persons concerned have include: \n the right to adequate notice of a hearing; \n the right to disclosure (to know the case that has to be met);  \n the right to know the possible consequences of the hearing; \n the right to be heard (to make submissions, the right to present evidence, and cross-\nexamine witnesses.”); and \n the right to a fair and impartial decision-maker. \nIRPA and the IRPR are also bound by the Charter and are required to respect the rights afforded \ntherein. These rights include, but are not limited to \n The right to life, liberty and security of person and the right not to be deprived thereof \nexcept in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice [section 7 of the Charter]. \n The right on arrest or detention [section 10 of the Charter]:  \no to be informed promptly of the reasons for the arrest or detention; \no to be informed without delay of the right to retain and instruct counsel; and\n2022-03-03 \n \n19 \no to have the validity of a detention determined and to be released from detention if \nthe detention is not lawful. \n The right to the assistance of an interpreter: in all proceedings in which the person \nconcerned is a party or a witness before a court or tribunal, and does not understand or \nspeak the language in which such proceedings are being conducted or if the person \nconcerned is deaf [section 14 of the Charter; Rule 17 of the ID Rules]. \n The right to be represented: The person concerned has the right to obtain the services of, \nand to be represented by legal or other counsel for all proceedings before the ID. \nAlthough IRPA does not specifically provide for it, the right to be represented implies \nthat the person concerned shall be informed of this right and shall be given a reasonable \nopportunity to obtain and instruct counsel or the services of a representative at their own \nexpense, if so desired [A167]. \nNote: Pursuant to A91 no person shall knowingly, directly or indirectly, represent or advise a \nperson for consideration – or offer to do so – in connection with a proceeding or application \nunder the IRPA. A person does not contravene subsection 91(1) where they are: lawyers in good \nstanding of a law society of a province or a notary who is a member in good standing of the \nChambre des notaires du Québec; any other member in good standing of a law society of a \nprovince or the Chambre des notaries du Québec, including a paralegal; or a member in good \nstanding of a body designated by the Minister (e.g., College of Immigration and Citizenship \nConsultants) – refer to the Regulations Designating a Body for the Purposes of Paragraph \n91(2)(c) of the IRPA SOR/2011-142 dated June 28, 2011 - https://laws-\nlois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2011-142/FullText.html. For further information on who \ncan represent or provide advice to a client refer to A91 of IRPA \nSection 91 does not apply where a person provides representation or advice without receiving \ncompensation, this may include a friend, or in some cases a representative of an organization or \nassociation, so long as no  monetary or other enumeration is received to represent or advise the \nperson concerned.  \n7.10 Compellability of person concerned  \nThe testimony of the person concerned is often the principal source of evidence available to the \nMinister in admissibility hearings and detention reviews. The courts have held that persons \nconcerned are compellable witnesses because they are protected against self-incrimination by the \nCanada Evidence Act (for example, Suresh v Canada MPSEP 2017 FC 28 at paragraphs 70-74) \nThis means that testimony given by the person concerned at a proceeding before the ID cannot \nbe used in criminal proceedings. \nIn the context of detention reviews,  Brown v Canada 2020 FCA 130 at paragraph 122, the \nCourt said that the detainee is not required to do anything, and not required to produce evidence \nin response. Compellability has not been definitively resolved for detention reviews. \nParagraph 11(c) of the Charter stipulates that individuals who are accused of an offence cannot \nbe forced to testify at their own trial. However, paragraph 11(c) of the Charter does not apply\n2022-03-03 \n \n20 \nbecause the person concerned is not a “person charged with an offence” [Bowen v. Minister of \nEmployment and Immigration; Almrei (Re) (paras 68; and 74)].  \nA person at an admissibility hearing who refuses to take an oath, make a solemn declaration or \naffirmation, or answer a question, commits an offence and may be prosecuted under A127(c). \n7.11 Disclosure of information \nAt an admissibility hearing and/or a detention review, hearings officers have an obligation to \npresent all the relevant and admissible evidence to the ID member, the person concerned or, if \napplicable, to the counsel for the person concerned. (ID rule 3) This is achieved through the \npreparation of a disclosure package, which will contain the documentary evidence that will be \nrelied on at the proceedings. Any tangible evidence including documents, photographs, audio \nrecordings, video recordings, diagrams, and any kind of object can form part of disclosure.  \nThe FCA in  Brown v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FCA 130  at para 142-143 & \n145 modified the Minister’s obligation to disclose all relevant information, even information that \nthe Minister does not rely upon, including information that can be to the sole benefit of the \nperson concerned. \nHearings officers must be mindful that their submissions must be based on evidence that was \ndisclosed or otherwise gathered from a witness during testimony at the hearing.  Hearings \nofficers cannot testify (i.e. generate their own evidence, whether orally or in writing) during a \nhearing where they act as the Minister’s representative. \n7.11.1 Protecting information \nAs set out by Rule 3 of the Immigration Division Rules, for an admissibility hearing the Minister \nmust disclose any relevant information and document that the Minister may have in its \npossession to the ID and the permanent resident or foreign national.  \nIn specific circumstances there may be times when hearings officers must ensure certain \ninformation remains protected from disclosure to the person concerned or to otherwise prevent \nthe information from becoming public. Although the Minister has an obligation to disclose all \nrelevant information, the hearings officer must balance this obligation with a duty to protect \ncertain  information from disclosure. This includes disclosure that may damage a third party, an \nongoing investigation, or national security such as: private information of a third party, \ninformation that might reveal the identity of an informant, law enforcement investigation \ntechniques, and classified intelligence. \nHearings officers may invoke privilege over some of the information it possesses, pursuant to \ncertain provisions of the Canada Evidence Act. In national security cases especially, they may \n[also] need to file an application to the ID for non-disclosure pursuant to A86. \nThe Danger Assessments Section & National Security Cases unit at Headquarters oversees the \nmanagement of cases involving the use of classified information. If the hearings officer is\n2022-03-03 \n \n21 \ncontemplating filing an application pursuant to A86, their manager should contact the NSCU \n(National_Security_Cases@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) at the earliest opportunity. Authorisation to proceed \nwith the application must be granted by the NSCU and NHQ Intelligence and Enforcement \nBranch- Hearings Unit (Hearings-Audiences-Programs@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca). \nHearings officers and advisors seeking guidance on invoking privilege under the Canada \nEvidence Act to protect some information from disclosure may reach out to the Intelligence and \nEnforcement Branch- Hearings Unit at Headquarters if they require guidance or information of \nthe process (Hearings-Audiences-Programs@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca). \nFor additional information about applications for non-disclosure, refer to ENF 31. \n7.11.2 Rules of evidence \nThe rules governing the admissibility and presentation of evidence before the ID are less \nrestrictive than in judicial proceedings. Unlike courts, the ID is not bound by any legal or \ntechnical rules of evidence [A173(c)] (e.g., the ID is not bound by the hearsay rule or the best \nevidence rule) [Refer to Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Dan-Ash; Canada \n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Nkunzimana; 2005 FC 29 at para 13; Bruzzese v. \nCanada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2106 FC 1119 at para , 50]. \nID members may receive and base decisions on any evidence adduced in the proceeding that \nthey consider credible or trustworthy [A173(d)].  \nFor additional information on Rules of Evidence, refer to Appendix A, Section 2. \n7.12 Witnesses  \nIf the hearings officer decides to call witnesses (other than the person concerned) to testify on \nbehalf of the Minister, the hearings officer must inform the person concerned or the person’s \ncounsel, if applicable, and the ID in writing. Details on the contents of this notification as the \napplicable deadlines are set out in Rule 32 of the ID Rules. \nIn the case of expert testimony, a summary of the expert testimony must be included in the \nnotification. In this regard, the admission of expert evidence depends on the following criteria: \n(i) relevance (ii) necessity in assisting the trier of fact (iii) the absence of any exclusionary rule, \nand (iv) a properly qualified expert [R. v. Mohan, R. v. Sekhon, R. v. Mohan at para 17; and R. v. \nSekhon  at para 43]. \nIf there are reasons to doubt that a witness will appear as requested, and if time permits, the \nhearings officer may make an application in writing to the ID to request a summons \n[Immigration Division Rules, Rule 33]. \nPersonal information concerning witnesses and their testimony may consist of information that \nrequires non-disclosure protection. In such cases, the hearings officer should make an application\n2022-03-03 \n \n22 \nfor non-disclosure. For information on an application for non-disclosure, refer to section 7.11.1 \nabove. \n7.12.1 Exclusion of witnesses \nDuring the hearing the member will ask counsel and the hearings officer if there are any potential \nwitnesses present in the room. If so, the member will ask the witnesses to leave the room, except \nfor the person concerned (natural justice and procedural fairness provides that the person \nconcerned has the right to hear the case against them and to attend the admissibility hearing that \nconcerns them) and any expert witnesses (hearings officers may wish for expert witnesses to hear \nthe evidence presented orally at the hearing). \nThe member may also remind everyone that witnesses must refrain from discussing the contents \nof their testimony outside the hearing room [Immigration Division Rules, Rule 36]. \n7.12.2 Examining and cross-examining witnesses  \n \nIt is recommended that hearings officers prepare a strategy on questioning witnesses prior to the \nadmissibility hearing. The strategy should be based on the case at hand and on the facts hearings \nofficers want to prove in order to satisfy the elements of the allegation. \nConsidering and anticipating potential responses beforehand will help hearings officers to \nmaintain control of the examination and ensure that important facts are captured.  \nThe following general guidelines may be useful in conducting a cross-examination: \n \nPrepare a list of general areas to cover rather than  a list of questions to be followed \nrigidly. This will allow hearing officers to respond more effectively to witnesses’ \ntestimonies and adapt their questions to witnesses’ answers.  \n \nQuestions should be geared towards satisfying the elements of the inadmissibility to \nprovide reasonable grounds or a balance of probabilities. \n \nThe use of open-ended questions that do not make the direction of questioning obvious to \nthe witness is suggested in situations where hearings officers are looking to obtain as \nmuch information as possible.   \n \nThe use of leading questions – that is, questions which suggest an answer – is \nrecommended in circumstances where the facts are not in dispute or when a witness is \nproviding to be uncooperative.  \n \nHearings officers should avoid asking questions for which the answer is not known as \nthis may have unexpected or undesired results (fishing expeditions can have unexpected \nresults). \n \nEnsure that the order and type of questions are varied and well-adapted to the answer the \nwitness is providing. Depending on the answers of the witness it may be necessary for the \nhearings officer to modify their plan for questioning witnesses and for introducing \nevidence.\n2022-03-03 \n \n23 \n \nTake notes of the key aspects of the testimony given by witnesses throughout the \nadmissibility hearing to more efficiently prepare and deliver submissions to the member \nof the ID. \n \nAll parties to the proceedings may ask to see the notes that witnesses use to assist with \ntheir testimony, and may demand that these notes be introduced as an exhibit. \n \nIf cross-examination conducted by counsel for the person concerned raises new \ninformation, it may be useful and/or necessary to ask a witness additional questions after \nthe cross-examination has been closed.  \n \nObjections may be raised at any time during the admissibility hearing and hearings \nofficers may raise objections and respond to the objections raised by the other party. \nAll testimony is given under oath (by swearing on a holy book) or by affirmation (a solemn \npromise to tell the truth). \nProcedural aspects of cross-examinations:  \nProcedural fairness is engaged during the cross-examination process, especially when it is the \nintention of the hearings officer to call into questions the credibility of a witness (Browne v. \nDunn 1893 6 R 67; R v. Lyttle 1 S.C.R. 193, 2004 SCC 5).  \n8 Applications to the board \n \n8.1 General \nAt any time during an admissibility hearing or a detention review, the person concerned and/or \nthe hearings officer may present an application in accordance with the ID Rules (e.g., application \nto change the date or time of a hearing (Rule 43), application to change location of the hearing \n(Rule 42), application for the non-disclosure of information (Rule 41), application to join or \nseparate hearings (Rule 44), application to conduct the hearing in private (Rule 45), application \nto adjourn, etc.). While some of these applications are specifically provided for under the ID \nRules, where the ID Rules do not provide for a specific process, hearings officers may rely on \nthe general provisions for applications found at ID Rules 37-40. \n8.2 Public versus private hearings \nIn accordance with A166(a), hearings before the ID must be held in public. \nHowever, subject to A166(d), proceedings concerning persons who are refugee protection \nclaimants must be held in private. This includes admissibility hearings, detention reviews, pre-\nhearing conferences and all other applications heard by the ID.  \nIf, during continued detention, the person initiates a refugee claim, the hearings officer should \nnotify the ID forthwith, as all subsequent hearings will be held in private.\n2022-03-03 \n \n24 \nHowever, the ID member may, on request by a party to the proceeding or on the ID member’s \nown initiative, (IRPA 166(d)) ; \n \nin the case of a person claiming refugee protection, order that a hearing be held in public; \n \nin other cases, order that a hearing be held in private or make any other order to ensure \nthe confidentiality of the proceedings (A166) as follows:  \no When the ID member notes that there are observers present, the ID member \ndetermines if it is appropriate to allow these observers to remain or if they should \nbe asked to leave.  \no Pursuant to A166(e), representatives or agents of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are entitled to observe proceedings \nconcerning protected persons and persons who have made a claim for refugee \nprotection. \no Pursuant to A166(f), representatives or agents of the UNHCR may not observe \nproceedings that deal with information or other evidence that is protected under \nA86 or for which an application for non-disclosure has been made under A86 and \nthe application was not rejected.  \n“Refugee protection claimant” means \n \na person who has made a claim for refugee protection and whose eligibility has not yet \nbeen determined; or \n \na person who has made a claim for refugee protection and whose claim has been \ndetermined to be eligible; or \n \na person who has made a claim for refugee protection and whose claim has been decided \nby the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), but who has not exhausted all appeals of the \ndecision before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD);  \nbut does not mean  \n \na person whose claim for refugee protection has been determined to be ineligible; or \n \na person who has made a claim for refugee protection has been rejected by the court of \nlast resort. \nAccording to the interpretation of the Court in Gervasoni v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration) at para 13, the objectives of the IRPA pertaining to public hearings are met “if \ninterested members of the public are not unreasonably restricted from attending the [hearing].” \n8.3 Application for proceeding in-camera (in private) \nIf the ID member is satisfied that: \n There is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of the person concerned will \nbe endangered if the proceeding is held in public;\n2022-03-03 \n \n25 \n there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the proceeding such that the need to \nprevent disclosure outweighs the social interest that the proceeding be conducted in \npublic; or \n there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed, \nthe ID member may on application, or on the ID member’s own initiative, conduct a proceeding \nin-camera (in private) or take any other measure to ensure the confidentiality of the proceedings \n(A166(b)(I, ii, iii); ID Rules, Rule 45; Pacific Press Ltd v. Canada (Minister of Employment and \nImmigration). \n8.4 Application for non-disclosure of information or other evidence \n \nRefer to section 7.11.1 above for more details on applications for non-disclosure pursuant to \nA86. \n8.5 Application for a change of venue \nRequests for a change of venue must be made to the ID [ID Rule 42]. \nWhen deciding if the application for a change of venue should be allowed, the ID member must \nconsider any relevant factors, including: \n whether a change of location would allow the hearing to be full and proper; \n whether a change of location would likely delay or slow the hearing; \n how a change of location would affect the operation of the ID; \n how a change of location would affect the parties; and \n whether a change of location would endanger public safety. \n \n8.6 Application for adjournment \n \nA162(2) stipulates that the ID shall deal with all proceedings as informally and as quickly as the \ncircumstances permit. Notwithstanding this provision, adjournments may be necessary to ensure \nthat the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice are respected. Parties to the \nadmissibility hearing may make an application for adjournment as outlined in rule 43 of the ID  \nRules.  \n \n8.6.1 Mandatory adjournments \n \nThe ID member must grant a request for adjournment in the following circumstances: \n \nTo allow a minor child or a person who is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings to \nbe appointed a designated representative. If the ID member is of the opinion that the party is \nnot adequately represented, the member may designate a representative [A167(2); Immigration \nDivision Rules, Rules 18 and 19].\n2022-03-03 \n \n26 \nWhere the services of an interpreter are required to permit the presence of an interpreter at the \nadmissibility hearing [Immigration Division Rules, Rule 17]. \nWhen the person concerned claims Canadian citizenship, and had it not been for this claim a \nremoval order would have been issued; and \nWhen a hearings officer requests that a dependent family member be included in the removal \norder issued to the person concerned, and the ID member is not convinced that the family \nmember was notified accordingly, using the “Notice of Admissibility Hearing to Family \nMembers” form (BSF 540). \n \n8.6.2 Discretionary adjournments \n \nIn cases that do not involve one or more of the mandatory circumstances, ID members have \ndiscretion to grant adjournments in accordance with the principles of procedural fairness and \nnatural justice [Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)], or under the \ngeneral powers conferred on the member as a commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries Act.  \nThe principles of natural justice and procedural fairness require that the ID member consider an \nadjournment request by hearing submissions from both parties and by balancing their interests. \nMembers must also take into consideration whether an adjournment will have a negative effect \non the efficiency and expediency of the process.  \nHearings officers must adequately support the recommendations against or in favour of \nadjourning an admissibility hearing by submitting valid reasons and by making reference to the \nrelevant case law.  \nBased on the SCC decision in Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), ID \nmembers should consider the following factors when deciding whether an adjournment should be \ngranted (paras 35 and 36): \n the number of adjournments granted previously; \n the length of time for which an adjournment is requested; \n the timeliness of pursuing other remedies before asking for an adjournment; and \n in certain circumstances, sympathy for the concerned person’s circumstances.  \nWhen applying for an adjournment, hearings officers should address all the applicable factors \n[Immigration Division Rules, Rule 43]. \nAdjournments may also be granted at the discretion of the ID member or under the general \npowers conferred on the member as a commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries Act. Both \nparties may make arguments in favour of an adjournment. An ID member may grant an \nadjournment for the following reasons, among other grounds: \n to allow the person concerned to retain counsel (A167); \n for either party to obtain additional evidence or to summon witnesses; \n to allow relevant documents to be introduced (e.g. evidence of a conviction outside \nCanada);\n2022-03-03 \n \n27 \n to have the person concerned medically examined or to secure additional medical \nevidence; \n to replace an incompetent interpreter or counsel; \n to consult with the Registrar of Canadian Citizenship; and  \n to allow an ID member to prepare the decision. \n \n8.6.3 Adjournments to obtain counsel \n \nOver the years it has often been argued before the courts that refusal to grant an adjournment for \nthe purpose of obtaining counsel of choice was tantamount to depriving a person of the right to \nretain and instruct counsel. To this end, the hearings officer can argue that the right to counsel \nsimply means that the person concerned must be given the opportunity to retain and instruct \ncounsel of choice amongst those who are ready and available to proceed on the date fixed by the \nmember of the ID. Pierre v Canada (Minister of Manpower & Immigration), [1978] 2 F.C. 849, \n[1978] 2 A.C.W.S. 285 (FCCA) (concurring opinion of Kelly, DJ) \n \nThe person concerned must be given sufficient time to secure counsel. However, hearings \nofficers should object to long adjournments when they are of the opinion that the subject of the \nadmissibility hearing has had reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel who is willing and able to \nhandle the case. In such cases, the hearings officer will argue that the person should take the \nnecessary action to find other counsel. If counsel is never available or does not appear when \nrequired, the hearings officer should request that a peremptory resumption date be set. \nThe hearings officer should argue that the Charter does not grant an unrestricted right to counsel \nof choice. Clients have the right to be represented, but by counsel who is reasonably available to \nappear before the tribunal. Counsel is also obliged by a code of ethics not to take on cases where \nthey are not reasonably available to appear on behalf of clients because of previous \ncommitments. \nIf counsel makes continuous requests for adjournment, hearings officers may oppose these \nrequests and provide reasons for why the request for adjournment is not justified.  \nIn exceptional circumstances, the hearings officer may notify the office manager to consider \nwhether a formal complaint to the provincial bar association or law society may be warranted. \nNHQ   Hearings Unit of the Intelligence and Enforcement Branch  (Hearings-Audiences-\nPrograms@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) should be informed of all such formal complaints. \nHearings officers should review the file to determine if the person concerned has in the past \nasked for an adjournment for similar reasons (e.g., to obtain counsel). Before arguing for or \nagainst a proposed adjournment, hearings officers should take into account the stage the \nadmissibility hearing has reached and the anticipated length of the adjournment requested. \nHearings officers should base their submissions on the factors that are applicable to the particular \ncase at hand.\n2022-03-03 \n \n28 \n8.6.4 Application for postponement by the opposing party \nIf the hearings officer receives a request for postponement of an admissibility hearing from the \nperson concerned or from counsel, the hearings officer must advise the person concerned or \ncounsel that the request must be made to the ID [Rule 43(1)]. The Minister does not accept \napplications on behalf of the ID.  \nA detention review will proceed as originally scheduled notwithstanding a postponement of an \nadmissibility hearing that was scheduled to be heard immediately before or after a detention \nreview. \nNote: Refer to Appendix B for additional information on adjournments and jurisprudence. \n8.7 Post-hearing reporting and feedback \n \nHearings officers or delegated staff must enter all relevant information in the Global Case \nManagement System (GCMS) and the National Case Management System (NCMS) as soon as \npossible to keep the case information current. \nResults of admissibility hearings or detention review proceedings should be provided to the \nofficers who prepared and reviewed the original report, or who arrested and detained the \npermanent resident or the foreign national under the provisions of IRPA. \nHearings officers should provide feedback to those involved in specific cases for training \npurposes, and to advise officers of the effectiveness of their work.  \n \n9 Definitions \nNo information available.\n2022-03-03 \n \n29 \n10 Procedures - The admissibility hearing \n10.1 General \nAdmissibility proceedings are held under the jurisdiction of the ID to determine the merits of \nallegations of inadmissibility under IRPA and to take applicable removal measures, if \nappropriate.  \nPursuant to subsection A44(1), an officer who is of the opinion that a permanent resident or a \nforeign national who is in Canada, is inadmissible may prepare a report setting out the relevant \nfacts and transmit the report to a Minister’s Delegate (MD).  \n \nAn MD who is of the opinion that the A44(1) report is well founded may refer the report to the \nID for an admissibility hearing in the following instances:  \n \nIn the case of a foreign national who may be inadmissible to Canada on one or more \ngrounds for which the MD has no jurisdiction to issue a removal order (refer to R229);  \n \nin the case of a permanent resident, except for a report solely based on non-compliance \nof the permanent resident with the residency obligations under A28. \nIf the MD is of the opinion that the report is well founded, they must also refer the A44(1) report \nto the ID of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) for an admissibility hearing in the \nfollowing situations as prescribed under r228: \n \nIn the case of a minor child who is not accompanied by a parent or adult legally \nresponsible for the child [R228(4)(a)]; and, \n \nin the case of a person who is unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings and is \nnot accompanied by a parent or adult legally responsible for the person [R228(4)(b)]. \nThe MD must complete and send the following forms, along with the file and supporting \ndocumentary evidence, to the Hearings and Detention Unit of the Enforcement and Intelligence \nDivision in the respective Region:  \nA44(1)\nThe officer prepares a \nreport alleging a \nperson is inadmissible\nA44(2)\nThe report is reviewed by \na Minister's Delegate \n(MD)\nIf the matter forms part of the \ncircumstances found in R228(1), R228(2 \nand R228(3), the MD has jurisdiction to \nissue the removal order\nIn all other cases —R228(4) and R229—\nthe report is referred to the Immigration \nDivision for an admissibility hearing.\n2022-03-03 \n \n30 \n \nReferral Under Subsection A44(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for an \nAdmissibility Hearing (BSF 506);  \n \nRequest for Admissibility Hearing/Detention Review Pursuant to the Immigration \nDivision Rules (BSF 524) \nNote: The Regional Hearings and Detention Section forwards copies of both forms to the ID and \nretains copies on file. For detention cases, the MD must send a copy of the A44(1) report, forms \nBSF506 and BSF 524 directly to the ID and the Regional Hearings Office without delay. The \ndocumentary evidence should also be sent to the Regional Hearings Office as soon as possible. \nFor more information on preparing and writing A44(1) reports, refer to ENF 5, Writing 44(1) \nReports.  \nFor more information on administrative removal orders refer to ENF 6, Administrative removal \norders. \n10.2 Port of entry (POE) referral for an admissibility hearing \nIf the MD, after reviewing a report made pursuant to A44(1), determines that the report is well-\nfounded, he or she may refer it to the ID of the IRB for an admissibility hearing. Where the \ndecision to refer to the ID is made under A44(2) and the person leaves the POE, the examination \nof the person has ended (R37(1)(d)).  \nHowever, if the person concerned was referred to an admissibility hearing and the referral is \nwithdrawn, the examination is not concluded and the case must be returned to the POE for \ndetermination.  \nNote: Refer to ENF 4: Port of Entry Examinations, section 5.6, for additional information on end \nof examination, and ENF 6: Review of reports under subsection 44(2) Section 12 Allowing \nwithdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed to leave (Port of entry cases) \n10.3 Burden of proof \nThe burden of proof is the obligation to prove or disprove a disputed fact. In the immigration \ncontext, it refers to who is responsible for establishing admissibility. A45(d) governs which party \nholds the burden of proof depending on the specific circumstances of the case.  \n \n10.3.1 Permanent residents and foreign nationals who have been authorized to enter \nCanada. \nOn a matter involving permanent residents or foreign nationals (who have been authorized to \nenter Canada), the burden of proof rests with the Minister to establish that the person is \ninadmissible.\n2022-03-03 \n \n31 \nDuring an admissibility hearing, hearings officers must be prepared to offer evidence to support \nthe allegation(s) of inadmissibility and rebut any statements that are made by the foreign national \nor the permanent resident in order to meet the applicable standard of proof (refer to section 10.4) \nof the existence of facts that constitute inadmissibility. If the Minister is unable to meet this \nburden, the ID member shall determine that the person concerned is not inadmissible, even if the \nperson concerned does not produce evidence to the contrary. For a list of all the ID’s possible \ndecisions following an admissibility hearing refer to A45. \nOn the other hand, if the Minister meets the burden of proof, it is up to the person concerned to \nrefute the Minister’s evidence, in other words, to prove that these facts do not exist. \n \n10.3.2 Foreign nationals who have not been authorized to enter Canada \nFor foreign nationals who have not been authorized to enter Canada, the burden of proof rests \nwith the foreign national to prove that they are not inadmissible to Canada. This applies to the \nfollowing: \n persons seeking to enter Canada; and \n persons who are in Canada without legal authorization. \nIt is up to the person concerned to disprove the evidence presented by the Minister that constitute \ninadmissibility. Nonetheless, since the Minister is the party who initiates the admissibility \nhearing process,  it is the Minister who presents evidence first, on the facts that constitute the \nbasis for inadmissibility. \n10.4 Standard of proof \nSince immigration proceedings are civil in nature, the general standard of proof applicable to \ncivil matters (balance of probabilities) applies to most inadmissibilities. Consequently, the \nMinister does not have to prove the existence of facts beyond a reasonable doubt (criminal \nstandard of proof), but rather has to demonstrate that the Minister’s version of the facts is more \nprobable than the version of the person concerned. This means that the evidence presented must \nshow that the facts as alleged are more probable than not. \nHowever, A33 of IRPA provides that for allegations of inadmissibility listed under A34 to A37, \nevidence is to be evaluated according the standard of proof, of “reasonable grounds to believe” \nthat the facts have occurred, are occurring or may occur. In Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of \nCitizenship and Immigration), the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the ruling of the Federal \nCourt of Appeal that the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard requires something more than \nmere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the “balance of \nprobabilities” [Sivakumar v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration, p. 445) and \nChiau v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (paragraph 60)]. The reasonable \ngrounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling \nand credible information [Sabour v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)].\n2022-03-03 \n \n32 \nThe following table summarizes the standard of proof for sections A34 to A42: \nStandard of proof \nReasonable grounds to believe  \nBalance of probabilities  \n \n \nCommitted/Committing an act outside \nCanada as described in 36(1)(c)— Note: \napplies only to foreign nationals] \n \nSecurity (A34) \n \nViolation of human or international rights \n(A35) \n \nSerious criminality and criminality (A36), \nNote: except for A36(1)(c) for permanent \nresidents \n \nOrganized crime (A37) \n \n \nCommitted/Committing an act outside \nCanada as described in 36(1)(c)— Note: \napplies only to permanent residents] \n \nHealth reasons (A38)  \n \nFinancial reasons (A39 ) \n \nMisrepresentation (A40) \n \nCessation of refugee protection (A40.1) \n \nNon-compliance with the Act (A41) \n \nInadmissible family member (A42) \n \n10.5 Rules of evidence \nAlthough members of the ID are not bound by the strict rules of evidence that apply to judicial \nproceedings, hearings officers should be aware of the following: \n \nthe admissibility of evidence;  \n \nthe relevance of evidence; \n \nthe weight of evidence; and  \n \nthe different types of evidence, including documentary evidence and testimony (includes \ntestimony given by expert witnesses) Expert witnesses can only give evidence with respect to the \nsubject at issue. \nFor additional information about rules of evidence, refer to Appendix A.  \n10.6 Inadmissibility \nNotes: \n \nFor guidance on obtaining evidence for all inadmissibility provisions refer to ENF 1 – \nInadmissibility. \n \nFor essential case elements for all inadmissibility provisions, refer to ENF 2 – Evaluating \nInadmissibility.\n2022-03-03 \n \n33 \n10.7 Criminal equivalency between foreign and Canadian jurisdictions \nAs part of the inadmissibility determination under A36, it is necessary to determine if an offence \ncommitted outside Canada has an equivalent offence in Canadian law. This process is referred to \nas equivalency. \nSerious criminality inadmissibility findings apply to either a permanent resident or a foreign \nnational under A36(1). Criminality inadmissibility findings apply to a foreign national under \nA36(2). \nThe following provisions of IRPA raise the issue of equivalency with respect to serious \ncriminality and criminality:36(1)(b)  \nSerious criminality  \nForeign conviction for an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence \nunder an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years.  \n36(1)(c) – Serious criminalityCommitted an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place \nwhere it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an \nAct of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years.  \n36(2)(b) - Criminality \nForeign conviction for an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable \noffence under an Act of Parliament, or of two offences not arising out of a single occurrence that, \nif committed in Canada, would constitute offences under an Act of Parliament.  \n36(2)(c) – Criminality \nCommitted an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was committed and that, \nif committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament.  \nThe Federal Court provides the following guidance for equivalency \n“[…] the fundamental test of equivalence is: would the acts committed abroad and \npunished there have been punishable here?” [Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration) (paragraph 13)].  \nIn Hill v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), the Court described the following \nthree ways of establishing equivalency between a foreign and a domestic offence:  \n \ncompare the elements of the Canadian and foreign statutes to determine if both have the \nsame essential elements to substantiate the respective offences (the elements generally \ninclude mental and physical components);\n2022-03-03 \n \n34 \n \nexamine the evidence adduced before the ID member, both oral and documentary, to \nascertain whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that the essential ingredients of \nthe offence in Canada had been proven in the foreign proceedings; or \n \nby a combination of paragraphs 1 and 2.  \nRefer also to Park v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) (paragraph 14) and Patel v. Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration) (paragraph 4). \nOffences that are no longer offences in Canada will not render a foreign national inadmissible for \na crime under IRPA. IRCC’s policy position is to apply this decision to permanent residents and \nforeign nationals who are inadmissible on the ground of serious criminality for offences \ncommitted inside and outside of Canada under paragraphs A36(1)(a), (b) and (c). The policy \ndecision does not apply to subsection A36(2) criminality or to cases where the maximum \npunishment in Canada has become more lenient. \nWhen preparing a case that involves an offence in a foreign jurisdiction that may be equivalent to \nan offence in Canada, hearings officers should follow these steps:  \nStep 1 Identify the foreign offence. \nStep 2 \nObtain evidence on the foreign offence. You should address the following three areas: \n \nthe wording of the offence in the foreign statute; \n \nthe best proof of a conviction (see ENF1 Section 7 for acceptable types of \nevidence); \n \ndetails of what was actually done (the act). \nStep 3 Identify possible Canadian equivalent offence(s) \nStep 4 Break down each offence (Canadian and foreign) into its basic elements (see ENF2 \nSection 3.7 and ENF2 Appendix A) \nStep 5 Compare each foreign element to its Canadian equivalent and determine if the \nCanadian element is equal to, broader than or narrower than the foreign element. \nStep 6 \nWhen the Canadian element is narrower than the foreign element, you will be required \nto examine the act (the details of the offence) to determine whether the act committed \nsatisfies the Canadian element. \nStep 7 \nCome to an overall conclusion as to whether the foreign offence is equivalent to the \nCanadian offence by finding that the foreign elements are equal to or narrower that the \nCanadian element and where broader than the act in question meets the Canadian \nelement. \nStep 8 If you have equivalency, take into account the penalty for the Canadian offence at the \ntime the offence was committed to decide which allegation under A36 is appropriate. \nThe foreign law must be proven during the admissibility hearing by producing all the extracts \nrelevant to the offence, which will be entered as an exhibit. The relevant extracts should, as a \nrule, include the sections that define the terms used in describing the offence.\n2022-03-03 \n \n35 \nAs seen above, in the examination of equivalency, a determination is made as to whether each of \nthe essential elements of the foreign offence is present in the Canadian equivalent. The following \nare helpful ways to remember when you have equivalency: \n \nIf all of the elements exist in both statutes (Canadian and foreign), the offences are \nequivalent. It is not necessary for the wording of the two laws to be identical. For \nexample, the term “knowingly” may be equivalent to “knowing”, and the term “whoever” \nmay be equivalent to “any person”.  \n \nIf the foreign enactment is more restrictive than the Canadian enactment, both offences \nare equivalent, since the Canadian statute covers all the situations contemplated in the \nforeign statute. \n \nIf the foreign enactment is broader than the Canadian statute, or if the text includes \nsituations that do not lead to a criminal offence in Canada, there is no textual \nequivalency. However the analysis does not end there. It is then necessary to examine the \ncircumstances of the offence to determine if there is equivalency nonetheless. When this \nsituation arises, evidence should be submitted regarding the facts that were proven in the \ncriminal trial held outside Canada or, in cases where there is no conviction, evidence such \nas police reports may be relied upon to show that an offence was committed. When every \nessential element of the Canadian offence can be established, there is equivalence. \n \nThe hearings officer should identify for the benefit of the ID which constituting \nelement(s) of the Canadian offence is (are) not found in the text of the foreign offence. \nThe hearings officer should then identify the facts that establish each element in the \nCanadian offence by referring to exhibits or part of a testimony that prove these facts. \nExample of equivalency:  \nGeneral Laws of Massachusetts, Pt IV, Title I, Ch. 266, sec. 49— Burglarious \ninstruments; making; possession; use \nWhoever makes or mends, or begins to make or mend, or knowingly has in his \npossession, an engine, machine, tool or implement adapted and designed for cutting \nthrough, forcing or breaking open a building, room, vault, safe or other depository, in \norder to steal therefrom money or other property, or to commit any other crime, knowing \nthe same to be adapted and designed for the purpose aforesaid, with intent to use or \nemploy or allow the same to be used or employed for such purpose, or whoever \nknowingly has in his possession a master key designed to fit more than one motor \nvehicle, with intent to use or employ the same to steal a motor vehicle or other property \ntherefrom […] \nCriminal Code of Canada, sec 351(1) — Possession of break-in instruments \n 351 (1) Every person who, without lawful excuse, has in their possession any instrument \nsuitable for the purpose of breaking into any place, motor vehicle, vault or safe knowing \nthat the instrument has been used or is intended to be used for that purpose,\n2022-03-03 \n \n36 \nComparing the text of these two provisions we see that there is no textual equivalency. The \nCanadian offence is more restrictive since the instruments described under the Canadian offence \ndo not address the act of making or mending the break-in instruments. \nTo equate with the Canadian criminal code definition of breaking in, it is necessary to introduce \nevidence showing that person was found in possession of the instrument that was in working \norder to commit the offence and was not arrested while in the process of making said break-in \ninstrument. \nIn this example, the evidence that the foreign offence is equivalent to an offence committed in \nCanada could consist of the following: \n \nintroduction of the relevant sections of the foreign statute; and  \n \ntestimony of the person concerned describing the circumstances of their arrest and type of \ninstrument; or \n \nextracts of the transcript of the foreign trial identifying the nature of the instruments; or \n \ncopy of the foreign indictment which contains a description of the instruments found; or \n \ndocumentary evidence providing a description of the instruments. \nIn most admissibility hearings dealing with equivalency, the hearings officer will generally have \nto produce the following documents as exhibits, when available: \n \nevidence of the conviction, such as a certificate of conviction, a police report or a \nstatutory declaration outlining a telephone conversation with a police officer, court \nreporter, court records clerk, or any document originating from the authorities of the \ncountry where the conviction was handed down; \n \nthe legal description of the foreign offence; that is, the text of the statutory provision \nunder which the person was convicted; and  \n \nevidence (obtained from the charge or indictment or a similar document) of the \nparticulars of the offence [Brannson v. Canada (Minister of Employment and \nImmigration) (para. 4)]. In some cases, the certificate of conviction may contain \nsufficient information for the certificate to be used instead of the indictment. \nAfter further research and investigation, the hearings officer may find that the foreign conviction \nwould better equate to a Canadian offence other than the one initially identified by the Minister’s \ndelegate at the time of writing the report. The A44(1) report should refer to as many Canadian \nequivalents as is reasonably necessary. Refer to section 11.2 Additional allegations/amendments \nof the report for further guidance. \nFor additional information on documentary evidence, refer to ENF 2 Evaluating inadmissibility. \nNote: IRCC is the delegated department for policy oversight of A36. If required in some \ncomplex or atypical equivalency cases, hearings officers and their managers may contact the \nHearings Programs unit at NHQ (Hearings-Audiences-Programs@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) to seek  \nguidance from IRCC).\n2022-03-03 \n \n37 \n10.8. Serious criminal inadmissibility for committing and act outside Canada that would \nconstitute an offence in the foreign jurisdiction as well as in Canada [A36(1)(c)] \nTo establish inadmissibility under A36(1)(c), it is sufficient to prove that an act was committed \noutside Canada, that is an offence the place where it occurred and that the act, if committed in \nCanada would have constituted, at the time of its commission, an offence in Canada that would \nbe punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years. It is not necessary to \nprove the following facts: \n \nthat the person concerned was convicted of the offence outside Canada; \n \nthat charges or an indictment were laid; \n \nthat the wording of the foreign statute is equivalent to the wording of the Canadian \nlegislation; \n \nthat the person would receive a sentence of 10 years or more if sentenced in Canada. \nThe IRPA does not prevent the same facts from being the subject of two different allegations in \nthe same report [A44(1)]. If this is the case, the ID member presiding over the admissibility \nhearing is responsible for determining whether the facts constitute either of the inadmissibility \ngrounds alleged in the report.  \n \nNote:A36(1)(b) and A36(1)(c) are generally mutually exclusive (officers should use one \nallegation or the other for the same act); nevertheless, in case where the proof of foreign \nconviction is unreliable or may be called in question the A44(1) report may include two \nallegations: one relating to an equivalence [A36(1)(b) or A36(2)(b)] and one relating to an act or \nomission [A36(1)(c) or A36(2)(c)].  \n10.8.1 Committing an offence on entry to Canada [A36(2)(d)] \n \nFor the application of A36(2)(d), the hearings officer must ensure that the act committed was \ncontrary to an Act of Parliament that is prescribed by the IRPR.  R19 lists six prescribed Acts: \nthe Criminal Code, IRPA, Firearms Act, Customs Act, CDSA, and the Cannabis Act. Because an \nA36(2)(d) allegation can only be made in a ‘present tense’ scenario, all the evidence available to \nsupport it will originate from the port of entry. Hearings officers should rely on evidence such as \nstatutory declarations from officers, copies of officer’s notebook pages, reports, photos and or \nvideo surveillance footage.  \nNote: Information collected in the course administering the Customs Act may be protected. \nOfficers should familiarize themselves with section 107 of the Customs Act, which sets out the \nmodalities and conditions for the authorized use of customs information in the enforcement of \nthe IRPA . \nFor additional information on the use of A36(2)(d), refer to ENF 2\n2022-03-03 \n \n38 \n10.9 Foreign pardons \nPlease refer to IRCC’s Program Delivery Instructions (PDI) on Criminal Rehabilitation. The \neffect of a foreign pardon does not automatically render the person admissible to Canada. \nThe following must be taken into account:  \n \nIf the country's legal system is based on similar foundations and values as Canada’s, then \nthe foreign legislation must be examined to determine whether the effect of the pardon is \nto erase a conviction or merely recognize that rehabilitation has taken place. In the former \ncase, the person would not be inadmissible. In the latter case, the applicant is \ninadmissible and, subject to the prescribed period in R17, an application for rehabilitation \nmay be initiated by the person. \n \nIn the vast majority of cases, the applicant should be able to produce a copy of the \npardon. \n \nCanadian courts are not bound by a foreign pardon in which there is an absence of \nevidence as to the motivating considerations that led to the grant of a pardon by another \nstate jurisdiction. \n \nThree elements must be established before a foreign discharge or pardon may be \nrecognized:  \no 1) the foreign legal system as a whole must be similar to that of Canada; \no 2) the aim, content and effect of the specific foreign law must be similar to \nCanadian law; and \no 3) there must be no valid reason not to recognize the effect of the foreign law \n 10.10 Permanent Resident inadmissibility under A36(1)(a) \n \nCases of A44(1) reports alleging inadmissibility under A36(1)(a) for serious criminality in \nCanada, and referred to the ID, are usually very straightforward and therefore officers should aim \nto have them handled by way of written submissions instead of having the Minister’s \nrepresentative attend in-person. Hearings officers or hearings advisors must ensure that they are \nnot the authors of any evidence (such as statutory declarations) that is included in the disclosure. \nHearings officers must obtain the approval from the Member to participate in writing rather than \nby in-person attendance. This is done by submitting a written application pursuant to ID Rule 38, \nseeking a release from the obligation to appear at the hearing, which is set out in ID Rule 42(3) \nand 43(3). Where the Member denies the application, the hearings officer is obligated to attend \nin person. \nIn some cases, where the issue is not straightforward, the hearings officer may determine that \ntheir in-person presence at the hearing is required. Before attending the hearing, the hearings \nofficer must first obtain their manager’s written approval to appear in person for A36(1)(a) cases \nand place a signed copy their manager’s approval on file.  \n \nFor the applicable templates, refer to Appendix C and D.\n2022-03-03 \n \n39 \n \n10.11 Family inadmissibility A42(1) \nAccording to A42(1), a foreign national, other than a protected person, is inadmissible on \ngrounds of an inadmissible family member in the following two instances:  \n(a) their accompanying family member, or, in prescribed circumstances, non-\naccompanying family member is inadmissible; or \n(b) they are an accompanying family member of an inadmissible person \nFor the purpose of paragraph A42(1)(a), the prescribed circumstances are described in section \nR23. That section addresses situations where the foreign national is inadmissible on the ground \nof an inadmissible non-accompanying family member where the foreign national made an \napplication for temporary residence status, or a permanent resident visa, or an application to \nremain in Canada as a temporary resident or a permanent resident; and where the non-\naccompanying family member is: \n \nThe spouse of the foreign national, except where the relationship between them has \nbroken down in law or in fact, \n \nThe common-law partner of the foreign national, \n \nA dependent child of the foreign national and where either the foreign national or an \naccompanying family member of the foreign national has custody of that child or is \nempowered to act on behalf of that child by virtue of a court order or a written agreement \nor by operation of law, or \n \nThe dependent child of the dependent child of the foreign national and where the foreign \nnational, or a dependent child of the foreign national, or any other accompanying family \nmember of the foreign national has custody of that child or is empowered to act on behalf \nof that child by virtue of a court order or a written agreement or by operation of law. \nSubsection A42(2) provides an exception to inadmissibility that would occur pursuant to \nsubsection A42(1). This exception applies only in the temporary resident context. The exception \napplies where a foreign national is a temporary resident, or where a foreign national has made an \napplication for temporary resident status, or an application to remain in Canada as a temporary \nresident, and where: \n \nThe matters referred to in paragraph A42(1)(a) constitute inadmissibility only if the \nfamily member is inadmissible under sections A34 (security concerns), A35 (human or \ninternational rights violations), or A37 (organized criminality). \n \nThe matters referred to in paragraph A42(1)(b) constitute inadmissibility only if the \nforeign national is an accompanying family member of a person who is inadmissible \nunder sections A34 (security concerns), A35 (human or international rights violations), or \nA37 (organized criminality). \nFor reference, subsections A42(1) and (2) can be summarized in the following table:\n2022-03-03 \n \n40 \n \nInadmissibility of the principal applicant (PA) on the ground of inadmissible family member \nother than a protected person \nInadmissibility \ngrounds of the \nsubject of an \nadmissibility \nhearing \nForeign national is an accompanying family \nmember (AFM) of a principal applicant who \nForeign national is a non-accompanying \nfamily member (NAFM) of a principal \napplicant who \nIs a temporary resident \n(TR) or who has made an \napplication for TR status \nor an application to \nremain in Canada as a TR  \nApplies for a PR visa or to \nremain in Canada as \npermanent resident \nIs a temporary \nresident (TR) or who \nhas made an \napplication for TR \nstatus or an \napplication to \nremain in Canada as \na TR \nApplies for a PR visa or to \nremain in Canada as \npermanent resident \n34, 35, 37 \nThe PA is inadmissible \nbecause the AFM is \ninadmissible \nThe PA is inadmissible \nbecause the AFM is \ninadmissible \nThe PA is \ninadmissible \nbecause the \nNAFM is \ninadmissible \nThe PA is inadmissible \nbecause the NAFM is \ninadmissible \n36, 38, 39, 40, \n40.1, 41 \nThe PA is not \ninadmissible because \nthe AFM is \ninadmissible \nThe PA is inadmissible if \nthe AFM is inadmissible \nThe PA is not \ninadmissible if the \nNAFM is \ninadmissible \nThe PA is inadmissible \nif the NAFM is \ninadmissible \n \n \nInadmissibility of the family member other than a protected person on the ground of \ninadmissible principal applicant (PA) \nInadmissibility \ngrounds of the \nsubject of an \nadmissibility \nhearing \nForeign national is an accompanying family \nmember (AFM) of a principal applicant who \nForeign national is a non-accompanying \nfamily member (NAFM) of a principal \napplicant who \nIs a temporary resident \n(TR) or who has made an \napplication for TR status \nor an application to \nremain in Canada as a TR  \nApplies for a PR visa or to \nremain in Canada as \npermanent resident \nIs a temporary \nresident (TR) or who \nhas made an \napplication for TR \nstatus or an \napplication to \nremain in Canada as \na TR \nApplies for a PR visa or to \nremain in Canada as \npermanent resident \n34, 35, 37 \nThe AFM is \ninadmissible because \nof the inadmissible PA \nThe AFM is inadmissible \nbecause of the \ninadmissible PA \nN/A1  \nN/A2 \n36, 38, 39, 40, \n40.1, 41 \nThe AFM is not \ninadmissible if the PA is \ninadmissible \nThe AFM is inadmissible \nbecause of the \ninadmissible PA \nN/A3 \nN/A4 \n                                                             \n1 In this scenario there is no need to examine the inadmissibility of the PA vis a vis the family members because in \nthis context the family member is non-accompanying, and is not coming to Canada. \n2 Same explanation as in footnote 1. \n3 Same explanation as in footnote 1. \n4 Same explanation as in footnote 1.\n2022-03-03 \n \n41 \n \nAn allegation of inadmissibility under section 42 of the Act cannot be made against permanent \nresidents or protected persons. \n10.11.1 Including family members at an admissibility hearing \nMost A42 inadmissibility cases are encountered overseas in the context of [temporary or \npermanent resident] visa applications and therefore never reach the ID. However, where the \nperson and their family members are in Canada, if a person is reported for inadmissibility under \nA34, A35 or A37, the matter will be subject to an admissibility hearing before the ID.  \nAn A44(1) report regarding the foreign national or permanent resident in question is sufficient \nand a separate report is not required for family members who are foreign nationals.  Note: In \ncases where a family member was not included in the BSF540, following the conclusion of the \nadmissibility hearing for the person alleged to be inadmissible under A34, A35 or A37, the \nfamily member can be the subject of their own A44(1) report alleging inadmissibility under \nA42(2), whereupon a Minister’s Delegate may issue them a deportation order pursuant to \nR228(1)(d). However, this process should only be undertaken if the officer was unable to notify \nthe family member, or was unaware of their presence at the time of completing the BSF540. For \nmore information on the review of A44(1) reports on family inadmissibility, refer to ENF 6. \n10.11.2 Evidence for inclusion of family members  \nTo include a family member in the removal order issued against the person concerned, hearings \nofficers must first prove the identity, citizenship and status of the family member. A42 provides \nthat only foreign nationals can be inadmissible on grounds of an inadmissible family member. \nTherefore, the hearings officer must clearly establish that the family member is a foreign \nnational. \nThe hearings officer must also prove that the conditions set forth in R227(2)(a) and (b) are \nsatisfied as follows: \nR227(2)(a) \nHearings officers should provide proof that family members were informed that they are the \nsubject of an admissibility hearing, have the right to make submissions as included in a copy of \nthe “Notice of Admissibility Hearing to Family Members” form (BSF 540) that was previously \nprovided to family members and have the right to be represented at their own expense at the \nadmissibility hearing. \nR227(2)(b) \nTo meet the condition in R227(2)(b), that the family members are subject to a decision of the \nImmigration Division that they are inadmissible under section 42 of the Act on grounds of the \ninadmissibility of the foreign national, it is sufficient to show that the family member meets the\n2022-03-03 \n \n42 \ndefinition of “family member” in R1(3). If 227(2)(a) and (b) are met then family members will \nautomatically be covered by the removal order made against the principal applicant. \nR1(3) provides that a foreign national’s “family members” are: \n(a) the spouse or common-law partner of the person;  \n(b)a dependent child of the person or of the person’s spouse or common-law partner; and  \n(c)a dependent child of a dependent child referred to in paragraph (b) \nThe term “common-law partner” is defined in R1(1). \nAfter the hearings officer has presented the evidence, affected family members are given an \nopportunity to establish the reasons for why they should not be included in the removal order of \nthe person concerned. \nFamily members can only avoid being included in the removal order of the person concerned if \nthey have proof that refutes the evidence submitted by the hearings officer and demonstrate that \nthey do not meet the definition of “family member” pursuant to R1(3). \nIf the ID comes to the conclusion that the foreign national is inadmissible, and that the conditions \nset forth in R227(2)(a) and (b) were met, then a removal order made by the ID against the person \nconcerned will automatically be effective against family members. \nSee ENF 2 for information on evidence regarding inadmissible family members. \n \n11 Preparing for an admissibility hearing: \nGeneral guidelines \n \n11.1 Minister’s obligation to disclose any relevant information or document (ID Rule 3)  \nWhen requesting an admissibility hearing, hearings officers have an obligation to provide to the \nID and the person concerned any relevant  information or document that is in the Minister’s \npossession, power or control. To comply with this disclosure obligation, the hearings officer is to \nseek out all relevant information in the immigration enforcement file. This includes making an \nenquiry into any files that may hold relevant information in systems to which the hearings officer \nhas access. \nIn addition to this general obligation, ID Rule 3 sets out a list of specific information that the \nBoard requires the Minister to provide.\n2022-03-03 \n \n43 \nTo meet these obligations, hearings officers should disclose the following documents: \n “Request for Admissibility Hearing” form (BSF 524); and \n “Notice of Admissibility Hearing” form (BSF 525); and  \n “Referral under subsection A44(2) of the IRPA for an admissibility hearing” form (BSF \n506); \n a copy of the A44(1) report that sets out the allegations;  \n all documents and information the Minister intends to introduce as evidence at the \nhearing; and  \n all other relevant document(s) or information whether or not it is being used to support \nthe Minister’s position. \nAll documents must comply with the requirements set out in the Immigration Division Rules 24 \nand 25 with respect to language and format. \nRule 3 of the ID Rules specifies that the hearings officer should file all relevant evidence at the \ntime that the hearing is requested. However, if not all evidence was filed at the time the hearing \nwas requested, ID Rule 26 requires that all documents be provided to the person concerned and \nthe ID at least five business days before the hearing. \nNote: In the case of an admissibility hearing of a detained individual, the first time the person is \nbrought before the ID (for the 48-hour detention review) it is possible that the admissibility \nhearing will be postponed at the request of counsel. It is recommended that hearings officers \norganize the evidence into two separate disclosure packages (one for the detention review and \none for the admissibility hearing), as each proceeding will follow a different schedule and may \nnot require the same disclosure.  \nNote: If the person concerned has retained counsel, the hearings officer will ensure that copies of \nthe relevant notices and documents are sent to counsel in accordance with Rule 28(3) of the ID \nRules. \nThe hearings officer should confirm that all information intended for the ID was sent to the \nregistry office, as indicated by a date stamp if delivered by hand. Should documents be sent by \nregular mail, they will be considered received seven days after the day it was mailed, refer to ID \nrules 27-31 for further information on how to provide a document. For the electronic \ntransmission of documents refer to your regional IRB registry office for information on how to \nsubmit documents electronically.  \n11.2 Additional allegations/amendments of the report \nWhen receiving a case file for preparation, the hearings officer’s first duty is to determine if the \ncase meets the technical, legal and factual requirements for presenting it to a member of the ID. \nDepending on the type of case, the hearings officer should verify the A44(1) report for accuracy \n(correct date, authorizations and signatures) and ensure that the allegations of fact and law are \ncorrectly stated.\n2022-03-03 \n \n44 \nAny errors or omissions in the report should be corrected. Minor errors or changes may be \naddressed by the hearings officer with a notification of an amendment, as long as appropriate \nprocedural fairness is extended to the person concerned. This may include the modification of \nthe remarks in the A44(1) report. In Uppal v. Canada, the Federal Court held that “an \namendment to the subsection 44(1) report, for the purpose of substituting a different Canadian \nequivalent offence, does not require that the report be returned to the Minister for a fresh \ndetermination”. In the case of substantive errors, the report should be returned to the MD who \nreviewed the report. If the original officer is no longer at the office where the decision was made \nor no longer performs the MD function, the request should be sent to a Manager for assignment \nand review. It may be necessary to make an application to the ID to request a postponement of \nthe admissibility hearing [ID Rules, Rule 43]. This is necessary only if the error or omission in \nthe A44(1) report or evidence cannot be rectified prior to the hearing date and would seriously \nimpact the presentation of the case by the hearings officer.  \nThe hearings officer must make sure that each of the essential components of the inadmissibility \nalleged in the report is supported by evidence, whether the evidence is documentary, or based on \ntestimony of the person concerned, or testimony from other witnesses.  \nIf the evidence is insufficient, the hearings officer may \n \ncomplete the file by adding additional evidence, if available; or \n \nwithdraw the application to hold the admissibility hearing. \n \nrefer the file back to CBSA investigations (or POE depending on the origin of the file) \nwith a request to obtain additional evidence. \nIf time permits, the hearings officer should make sure that the person concerned and the ID have \nbeen notified of changes made to the A44(1) report prior to the hearing. If time does not permit \ngiving advance notice of the changes made to the A44(1) report, the hearings officer must make \na preliminary statement at the hearing regarding the changes. If this is the case, the member of \nthe ID may confirm that the person concerned understands the nature of the changes. If \nnecessary, the member may grant an adjournment, to give the person concerned time to prepare. \nNote: In cases of removal orders based on an equivalency between a foreign law and Canadian \nlaw, the A44(1) report should include separate allegations for each possible Canadian \nequivalency that applies.  \n11.3 Including family members  \nWhen preparing a case, the hearings officer may discover that family members, who are foreign \nnationals and not protected persons in Canada, did not enter Canada at the same time as the \nperson concerned but are nonetheless present in Canada. In such cases it may be decided that, in \naccordance with A42(1) and A42(2),  these family members should be included in the removal \norder. If this is the case, an inland enforcement officer should prepare and serve a “Notice of \nAdmissibility Hearing to Family Members” form (BSF 540) on the family members to which \nA42(1) and A42(2) apply.\n2022-03-03 \n \n45 \nThis does not include family members who are permanent residents or protected persons. \nFor more information about family inadmissibility refer to section 10.11 above. \n11.4 Attending a pre-hearing conference \nThe ID may require the parties to participate in a pre-hearing conference to discuss issues, \nreview disclosure of information and the procedures to be followed in the case at hand. [ID \nRules, Rule 20(1)]. \nRule 20(3) of the ID Rules provides that the ID must state orally at the hearing or make a written \nrecord of any decisions or agreements made at the conference. It is important that all decisions or \nagreements made at the conference are clearly outlined in the hearings officer’s notes, as the \nparties at the hearing will be bound by them. \n11.5 Withdrawal of a request for an admissibility hearing \nID Rules, Rule 5 sets out when the Minister may withdraw a request for admissibility hearing. \nThe timing of the withdrawal is important: if no substantive evidence has been accepted, the \nhearings officer need only notify the ID of the withdrawal. This can be done orally at a \nproceeding or in writing. If the Minister notifies in writing, the Minister must provide a copy of \nthe notice to the other party [Rule 5(2) of the Immigration Division Rules]. However, once \nevidence has been accepted, a written application must be made to the ID. The ID will not grant \nthe withdrawal if doing so would be an abuse of process. ID Rule 5(1) states that an abuse of \nprocess is where the withdrawal would likely have a negative effect on the integrity of the ID. \nPrior to initiating a withdrawal, the hearings officer should discuss the case with their manager. \nIf the case involves an alleged inadmissibility under A34, hearings officers should be mindful \nthat the withdrawal of the report will automatically terminate, by operation of law, the prescribed \nconditions of release imposed on the person concerned as per R250.1(a)-(k). \n12 Presenting the case \n12.1 Admissibility hearing opening format  \nAlthough the precise structure of admissibility hearings may vary from one member of the ID to \nanother, the hearings officer can expect that the following will be the general format at the \nopening of the hearing: \n \nThe member of the ID makes an opening statement, indicating the legal basis for the \nhearing, the place of the hearing, the date of the hearing and the jurisdiction. The member \nwill then ask the parties and their counsel to identify themselves. The member of the ID \nwill also note the presence of any observers present. The member will exclude members \nof the public, if the admissibility hearing concerns a refugee protection claimant or if the \nhearing is determined to be held “in camera.”\n2022-03-03 \n \n46 \n \nNext, the member of the ID confirms that the person concerned understands and \ncommunicates in the official language in which the admissibility hearing is being held. If \nan interpreter is necessary, the member ensures that there is effective communication \nbetween the interpreter and the person concerned.  \n \nIf the person concerned is not represented by counsel, the member of the ID will confirm \nthat the person concerned was made aware of his or her right to counsel. If the PC does \nnot have counsel, the ID may decide to adjourn and set another date to allow the PC to \nobtain counsel, depending on the circumstances \n \nIn the case of an admissibility hearing with respect to a foreign national, the member of \nthe ID may ask if family members will be affected by a removal order in accordance with \nR227(2). If family members are affected, the hearings officer should ensure that they \nwere named in the BSF524 and submit the “Notice of Admissibility Hearing to Family \nMembers” form (BSF 540) that was prepared by the IEO and provided to the family \nmembers prior to the hearing. \n \nThe member of the ID will explain to the person concerned the reason for the hearing, the \nallegations, possible consequences and procedures that will be followed during the \nhearing. \n12.2 Exclusion of witnesses \nThe member asks counsel and the hearings officer if there are any witnesses who will testify at \nthe hearing present in the room. If so, the member will ask the witnesses to leave the room. Such \na request applies to all the witnesses present in the room, except for the person concerned and the \nexpert witnesses. The person concerned has the right to attend the admissibility hearing that \nconcerns them. Hearings officers may wish for expert witnesses to hear all evidence presented \nsince their testimony must be based on the evidence that has been presented during the hearing. \nThe member may also remind everyone that witnesses must refrain from discussing the contents \nof their testimony outside the hearing room until all testimony is concluded. [Immigration \nDivision Rules, Rule 36]. \n12.3 Evidence \nBefore the hearing, the hearings officer should ensure that the Minister’s evidence found in the \nMinister’s disclosure, or otherwise expected to be provided by any witnesses, will substantiate \nthe allegations contained in the A44(1) report. The Minister must always include the A44(1) \nreport and A44(2) referral in the Minister’s disclosure. The hearings officer should bring the \noriginal of the A44(1) report and the A44(2) referral to the hearing as the member of the ID may \nask to see the originals. \nAt the hearing, the member of the ID accepts admissible documents provided by both parties and \nenters them as exhibits to the hearing. The hearings officer must ensure that all of the Minister’s \ndisclosure is entered as an exhibit(s), however, the ID has the jurisdiction to decide whether to \nenter the evidence as an exhibit.\n2022-03-03 \n \n47 \nIf applicable, the hearings officer calls the person concerned as a witness and may call other \nwitnesses as required to support the allegations outlined in the A44(1) report. The hearings \nofficer can examine or question these witnesses on the allegation and on any of the evidence \nfound in the exhibits. \nThe person concerned (or counsel representing the person concerned) will be given the \nopportunity to present evidence to refute the allegations contained in the A44(1) report and to \ncross-examine all witnesses.  \nThe hearings officer is given the opportunity to cross-examine on the evidence presented by the \nperson concerned (or by counsel representing the person concerned).  \nIf evidence that has not been previously provided to all parties arises during cross-examination, \nthe opposing party will be given an opportunity to examine this evidence and respond \naccordingly which may include calling additional witnesses to refute this new evidence. It may \nbe appropriate to request an adjournment to review the evidence in order to provide a proper \nresponse. \n12.4 Evidence on the identity, citizenship and status of the person concerned \nAfter the person concerned has been sworn in as a witness, the person’s identity, citizenship and \nstatus in Canada must be clearly established. The hearings officer may develop the evidence by \nasking questions such as: \n \nWhat is your correct name in full? (to establish identity) \n \nHave you ever used any other name? (to establish identity) \n \nWhat is your date of birth? (to establish identity) \n \nWhere were you born? (to establish identity and possibly citizenship) \n \nOf what country are you a citizen? (to establish citizenship) \n \nAre you a Canadian citizen? (to clarify that this person is not a Canadian and therefore \nsubject to the IRPA inadmissibility provisions) \n \nAre you a person registered as an Indian under the Indian Act? (to clarify that the person \nis subject to the IRPA inadmissibility provisions)  \n \nAre you a permanent resident of Canada? (to determine burden of proof and applicability \nof certain provisions) \n \nDo you have a passport?  \n \nDo you have other identity documents?  \n12.5 Submissions on the allegations  \nAfter the hearings officer and the person concerned have introduced all the evidence, the \nmember of the ID gives both parties an opportunity to make submissions on the allegations. The \npresentation of submissions on the evidence should be clear, concise and delivered in logical \norder. The submission stage is not the time to introduce new facts. Hearings officers should also \nensure that any statements and conclusions made in their submission are supported by evidence\n2022-03-03 \n \n48 \nentered into the record. For example, in the case of a person seeking admission to Canada, the \nhearings officer may indicate in his/her submissions that the person concerned: \n \nhas no right to enter Canada since the person is neither a Canadian citizen nor a \npermanent resident of Canada; and \n \nhas not discharged the burden of proof and has therefore failed to establish admissibility. \nIn the case of a foreign national who is in Canada, the hearings officer should point out that the \nperson concerned has no right to remain in Canada given that they are neither a Canadian citizen \nnor a permanent resident of Canada. The hearings officer may present a summary of the evidence \nthat would lead a reasonable and cautious person to conclude that there is a factual basis to the \nallegation(s) contained in the A44(1) report. \nIt is not sufficient to merely include the evidence in the disclosure package. It the responsibility \nof the hearings to highlight the specific page and passage in which the evidence can be found. In \nPiber v. MCI 2001 FCT 769, the Federal Court has held that it is not incumbent on the Board to \ncomb through a party’s extensive disclosure package; the onus falls on the Minister to highlight \nthe relevant references to show how each of the elements of the allegation is proved by the \nevidence. \n12.6 The admissibility decision \nFollowing submissions, the member of the ID renders a decision as to whether or not the person \nconcerned is inadmissible to Canada. The decision determines if the Minister has met the \nstandard of proof with the evidence introduced into the record, and whether the allegations \ncontained in the report are well founded. The member shall then render one of the decisions \nlisted in A45 as follows: \n \nIf the ID finds that the person concerned is in fact a Canadian citizen, a permanent \nresident, or a registered Indian under the Indian Act, the ID will recognize the person’s \nright to enter Canada [A45(a)].  \n \nIf the ID finds that the person concerned is not inadmissible, and is satisfied that the \nperson meets the requirements of the Act, the ID will grant the person concerned \ntemporary or permanent resident status [A45(b)], as the case may be. \n \nIf the ID finds that the person concerned is not inadmissible, but that the evidence does \nnot show that the person concerned meets all of the requirements of the Act, then the ID \nshall authorize the person concerned to enter Canada for further examination, with or \nwithout conditions [A45(c)]. \n \nIf the ID finds that the allegation is well founded, the ID shall make the applicable \nremoval order [A45(d)]. \nThe ID must give the reasons for its decision orally or in writing. The ID will provide the written \nreasons upon request from one of the parties, which must be received by the Division within 10 \ndays from the notification of the decision [ID Rules, Rule 7(4)].\n2022-03-03 \n \n49 \n12.7 Issuing the removal order  \nWhere, at the conclusion of an admissibility hearing, the member of the ID is of the opinion that \nthe person concerned is inadmissible on one or more grounds, the member shall make the \napplicable removal order [A45(d)].  \nR229(1) lists the type of removal order to be made by the ID according to applicable \ninadmissibility. \nR229(2) lists grounds of inadmissibility for which the ID must make a departure order when the \nperson concerned is a claimant for refugee protection [R229(1)(f), (g), (j),(m) and (n)].  \nTo ensure that the correct removal order is issued, the hearings officer should state whether the \neligibility of the refugee claim has been determined, and if the claim has been determined to be \nineligible, produce copies of all relevant forms.  \nWhen an application for refugee protection is presented before or during the admissibility \nhearing, the hearings officer must proceed as if the eligibility determination has already been \nmade.  \nR229(3) lists circumstances in which the ID shall make a deportation order against a person \ninstead of the prescribed removal order pursuant to R229(1). The circumstances listed in R229(3) \nare the following: \n1. the person was previously subject to a removal order and the person is \ninadmissible on the same grounds as in that order (R229(3)(a)); \n2. the person has failed to comply with any condition or obligation imposed under \nthe Act or the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, unless the failure is the basis \nfor the removal order (R229(3)(b)); or \n3. the person has been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament \npunishable by way of indictment or of two offences under any Act of Parliament \nnot arising out of a single occurrence, unless the conviction or convictions are the \ngrounds for the removal order (R229(3)(c)). \nHearings officers should have provided in the Minister’s disclosure all relevant evidence to \nsupport the application of R229(3). \nNote: For more information on specified removal orders, see ENF 10, Removals. \n12.8 Cases involving refugee protection claimants \nIf the person concerned claims refugee protection during an admissibility hearing, the case must \nbe referred to a Minister's delegate for determination of eligibility.  \nThe person concerned will be issued a Determination of Eligibility form (IMM 1442B), which \nwill provide reasons, if the claim is ineligible.\n2022-03-03 \n \n50 \nWhere an application for refugee protection is presented before or during the proceedings, the \nhearings officer must proceed as if the person is eligible to make a claim for refugee protection. \nThis means that the admissibility hearing must be held in private from the moment the \napplication for refugee protection is made unless the ID decides the hold the hearing in public on \nan exceptional basis as per A166(d).,. If it is later determined that the claim for refugee \nprotection was not eligible, the continuation of an adjourned admissibility hearing and \nsubsequent hearings shall be held in public. \n12.9 Claim to Canadian citizenship \nAn admissibility hearing is not generally adjourned simply because the person concerned claims \nto be a Canadian citizen. Since Canadian citizenship is purely a creation of federal statute (refer \nto section 3 of the Citizenship Act which exhaustively defines who is a Canadian citizen and who \ncan become one), it is the law which gives the person status and not a document. In general, \nthere are three basic pathways to citizenship: birth in Canada (unless born to a diplomat); birth \nabroad in the 1st generation to a Canadian parent (gestational or biological link or legal \nparentage); and by grant of citizenship. While most citizens do not carry a citizenship certificate \nto prove they are Canadian, they will have a Canadian passport or provincial or territorial birth \ncertificate as proof of Canadian citizenship. For other Canadians, a citizenship certificate issued \nby IRCC will constitute proof of status. It is the responsibility of the member of the ID to \ndetermine if the evidence produced by the person concerned is sufficient to support the claim \nthat they are Canadian citizen. \nThe hearings officer may challenge the claim to citizenship during the hearing, if the hearings \nofficer is in possession of evidence to support the challenge. The hearings officer may ask the \nmember of the ID to render a decision and continue the admissibility hearing according to \nestablished procedure. The hearings officer may request an adjournment in order to obtain the \nevidence required to refute the claim to Canadian citizenship, if the necessary evidence is not \nreadily available. In this respect, the hearings officer may wish to consult with the Registrar of \nCanadian Citizenship, or another citizenship official in IRCC to assist in this citizenship status \ndetermination pursuant to the information sharing arrangement between IRCC-CBSA, since this \nmay help to refute the person’s claim, or alternatively, may result in finding support for it. \nIf the admissibility hearing is adjourned pending proof of an application for a Canadian \nCitizenship Certificate, the applicant should be given a reasonable amount of time, the person \nconcerned must provide proof that he or she has made an application for a citizenship certificate. \nIf an application for a citizenship certificate has not been filed within the specified period, or if \nthe hearings officer is informed by the Registrar of Canadian Citizenship (RCC) that a \ncitizenship certificate will not be issued, the hearings officer will request the ID to resume the \nadmissibility hearing. \nIf the RCC confirms that the person concerned is indeed a Canadian citizen or issues a certificate \nof citizenship, the hearings officer will forward the documents to the ID and the admissibility \nhearing will be concluded immediately.\n2022-03-03 \n \n51 \n12.10 Cases involving detainees \nAdmissibility hearings concerning persons who are detained may coincide with the date \nscheduled for a detention review. Although the admissibility hearing may be adjourned, the \ndetention review must take place within the time frames prescribed by section A57.  \nIf the admissibility hearing takes place, the member of the ID may proceed first with the \nadmissibility hearing. Since the admissibility hearing and the detention review are two separate \nproceedings, the member may ask for separate disclosure packages for each proceeding. \nFor more information, see section 14, Detention reviews.  \n \n13. Carrying out a decision of the \nImmigration Division  \nMost often, member of the ID will give their decision and reasons at the conclusion of the \nhearing. However, in more complex cases, for instance where a substantial volume of evidence \nhas been entered, the member may reserve their decision and provide their decision in writing. If \nthe hearings officer proceeded by way of written submissions, the member’s decision is usually \nmade in writing, although the member could call another hearing date to render a decision orally. \nIn all cases, the hearings officer or other staff in the hearings office must ensure that the \nMinister’s copy of the removal order is placed on file, that the case details are updated in NCMS \nand GCMS and that the case file is given to the appropriate unit for action (removals unit for \nremoval, for the storage room where the case is closed with no further enforcement actions \nrequired).  \nWhere time permits, results of the admissibility hearing should be provided to the officers who \nprepared and reviewed the original report, or who arrested and detained the permanent resident \nor the foreign national under the provisions of IRPA. Also where time permits, for training \npurposes, hearings officers should provide feedback on the effectiveness of the work conducted \nby those involved in the specific case. \n13.1 Recourse in case of ‘favorable decision’ by the Member (finding the person not to \nbe inadmissible) \n \nPerson found ‘not described’ under section  \nDelegated authority to file a Minister’s appeal at the IAD \nA34, A35, A37 \nCBSA Litigation management Unit \nA36, A38, A39, A40, A40.1, A41 and A42 \nIRCC Litigation management Division\n2022-03-03 \n \n52 \n \n13.1.1 Minister’s appeal at the IAD \n \nWhere hearings officers are of the opinion that there are, or may be, grounds to appeal a decision \nby the member finding the person not described under A34, A35 or A37, they will consult with \ntheir manager, who will then contact the Litigation Management Unit (LMU) (litigation-\nmanagement@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) for guidance. The decision to appeal an ID decision to the IAD \nis made by persons with delegated authority from the Minister. \n \nIn the case of hearings where the Member found the person not described under A36, A38, A39, \nA40, A40.1, A41 or A42, the delegated authority from the Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration rests with IRCC’s Litigation Management Division (LMD). After concurrence from \ntheir manager, the Justice Liaison Officer (JLO) will reach out to LMD \n(IRCC.CMBLitigationMgmtRequest-DemandeGestLitigesDGRC.IRCC@cic.gc.ca) for \nguidance. \nSee ENF19, sec. 13, for more information on the procedure for Minister’s appeals \n \n13.1.2 Application for leave for judicial review  \nWhere hearings officers are of the opinion that there are, or may be, grounds to seek judicial \nreview, hearings officers will consult with their manager. If the manager concurs, the hearings \nofficer will, within five business days, send a report which summarizes the case, details the error \nof fact, law or mixed law and fact and the rationale for seeking judicial review to the regional \nJLO. If the JLO is not available, the hearings officer may send the report directly to LMU at \nNHQ (litigation-management@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) or LMD (IRCC.CMBLitigationMgmtRequest-\nDemandeGestLitigesDGRC.IRCC@cic.gc.ca based on which Minister is responsible as laid out \nin sec 13.1.1 above. \nThe report is to be transmitted by email. It is imperative that a copy of the written reasons of the \ndecision in question, when received, is forwarded to LMU or LMD as expeditiously as possible. \nThis will allow sufficient time for review and the necessary consultations. This will also allow \nlitigation management (LMU or LMD) to give appropriate instructions to the Department of \nJustice (DOJ) and to give the DOJ time to prepare applications to seek leave for judicial review.  \nSee ENF 9, Judicial Review, for more information. \nNote: Officers should keep in mind that PKI-encrypted emails should only be used to transmit \ninformation up to the ‘Protected B’ level. If the case contains information with a higher \nclassification level, refer to the CBSA Security volume for guidance on alternative secure \ncommunications systems and coordinate with LMU.\n2022-03-03 \n \n53 \n13.2 Prosecutions of serious violations of IRPA \n \nIt is the CBSA’s policy to refer cases involving serious violations of IRPA to the Royal Canadian \nMounted Police (RCMP) or the Criminal Investigations Section of the CBSA, where appropriate, \nfor further investigation and prosecution. The hearings manager or chief, as the case may be, \ndecides if a case should be referred to the RCMP following a debrief from the officer on the \nreasons why this case should be brought to the attention of the RCMP in accordance with the \nguidelines set out in IRPA for the offences under A117-A119, A122, A124, A126 and A127.\n2022-03-03 \n \n54 \n14 Procedures - detention reviews \n14.1 General  \nA detention review is a proceeding that takes place before a member of the ID during which the \ncircumstances of detention are examined to determine: \n \nwhether the detention is lawful; and if it is, \n \nwhether detention should be continued. \nAt these proceedings, the Minister of Public Safety is represented by a hearings officer. A \ndetention review: \n \nis not as structured as an admissibility hearing; \n \nmay be held on its own or in conjunction with an admissibility hearing (one after the \nother); \n \nevidence needs to be presented to support a position for continued detention;  \n \ndetained persons have the right to be represented by counsel. \nA58(1) sets out that “the Immigration Division shall order the release of a permanent resident or \na foreign national unless it is satisfied, taking into account prescribed factors, that [grounds for \ndetention are present].”  This means that the burden of proof rests with the Minister to establish, \non a balance of probabilities that the person should remain in detention. \nGenerally, each party (the hearings officer and the person concerned) presents evidence and \nmakes arguments. Evidence may consist of witness testimony, documents or other objects. \nEvidence presented at detention reviews is governed by the same evidentiary rules as at \nadmissibility hearings.(see Appendix A)  The member of the ID should be aware of the alleged \nreasons for detention from the information contained in the Request for Admissibility \nHearing/Detention Review Pursuant to the Immigration Division Rules form (BSF 524). The ID \nmember will require that the hearings officer present the reasons for initial detention.  \nFollowing the hearings officer’s opening statement, the ID member provides an overview of the \npurpose of the detention review and the jurisdiction conferred upon the member by IRPA and its \nRegulations. The member will ask the hearings officer to submit the facts as the Minister sees \nthem based on the evidence, any legal arguments, and a recommendation regarding the \ncontinuation of the detention as to whether detention should be continued, there are any viable \nalternatives to detention, or if the PC should be released. If the hearings officer recommends \nrelease, the hearings officer should specify the conditions of release that the Minister would like \nto have imposed. Before a hearings officer presents the position of the Minister, officers should \nkeep in mind that detention is a measure of last resort, and that the wording of A58(1) is that  the \n‘The Immigration Division shall order the release…’, therefore release is the default position \nbefore considerations\n2022-03-03 \n \n55 \n14.1.1 Authority to detain a person under IRPA and release them prior to the first \ndetention review \nFor detailed information on the authority to detain a person (A55), as well as the authority to \nrelease prior to the first detention review before the ID (A56), refer to ENF 20 : Detention.  \n14.1.2 Detention review – timeline for permanent residents and foreign nationals  \nThe frequency of detention reviews is prescribed in A57 as follows:  \n \nA57(1) provides that the ID must review the reasons for continued detention within 48 \nhours after the permanent resident or foreign national was detained; \n \nA57(2) provides that the ID must review the reasons for continued detention at least once \nduring the 7 days following the initial review; \n \nA57(2) also provides that the ID must review the reasons for continued detention at least \nonce during each 30-day period following each previous review. \nNote: A57.1 stipulates a different frequency for detention reviews to those detainees who have \nbeen designated as “designated foreign nationals (DFN). Refer to section 14.3.1 for more \ninformation on cases involving designated foreign nationals. \nThe detained person will be present at each detention review, either in person or by way of video \nor teleconference, unless they choose not to participate (something that happens very rarely).  \n14.1.3 Mechanism of detention reviews and grounds for continued detention \nDetention reviews are a two-step process: \n1. Release: The member of the ID must release a person from detention, unless the member \nis satisfied that one of the reasons described in A58(1) exists, taking into account the \nprescribed factors (R244-R247) as appropriate.  \n2. Detention: If the member determines that one or more grounds for detention exists, the \nmember considers the factors in R248 to determine if detention should be continued.  \nIn Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Thanabalasingham (paragraph 24), the \nFederal Court of Appeal noted that detention reviews are not technically de novo hearings but \nthat the ID must come to a fresh conclusion whether detention should continue. The ID member \nmust give clear and compelling reasons to depart from prior decisions to detain.  \nIt is the hearing officer’s role to make recommendations, in favour of or against continued \ndetention. In doing so, hearings officers should be guided by the factors set out in R245 to R248 \ndepending on the reason for detention.  The member of the ID will verify, consider and weigh \neach of the factors set out in the Regulations.\n2022-03-03 \n \n56 \nFor example, if the hearings officer seeks detention because the person concerned is alleged to be \na danger to the public, the hearings officer will have to provide evidence to demonstrate that the \nfacts of the case fall within the factors listed in R246. \nThe list of factors set out in each of R245, R246, and R247 is not exhaustive and other factors \nmay be considered by the member of the ID when rendering a decision. Thus the credibility of \nthe person concerned and statements of the person concerned that they will or will not comply \nwith the laws governing immigration and refugee protection or any directive issued by the CBSA \nmay be considered in the assessment of the grounds for detention. \nIt is however insufficient for the hearings officer to present evidence exclusively in support of \nthe grounds for detention. Hearings officers should clearly articulate which alternatives to \ndetention (ATDs) were considered for the person, but rejected or deemed unsuitable for the case \nat hand. They should be prepared to answer questions by the member on why the ATDs do not \nsufficiently mitigate the risk. For further information on ATD’s refer to ENF34 Alternatives to \ndetention \nFor additional information on reasons for detention, refer to ENF 20  Detention. \nNote: It is not required that continued detention be sought on the same ground(s) as the original \nreason for arrest and detention. Hearings officers may argue for continued detention under A58 \non grounds that may or may not have existed at the time of initial arrest and detention. \n1.Flight Risk (R245) \nFor the purposes of R244(a), the factors to be considered in determining if a person is unlikely to \nappear for examination, an admissibility hearing, removal from Canada or at a proceeding that \ncould lead to the making of a removal order by the Minister under A44(2) of the Act are \nprescribed in  R245. \nIn addition to the factors set out in R245, hearings officers may consider the following when \npreparing a submission to indicate that the person concerned is not likely to appear: \n \nuse of pseudonym(s)/alias(es) to avoid detection or to evade compliance with IRPA and \nits Regulations; \n \nfrequent changes of address in Canada; \n \npreviously eluded examination or did not appear as requested;  \n \nhas not complied with previous conditions attached or the conditions to a bond imposed \nby a criminal court, the CBSA or the IRB as well as the severity of the non-compliance; \n \nattempted to escape or to hide; and \n \na warrant was issued against the person concerned. \nIn cases where hearings officers perceive a risk that the person concerned will not appear unless \nconditions are imposed, hearings officers should consider a cash deposit and/or guarantee with \nconditions of release [A44(3)]. For additional information on deposits and guarantees, refer to \nENF 8\n2022-03-03 \n \n57 \nThe member of the ID will consider and weigh all available evidence and ATDs when deciding \nif continued detention is warranted. It will also consider particular circumstances such has mental \nillness, addiction or other vulnerabilities, which may play a role in the non-compliance, and how \nthe person is addressing those issues, such as considering any re-habilitation plans or placement \nin recovery rehabilitation facilities as ATD \n2. Danger to the public (R246)  \nFor the purposes of R244(b), the factors to be considered in determining if a person is a danger \nto the public are prescribed in R246. the ID relies on the objectives of the Act, including \n3(2)(g)&(h)  — “to protect public health and safety and maintain the security of Canadian \nsociety” and “to promote international justice and security by denying access to Canadian \nterritory to persons, including refugee claimants, who are security risks or serious criminals” — \nto interpret the grounds of ‘danger to the public.’ \nAll the facts and circumstances specific to each cases are relevant to support a continued \ndetention or not. They should be considered carefully and submitted to the ID to appreciate the \nlevel of danger that the person concerned may pose.  \nAs such, some factors may require additional arguments to demonstrate that a specific fact \ndisclosed before the ID should be considered as a factor in favour of continued detention. For \nexample, the details of a foreign conviction for a sexual offence [R246(f)(i)] should be examined \ncarefully to determine the equivalent in Canadian law. The hearings officer should disclose all \navailable details to satisfy the member of the ID that the offence is described in R246(f)(i). \nThe circumstances surrounding the commission of an offence may assist the member of the ID in \ndetermining the weight of a factor compared to another. For instance, the fact that the victim of \nthe offence is a minor child may be considered as more serious than if the victim is not a minor. \nAn offence committed with the use of a prohibited weapon may also be considered to have more \nweight than an offence committed with another weapon, depending on the specific circumstances \nof each case. \nNote: In Bruzzese v Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 2014 FC \n230 (paragraphs 47 and 87) the Federal Court stated that each and every one of the factors listed \nin R246 is a sufficient ground to find that a person is a danger to the public and that these factors \nmay serve as a sufficient basis, in and of themselves, to find that a person is a danger to the \npublic. Each of these, the Court held, is an indicator that a person is, at least prima facie, a \ndanger to the public. Once the Minister has made out such a prima facie case, the burden shifts \non the person detained to lead evidence as to show that he or she is not a danger to the public . \nHearings officers should submit the following documents, if applicable and available, to the ID \nto support an argument that an individual is a danger to the public: \n \nthe criminal record of the person concerned, and documents establishing a criminal \nconviction in or outside Canada; \n \nthe indictment;\n2022-03-03 \n \n58 \n \nevidence of the medical condition of the person concerned;  \n \npolice reports documenting association of the person concerned with known criminals or \na criminal organization, even if that person has no criminal convictions \n \nclassified reports relating to security or criminal activity of the person concerned, and a \nrecord of physical violence, if applicable; \n \nCorrectional Services report on the person’s behavior in detention; and \n \nreport from the Parole Board of Canada, or from a provincial parole board. \nA Minister’s Opinion that the person constitutes a danger to the public under A115(2)(a) does \nnot in itself constitute a finding that the person is a danger to the public in the context of a \ndetention review before the ID. \nIn addition, hearings officers may consider the age of a conviction, the circumstance under which \nan offence was committed and any events which have transpired since. An assessment of danger \nto the public is forward-looking. Events of the past are, by necessity, all we have to make an \neducated guess on how an individual may behave in the future. The fact that a number of years \nhave passed or the fact that the person has served their sentence do not on their own indicate that \nthe person concerned is or is not a danger to the public. What is required is some evidence that \nthe person is rehabilitated. A strong indication that the person concerned is a danger to the public \nmay consist of evidence that the offence involved violence or weapons and that the person \nconcerned is likely to re-offend. \nThe member of the ID will consider and weigh all available evidence when deciding if detention \nshould be continued. They will also consider if the circumstances leading to a finding of danger \ninvolved a heightened level of vulnerability due to addiction or mental health issues and whether \nthose have been mitigated. \nNote: See ENF 28, Ministerial Opinions on Danger to the Public and to the Security of Canada, \nfor additional information on assessing danger to the public. \n3. Identity (R247) \nFor the purposes of R244(c), the factors to be considered in determining whether a person is a \nforeign national whose identity has not been established are prescribed in section R247. \nIn cases where the identity of the person concerned has not been established, the hearings officer \nmust provide details of the efforts made to establish the identity of the person concerned. The \nofficer should be ready to provide concrete plans and time estimates for these efforts. . \nIf applicable, the hearings officer must demonstrate how the person concerned has not \nreasonably cooperated for the purpose of establishing his or her identity [A58(1)(d); ID Rules, \nRule 247].  \nHearings officers should ensure that the case file contains a signed and dated “Minister’s \nOpinion Regarding the Foreign National’s Identity” (BSF 510) form.\n2022-03-03 \n \n59 \nNote: In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Bains (paragraph 4), the Federal \nCourt clarified that it is not up to the member of the ID to determine what is acceptable as proof \nof identity, but merely whether the Minister made reasonable efforts to identify the person \nconcerned. [see also Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. B046]  \nThe factors set out in R245, R246 and R247 are not exhaustive. Additional factors may be \nconsidered by the member of the ID when assessing the evidence.  \nThe member of the ID will consider and weigh all available evidence when deciding if detention \nshould be continued (R248).  \n14.1.4 Factors to be considered when determining if detention should be continued \n(R248) \nIn addition to the factors referred to above, members of the ID must take into consideration the \nfactors set out in R248, also known as the ‘Sahin factors’ when determining if detention should \nbe continued. Even where the Minister established a prima facie basis for continued detention on \none of the A58(1) grounds and prescribed factors of A244-R247, the ID still must consider the \nfactors listed in R248 before deciding whether to order detention or release.  \nIn Sahin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), the Federal Court determined that \nin certain cases indefinite detention violates Section 7 of the Charter. Bektas Sahin, the person \nconcerned had been detained for more than 14 months at the time the Federal Court rendered its \ndecision. The Court provided a list of considerations that should be taken into account by \nmembers of the ID when making decisions on whether an individual should remain in detention. \nThese considerations have been codified in R248. \nAlso refer to Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), which endorsed Sahin. \nIf the hearings officer recommends continued detention, the hearings officer should submit all \navailable evidence to the ID in support of continued detention. \nThe factors set out in R248 are as follows: \n \nReasons for detention R248(a) \nFor example, there may be a stronger case for continued detention on the grounds that the \nperson concerned is a danger to the public. \nLength of time in detention R248(b) and length of time detention will likely continue \nR248(c)  \nIn Sahin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), the Federal Court \ndetermined that, in certain cases, indefinite detention violated section 7 of the Charter.\n2022-03-03 \n \n60 \nOne of the significant tests set out by the Federal Court related to the period of time that \nhad passed before a decision was rendered as to whether the person in question was \nauthorized to remain in Canada. \nIn Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Li (para. 81),the FCA stated that \n“the basis of the estimation of anticipated future length of detention should be the \nproceedings as they exist at the time of each monthly review and not on an anticipation of \navailable processes but not yet underway.” [underlining added] \nHearings officers should be aware that, as the detention progresses and surrounding \ncircumstances evolve, some processes such as a positive—Stage 1 application for \npermanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, or the implementation \nof a Temporary Stay of Removal (TSR) may significantly prolong the expected time of \ncontinued detention when dealing with someone who is being detained for removal. The \nofficer should reassess in light of the evolving situation, whether continued detention is \nappropriate; if so, the extent to which the evidence available on file can counterbalance \nthe Member’s weighing of R248(c), taking into account the expected duration of \ncontinued detention. In their submissions, hearings officers must establish that the person \nis not facing indefinite detention due to an unachievable immigration outcome with \nevidence.  \nHowever, in exceptional cases immigration detention could still continue where there is \nno foreseeable possibility of removal (positive risks) where the person is a danger to the \npublic, in order to ensure a proper alternative to detention is secured, see Taino 2020 FC \n427.  \nAs noted at para 86: the Member could and should have simply ruled on whether to \ncontinue the detention or to release on the basis of the toolkit provided to her by the \nstatute, namely section 248 of the Regulations, rather than predetermining it with a \nCharter analysis. Certainly, Charter considerations could have been used to consider \naspects such as the length of time in detention but, as Sahin and other cases have held \nsince, the section 248 factors comply with the demands of section 7.  \n For additional information on impediments to removal, please refer to ENF 10, sec. 11. \nIt is important to recognize that the risk a person poses as a flight risk or danger to the \npublic does not decrease or disappear just because the person undergoes a prolonged stay \nin detention. Hearings officers should be prepared to present evidence to show that \nalthough the person concerned has spent a lengthy period of time in detention, the risk \nthey pose remains unchanged.  \n \nAny unexplained delays or unexplained lack of diligence by the person concerned or \nby the CBSA R248(d)\n2022-03-03 \n \n61 \nIf the person concerned or the Minister has caused any unexplained delays or if either of \nthem has not been as diligent as is reasonably possible, it should weigh against the \noffending party. \nFor example, in a subsequent court decision, Kidane v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship \nand Immigration) (paragraphs 8 and 9), the Federal Court upheld the member’s decision \nto detain the person concerned, ruling that the member had adequately applied the four-\npart test set out in Sahin, and that prolonged detention of the person concerned did not \nviolate his rights as he was largely himself responsible for the procedural delays that \ncaused the continuation of his detention. \nIn Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Kamail (paragraphs 34 and 37), \nthe Federal Court applied the four-part test set out in Sahin and concluded that the test \n“clearly favours keeping the respondent in detention”. The member committed an error in \nlaw when he decided the case in the respondent’s favour on the basis that detention was \nindefinite when he recognized that the detained person’s lack of cooperation must count \nagainst that person and not the Minister. \n \nThe existence of alternatives to detention R248(e) \nWhen assessing continued detention of a person concerned, members of the ID consider \nthe availability, effectiveness and appropriateness of ATDs, including but not limited to \noutright release, a bond or guarantee, periodic in-person reporting, voice reporting, \nelectronic monitoring, confinement to a particular location or geographic area, the \nrequirement to report changes to contact information or a form of detention that is less \nrestrictive to the individual, etc. \nEven if no ATDs are proposed by either the Minister, or counsel, it is important that the \nhearings officer anticipate the matter of ATDs and their suitability or unsuitability (if \napplicable), as they will be addressed by the member. For additional information on ATD \nassessment at detention reviews, please refer to ENF 34. \nNote: Members are not limited to the considerations in the factors above when deciding if \ncontinued detention of a person concerned is warranted.  \nIn practice, these “other factors” mean that the Immigration Division may order release even if \nsatisfied that the Minister has established a prima facie basis for continued detention under \ns.58(1) or (2).  For example, the Immigration Division may order release because detention has \ncontinued for an extremely long time with no realistic prospect of removal, or the Immigration \nDivision may order release because the Minister is unable to explain a lack of diligence in taking \nsteps to establish identity.  Alternatively, the Immigration Division may order release because it \nis satisfied that alternatives to detention – such as release on conditions – would adequately \naddress the concerns underlying the grounds for detention. \n  \nWhile these “other factors” are enumerated in s.248 of the Regulations, the Supreme Court of \nCanada held that these same factors must be examined in all cases of prolonged or lengthy\n2022-03-03 \n \n62 \nimmigration detention in order to ensure the detention reviews are meaningful and consistent \nwith Charter requirements5. \n \n14.2 Preparing for a detention review: General guidelines \n \n14.2.1 Disclosure of documents  \nWhen preparing for their disclosure, hearings officers should be cognizant of their obligations to \nthe ID.  Previously, the Minister was responsible for disclosing any information they intended to \nrely on during a detention review. On April 1, 2019 the ID updated it’s Chairperson’s guidelines \nfor detention which shifts the disclosure obligations to include all relevant information in \nCBSA’s possession. (Rule 7.3.4 - The Minister is expected to disclose all relevant evidence, \nwhether or not it is exculpatory or they intend to rely on it prior to the hearing.   \nThe FCA in Brown v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FCA 130  at para 142-143 & \n145 re-affirms the Chairperson’s guidelines in that the Minister must disclose to the detainee all \ninformation relevant to their detention review that is not subject to a valid claim of privilege. \nThis includes information advantageous to the detainee, information regarding the grounds for \nthe detention, information pertaining to R248 factors, the existence of immigration nexus, and \nthe information that bears on whether continued detention is warranted and consistent with the \nCharter and administrative law principles. This disclosure requirement is not unlimited; it is \ntempered by the requirement that the information be relevant to the detention review of the \nparticular detainee. It is recommended that documents be ordered in a logical fashion, be it \nchronological or thematic. See ENF 31 for more details on disclosure obligations. \nThe ID Rules, Rule 24 requires that each document should be numbered consecutively and \nwhere more than one document is provided, a list of documents and their corresponding page \nnumbers is also required. \nHearings officers must disclose to the person concerned or counsel if applicable and to the ID the \nfollowing documents: \n \n“Request for Admissibility Hearing/Detention review” form (BSF 524); \n \nA copy of the 44(1) report, if applicable; \n \na copy of the removal order, if applicable;  \nall other documentary evidence or information that is relevant to the hearing. In the case of a 48-\nhour or a seven-day detention review, all documents must be disclosed as soon as possible. In all \nother cases documents must be disclosed at least five (5) business days before the hearing. [ID \nRules, Rule 26]. \n                                                             \n5 Charkaoui v. Canada (MCI), [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350 at paras. 107-117.\n2022-03-03 \n \n63 \nHearings officers should be particularly mindful of this deadline for disclosure in the case of \nlong-term detainees who are undergoing detention reviews on a 30-day cycle.  \nNote: Rule 50 of the ID Rules, grants the member broad discretionary powers to change the \nrequirements of a rule and/or modify time limits. In the interests of conducting a fair and fulsome \nhearing, the member may choose to accept evidence provided after the deadlines, in the form of \nlate disclosure. However, hearings officers should only consider late disclosure to provide \nevidence on recent and pertinent developments about the case, which occurred before the \ndetention review but after the deadline for disclosure has passed or where the evidence was \notherwise unavailable before the deadline for disclosure had passed.  \nCommunity Liaison Officers (CLOs) and Inland Enforcement Officers (IEOs) are responsible for \nupdating the file and providing the hearings officer with additional documentary evidence, as \nsoon as possible in advance of the deadline for disclosure.  \nWhen interviews conducted by IEOs take place, they should be documented, preferably in a \nQ&A format, and should include all available information including impediments to removal, \nsteps to resolve impediments, all actions taken on the file, follow up with consulates/embassies, \ntravel document (TD) issuance timeframe, process for obtaining a TD. Although, the evidence \nwill most frequently take the form of written declarations, CLOs and IEOs may be summoned by \nthe member to provide witness testimony at a detention review, should questions on the case \nremain, even after the evidence was disclosed and submissions were made by the hearings \nofficer. \nIn the case of a detention on identity grounds, evidence disclosed should also include any \ndocuments (or copies of documents) that were found in possession of the person at the time of \narrest that may speak to their identity or purpose of their presence in Canada.  There could be \nother reasons for which the documents may be used at a hearing.  \n \nNote: All documents must comply with the requirements set out in the ID Rules 24 and 25 \nwith respect to language and format. \n \nNote: If the person concerned has retained counsel, the hearings officer should ensure that \ncopies of the relevant notices and documents are sent to counsel [Rule 28(3)]. \n14.2.2 Detention under A58(1)(c) \nA58(1)(c) sets out that the ID shall order the release of a foreign national or permanent resident \nunless it is satisfied that: \n(c) the Minister is taking necessary steps to inquire into a reasonable suspicion that they \nare inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious \ncriminality, criminality or organized criminality; \nWhile hearings officers will most likely handle such cases when the person concerned was \ndetained under A55(3), this need not be the case. Persons may have been detained under the\n2022-03-03 \n \n64 \nauthority of A55(1) or A55(2) and subsequent developments might lead to a change in grounds \nfor detention. \nThe FC assessed, in Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. Ismail, \nthe relationship between the grounds for arresting and detaining an individual under IRPA, and \nthe grounds that permit continued detention of that individual by the ID.  \nThe Federal Court at paragraph 65 in Ismail determined that “[T]o interpret paragraph 58(1)(c) \nof IRPA so as to permit the detention of an individual in order to allow the Minister to take \nnecessary steps to inquire into a reasonable suspicion that the individual is inadmissible on \ngrounds of security, when that suspicion only arises after the person has entered Canada, accords \nwith the priority that the legislation ascribes to security.” \nIn all cases, if seeking continued detention under A58(1)(c), the hearings officer must satisfy the \nmember on whether the Minister is taking necessary steps to verify a reasonable suspicion of \ninadmissibility. The hearings officer:  \n Must describe the basis for the reasonable suspicion of inadmissibility; \n Should describe the steps the Minister has taken so far; \n Should  describe the future steps the Minister intends to take. \nThe member is limited to examining whether the proposed steps have the potential to uncover \nrelevant evidence bearing on the Minister’s suspicion. It is not up to the member to dictate steps \nto be taken in the investigation, or speculate on potential outcomes. \nIn Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. X, the Federal Court reaffirmed the limitations to the \nmember’s supervisory jurisdiction during a detention review for a person detained on those \ngrounds. “The government cannot use ss. 58(1)(c) as the basis for indefinitely detaining foreign \nnationals, but it is entitled to a reasonable time to complete its admissibility investigation.” \n \nIn essence, the jurisprudence limits the ability and obligation of the member to place weight on \nthe time spent in detention, which R248 normally requires them to do. This in turn weakens the \nsuitability of ATDs. Nevertheless, the hearings officer must continue to demonstrate that the \nMinister is conducting its ongoing investigation in good faith. If the investigation shows signs of \nfaltering, it may be necessary for the officer to argue for continued detention under different \ngrounds set out in A58(1)(a), A58(1)(b) or A58(1)(d), in which case the full range of factors \nR248 will need to be addressed, as they will be considered by the member. \nFor additional information on detention on entry of persons under A55(3)(b), refer to ENF 20 \nDetention, Section 5.5 Suspected of security risk/human or international rights violations. \n14.2.3 Alternatives to detention (ATD) \nThe matter of ATDs must form part of the submissions by the Minister. ATDs are evidently not \nsuitable to all cases but, as set out in R248(e), the member is required to consider their \navailability, effectiveness and appropriateness in their decision.\n2022-03-03 \n \n65 \nWhile there is no obligation on the Minister to find  an ATD, there is an ongoing obligation to \nconsider ATD. There is a statutory duty to ensure that a person is not detained for immigration \npurposes unless certain criteria is met. The main principle of the IRPA detention scheme is that \ndetention is a last resort.  \nReasonable efforts throughout the detention process should be made by the Minister to \nparticipate in keeping the person out of detention unless the reasons for detention dictate \notherwise (R244-247).  Even if the person is a danger to the public or a flight risk, the ongoing \nobligation requires the Minister to consider if there would be any ATD that could mitigate that \nrisk.  \nConsequently, and even if not applicable in a particular case, hearings officers should not limit \ntheir submissions on the matter to stating that there was “no suitable alternative”, but rather \nexplain why the potential alternatives are not appropriate, or are otherwise insufficient to manage \nthe risk in the case at hand. However, this finding is not immutable, and ATDs will be actively \nre-assessed by the member at every subsequent detention review. The hearings officer should \nkeep in mind that change in a person’s circumstance may render a previously-rejected alternative \ninto a viable option, especially in the case of long-term detentions. \nThe CBSA’s expanded ATD Program was implemented on June 22, 2018 and is intended to \naugment the existing options that were available to the CBSA and the IRB to manage individuals \nsubject to immigration detention. The CBSA’s ATD Program provides officers with an expanded \nset of tools and programs that enable them to manage individuals released into the community \nmore effectively.  This included the creation of Community Liaison Officers (CLOs) who assist \nin examining the existence and feasibility of alternative’s to detention.  \nWhen release on conditions are deemed appropriate, the hearings officer must be ready to \narticulate in their submission the reasons for which those conditions should be imposed on the \nperson concerned. \nFor additional information on alternatives to detention, refer to ENF 34 \nExamining bondspersons proposed at a detention review \n \nThe person detained or their counsel may propose a bondsperson to secure the release of a person \nin detention. When a potential bondsperson is proposed at the hearing, there may be insufficient \ntime to have their ability to pay a cash deposit or post a guarantee formally assessed. Interactions \nwith the bondsperson should be on the record; hearings officers should examine bondspersons on \nthe record, with the bondsperson providing testimony under oath. \n \nThe hearings officer should cross-examine the proposed bondsperson at the detention review to \nassess their suitability and gather evidence for their submissions which may be a submission that \nthe alternative to detention is inadequate to offset the risk. If the proposed bondsperson is not \navailable to testify either in person or by phone, the Member may ask that they be available at \nthe next detention review, or schedule an early detention review at which time the bondsperson \nmay testify. In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Ke, the Federal court\n2022-03-03 \n \n66 \nestablished that a decision by the Member to release without giving the opportunity to the \nMinister to cross-examine the proposed bondsperson can be a breach of procedural fairness and \nnatural justice.  \n \nThe line of questioning for a proposed bondsperson should examine that proposed bondsperson’s \nability to ensure the person concerned’s compliance with conditions of release, and not merely \nthe dollar amount of the bond or value of the guarantee proposed.  \n \nProposed bondspersons should be asked about: \n their immigration status and ties to the community; \n their relationship with the person concerned; \n their knowledge of the person concerned’s immigration status and if applicable, criminal \nhistory; \n their own living situation; \n willingness to provide shelter to the person concerned; \n how they plan to exert influence on the person. \n \nIt is also relevant and appropriate to enquire about the potential bondsperson’s income, assets, \ntheir ability to pay a cash deposit or fulfill the obligation from the guarantee. R47(3) gives an \nofficer (as designated by the Minister of Public Safety) the authority to refuse the posting of a \ndeposit or guarantee if they believe that it was, or will not be legally obtained. Any concerns that \nthe proposed bondsperson will be posting a deposit or guarantee via illegally-obtained funds \nshould be raised by the hearings officer at the detention review for the member to consider when \nassessing the suitability of the bondsperson. \n \nThe hearings officer should also present a position to the member on the reliability of the \nguarantor. For example, a proposed guarantor who has defaulted on a previous bond and remains \nin default, is no longer eligible to be a guarantor. \n \nA guarantor’s criminal record may reflect the importance they place on law and order and social \nnorms to respect compliance with laws and regulations. Similarly a guarantor’s potential \ncriminal associations, even in the absence of a criminal record, may speak to their character and \ntheir respect for the rule of law. \n \nIn cases of bondspersons proposed at the hearing, the officer should clearly indicate to the \nmember of the ID, the detained person, and their counsel (if applicable), that another officer will \nbe determining whether the bondsperson has the ability to pay the cash deposit and/or fulfil the \nguarantee before release (as ordered by the ID) can occur.  \nNote: For additional information on deposits and guarantees, please refer to ENF 8, Deposits and \nGuarantees. \nElectronic monitoring (EM) \nEM is intended to be used in conjunction with community case management and supervision, a \ndeposit or guarantee, or both for individuals who present a high risk if released into the\n2022-03-03 \n \n67 \ncommunity but whose predicted length of detention favours release. Individuals on EM usually \nhave restrictions on places and times that they can be in the community that eliminates or \nsufficiently reduces the risk that they pose to warrant release. \nEM has in the past been put forward by counsel or the person concerned as an alternative to \ndetention. However, due to the high initial and recurring costs, such proposals are rare and \nlimited to individuals with access to significant financial resources. Should such an alternative be \nproposed, hearings officers should highlight the difference between self-financed EM and the \nthose conducted by CBSA. Self-financed EM is not associated with community case \nmanagement and supervision, which the CBSA maintains is an essential component to mitigate \nrisk.   \nFor additional information on alternatives to detention and EM, refer section 4.6 of ENF 34 \n14.2.4 Detention and vulnerable groups \nIn preparing for the detention review, the hearings officer should review the Revised National \nRisk Assessment for Detention (NRAD) form on file to verify if the person has been identified as \nbelonging to a vulnerable group. There is a heightened need to consider ATDs when faced with \nvulnerable persons as their continued detention may cause a particular hardship. \n Therefore, alternatives to detention including less restrictive ATDs, should be duly considered  \nand when hearings officers recommend continued detention for a vulnerable person, hearings \nofficers should explain to the Member why the ATD is not suitable. \nAt the hearing, the member may allow certain accommodations to ensure that such vulnerable \npersons are not disadvantaged in presenting their cases. The member may also schedule early \ndetention reviews to monitor the status of the vulnerable person to insist on a rapid progression \non the file. \nFor more information on vulnerable groups at the detention stage, refer to ENF20 Detention, \nsection 6.13 as well as Chairperson Guideline 8: ‘Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons \nAppearing Before the IRB’ \n \nMinors (under 18 years of age) \nA60 explicitly establishes the detention of a minor must be a measure of last resort, taking into \naccount other applicable grounds and criteria, including the best interests of the child (BIOC). \nMembers will place a high degree of importance on the BIOC when they adjudicate the detention \nreview. \nIn their submissions, depending on the evidence available to the hearings officer, the officer \nshould address the following as much as possible hearings officers should address: \no the child’s physical, emotional and psychological well-being;\n2022-03-03 \n \n68 \no the child’s healthcare and educational needs; \no the importance of maintaining relationships and the stability of the family \nenvironment, and the possible effect on the child of disrupting those relationships \nor that stability; \no the care, protection and safety needs of the child; and \no the child’s views and preferences, provided the child is capable of forming their \nown views or expressing their preferences, taking into consideration the child’s \nage and maturity. \nThe National Directive for the Detention or Housing of Minors, sets out that: \nthe interests of a housed minor is a factor that can be taken into the decision to detain or \nmaintain detention of a parent and are to be weighed along with other mandatory factors \nunder R248 \nAs well, the separation of the child from the parent can be a source of anxiety and may be a \nfactor weighing in favour of the release of the parent, in the interest of the child. \nIf a minor is detained, or housed with their detained parent, hearings officers should provide \ndetails to the member on the ATDs which were assessed by the Minister as not being suitable. In \ntheir submissions, officers should not limit themselves to stating that there was “no suitable \nalternative” and describe why the detention/housing was used “as a measure of last resort.” \n[A60].  \nSee National Directive for the Detention or Housing of Minors, for more information. \n \nDetainees and mental health \n \nFor information regarding detainees and mental health issues refer to ENF 7 Ch 18.6 \n \n14.3 Making a recommendation on detention  \nScenarios \nSituation – taking into consideration the \nfactors set out in R248  \nHearings officers should consider the \nfollowing:  \n \nThe hearings officer defends the position that, \nwhile the grounds for detentions are still \npresent, the person concerned should be \nThe hearings officer should consider the \narresting officer’s notes in conjunction with the \nnotes and recommendation from the \nCommunity Liaison Officer (CLO) on whether \na deposit, guarantee and/or another alternative \nto detention would be appropriate in the\n2022-03-03 \n \n69 \nreleased on conditions and/or an alternative to \ndetention (ATD) and/or a bond/guarantee \ncircumstances and make the recommendation \naccordingly. The hearings officer should \nconsider the financial situation of the person \nconcerned and/or prospective guarantor(s). \nThe hearings officer may provide submissions \non the nature and the size of the bond and/or \nconditions that should be imposed.   \nThe hearings officer defends the position that \ndetention should continue.  \nDisclose new evidence on developments of the \ncase at each detention review. The argument \nfor continued detention should be consistent \nwith the recommendations of the CLO and the \nDetainee Medical Needs form (if applicable). \nIn submissions, the hearings officer should \narticulate why or how alternatives to detention \nare not suitable in this particular case. \nThe hearings officer defends the position that \nthe standard of proof to support the grounds for \ndetention is no longer met, or that there is no \nneed and/or justification to continue detention.  \nThe hearings officer should submit an \napplication for an early detention review and \nindicate that the Minister has no objection to \nthe release of the person concerned, thus \nrecommending release on an ATD and/or with \nconditions.  \nNote: this scenario is most frequently seen in \npersons detained on identity grounds whereby \nthe Minister becomes reasonably satisfied of \nthe person’s identity. \nWhenever possible, a recommendation by the Minister for release of the detained person should \nbe discussed with the detained person or counsel for the detained person, where represented, \nprior to the hearing so that agreement or potential disagreement on certain terms and conditions \nsought by the Minister is known ahead of time. \nWhen recommending release with conditions, the hearings officer should be satisfied that the \nguarantor, where one is being proposed, is in a position to exercise control over the movements \nof the person released, and that the person concerned will report for immigration proceedings as \nrequired.  \n14.3.1 Detention review for designated foreign nationals \nPursuant to A20.1(1), the Minister of Public Safety has the authority to order the arrival in \nCanada of a group of persons to be designated as an “irregular arrival.” A foreign national who is \npart of a group whose arrival in Canada is designated by the Minister as an “irregular arrival” \nautomatically becomes a “designated foreign national” (DFN) unless he or she holds the \ndocuments required for entry, and on examination the officer is satisfied that the person is not \ninadmissible to Canada [A20.1(2)].\n2022-03-03 \n \n70 \nDFNs are subject to mandatory arrest and detention and a revised detention review timeline. \nUpon designation, the CBSA must arrest and detain all DFNs who were 16 years of age or older \nat the time of the arrival, where the designated irregular arrival occurred on or after June 28 \n2012. \nTimeline for scheduling of detention reviews \nThe following modified detention timeline applies to all DFNs who are 16 years or older: \n A57.1(1) provides that the ID must review the reasons for continued detention within 14 \ndays after a DFN was detained. \n \nNote: This means the ID may schedule the detention review at any time from the day the \nDFN was detained to day 14 of detention.  \n \n Pursuant to A57.1(2), subsequent detention reviews must take place after the expiry of 6 \nmonths following the conclusion of the previous review.   \nNote: This means that the ID must schedule the next detention review following the \nexpiry of 6 months after the previous review, and not prior to the expiry of those 6 \nmonths. \nThe DFN will be present at each detention review, either in person or by way of video - or \nteleconference, unless they decide not to participate. \nGrounds for detention of a DFN \nIt should also be noted that new grounds for detention apply to DFNs under A58(1)(e) and \nA58(1.1). As per A58(1.1), the ID shall order the continued detention of a DFN if it is satisfied \nthat any of the grounds described in A58(1)(a), (b), (c), or (e) exist. At the initial 14 day review, \nthe ID may not consider any other factors, including the factors in R248. \nDesignation while under IRPA detention \nIf a DFN is under immigration detention at the time of a designation decision, and has had the \nreasons for detention reviewed by the IRB on at least one occasion (e.g., a 48-hour review), then \nthe individual's next review will be six months after the conclusion of the last IRB review. The \nprevious review(s) will have fulfilled the requirement for a review within 14 days of being taken \ninto detention.  \nThe member of the ID may decide to restart the detention review timeline by granting the DFN a \n14-day review, even in cases where a 48-hour, seven-day, and 30-day review have already been \nheld. If the ID schedules a 14-day detention review in such a circumstance, hearings officers are \nadvised to argue that the ID does not have jurisdiction to hold a 14-day review, while also stating \nthat they are prepared to proceed with the detention review if the ID does not agree. In such \ninstances, hearings officers should consult with NHQ for assistance.\n2022-03-03 \n \n71 \nIf the ID releases a DFN from detention, depending on the case, it may be appropriate to seek \njudicial review and a stay of the release decision.  \nSee the Designated Irregular Arrivals Toolkit in Atlas, for more information. \n \n14.4 Outcomes of an admissibility hearing and effects on detention \n \n14.4.1 Detained person found described at the hearing  \nIf, at the conclusion of the admissibility hearing, the member of the ID finds the person described \nand issues a removal order, this will impact the case for the next detention review; the person \nwould now be detained for removal. However, the mere fact of having been found inadmissible \nby the ID does not, in isolation, strengthen the case for continued detention.   \nAlthough removal is the last step in the immigration enforcement process there might be several \nimpediments to removal which would prolong detention. Hearings officers must be prepared to \nspeak to a timeline for the estimated time of continued detention, bearing in mind that any \n“estimation of anticipated future length of detention should be the proceedings as they exist at \nthe time of each monthly review and not on an anticipation of available processes, but not yet \nunderway” [Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Li, 2009 FCA 85]. \nSee ENF 10, Removals, for more information. \nNote: If the member of the ID releases from detention a permanent resident or foreign national \nwho is the subject of a report on inadmissibility on grounds of security (A34) which has been \nreferred to the ID, or is the subject of a removal order for inadmissibility on grounds of security \n(A34), the member of the ID is required to impose prescribed conditions on the person, set out in \nR250.1. \n \n14.4.2 Detained person not found described at the hearing. \n \nIf the member of the ID finds that the person is not inadmissible, this might negate the authority \nto detain under A55, unless the person has a pending refugee claim or is being detained on \nidentity grounds.  \nIn the case of a foreign national detained on entry, A45(b) grants the Member the authority to \ngrant permanent or temporary resident status if they are satisfied that they meet the requirements \nof the IRPA. Should the Member avail themselves of that authority, this would conclude the \nexamination and terminate the authority to detain under A55(3).\n2022-03-03 \n \n72 \nThe Minister can also seek recourse against a member’s decision by bringing the matter before \nthe IAD or the Federal Court. See section 13.1 for information on recourse against a positive \ndecision at an admissibility hearing. \n \n14.5 Post-detention review procedures \n \n14.5.1 Carrying out a decision of the Immigration Division  \nWhen the detention review is concluded, the hearings officer has two specific areas of \nresponsibility to ensure that the member's decision is carried out: \nReporting \n \nIf the member of the ID ordered the continued detention of the person concerned, the \nhearings officer must take the appropriate action and annotate the file accordingly; \n \nIf the member of the ID ordered the release of the person concerned, the hearings officer \nmust give the case file to the detentions unit for action;  \n \nThat being said, it may occur, in the course of the detention review, that statements or \ncommitments are being made by the bondsperson as the member of the ID was assessing \ntheir financial capacity and ability to comply. If the ability to pay and/or solvency is \nassessed during the detention review process, hearings officers will document the \noutcome of what was assessed and agreed to by all parties during the detention review \nusing form BSF211. The completed form will be made available to the officer processing \nthe bond, for their awareness on what transpired at the hearing. See ENF 8, Deposits and \nGuarantees, for more information. \nFeedback \n \nWhere time permits, the hearings office should provide the results of the detention review to the \nofficers who arrested and detained the permanent resident or the foreign national under the \nprovisions of the IRPA, as the case may be. The hearings officers should provide feedback to \nthose involved in specific cases for training purposes, and to advise IEOs and CLOs of the \neffectiveness of their work. \n \n14.5.2 Applications for stay of release and leave for judicial review  \nWhere hearings officers are of the opinion that there are, or may be, grounds to seek judicial \nreview of the member’s decision, hearings officers should consult with their manager .If the \nmanager concurs, the hearings officer should immediately contact the Regional Justice Liaison \nOfficer (JLO) to seek an emergency stay of the ID’s release order, pending an application for \nleave for a judicial review of the decision. If the JLO is not available, the hearings officer may \nsend the report directly to CBSA litigation management unit (LMU) at National Headquarters :\n2022-03-03 \n \n73 \nlitigation-management@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca. The hearings officer or the hearings advisor should \nalso request an urgent copy of the transcript of the detention review with the IRB registrar. \nThe report is to be transmitted by email to the LMU. It is imperative that a copy of the  \ntranscript, when received, is forwarded as expeditiously as possible. This will allow sufficient \ntime for review and the necessary consultations. This will also allow the LMU to give \nappropriate instructions to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and to give the DOJ time to prepare \napplications to seek leave for judicial review.  \nNote: Officers should keep in mind that whey they email information that is ‘Protected B’ they \nare only permitted to do so using PKI encryption. If the case contains information with a higher \nclassification level, refer to the CBSA Security volume for guidance on alternative secure \ncommunications systems and coordinate with LMU. \nSee ENF 9, Judicial Review, for more information.\n2022-03-03 \n \n74 \nAppendix A List of Cases / Rules of Evidence \n \nReferences \nCanadian courts \n \nFederal Court of Canada, Trial Division (FCTD or FC) \n \nFederal Court of Canada, Appeal Division (Federal Court of Appeal) (FCA)  \n \nSupreme Court of Canada (SCC) \nList of cases cited throughout this manual chapter \n \nAlmrei (Re), 2009 FC 3. \n \nBowen v.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 338 \nRules of evidence \nA173(c) sets out that the Immigration Division is not bound by the strict rules of evidence that \nare found in judicial proceedings. However, it must observe the principles of procedural fairness. \n1. The admissibility of evidence  \nIn judicial proceedings, strict rules govern the admissibility of evidence. The two basic rules are \n \nthe best evidence rule, which requires that the evidence presented be the best evidence \navailable (this means that secondary evidence should not be introduced unless primary \nevidence is unavailable); R v Wood, 2008 FCA 302 \nthe rule against hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is testimony given by a witness, offered as \nproof of the truth of the matters contained in the testimony, which is not the personal knowledge \nof the witness but rather the mere repetition of what the witness heard others say. Such evidence \nis very weak, since the real author of the statement put in evidence is not available for cross-\nexamination and therefore the credibility of the statement and its author cannot be tested; R v \nO’Brien, [1978] 1 SCR 591, 76 DLR (3d) 513.I  \n \n \nAt an admissibility hearing, any evidence considered by the member of the ID to be relevant, \ncredible, and trustworthy in the circumstances of the case is admissible. In the examination of the \nevidence presented, the member of the ID will determine its weight or value, taking into\n2022-03-03 \n \n76 \nconsideration all relevant information. Hearings officers are to follow the best evidence rule \nwhen they are able to. However, there will be occasions when a statutory declaration or a note to \nfile from an officer will suffice as a reliable substitute for more direct evidence under the \ncircumstances. Generally, members of the ID will accept hearsay evidence, but they will attach \nvery little significance to it if contradictory evidence is offered by the other party. \n2. The relevance of evidence  \nThe member of the ID will normally consider relevant any evidence that reasonably tends to \nprove the fact in dispute, that is: \n \nevidence which places a fact in a context which tends to show its relevance;  \n \nevidence relating to credibility; and  \n \nevidence that proves a precondition for the presentation of a fact (e.g., evidence that a \nstatement was made freely and voluntarily). \n3. The weight of evidence  \nThe weight of evidence is its probative value, or importance, and the extent to which it \nestablishes a fact before the tribunal. The stronger the inference that can be derived from the \nevidence, the higher the probative value. A number of pieces of evidence, each of low probative \nvalue, may be more significant when considered in the overall context of the admissibility \nhearing than a single piece of evidence that seemingly has very high probative value.  \nAdmissibility of evidence and probative value are two different matters. A document of low \nprobative value may still be admissible into evidence if it is relevant.  \nSecondary or hearsay evidence may not have the same weight when better evidence is available. \nFor example, if the hearings officer uses a statutory declaration made by an officer who is \nreasonably available to testify, the hearings officer is depriving the other party of the opportunity \nto cross-examine and the hearings officer detracts from the quality of the evidence.  \nAs a general rule, the hearings officer should attempt to secure the best evidence whenever \npossible. When this is not possible, would be prohibitively expensive or would cause major \nadministrative difficulties, the hearings officer may ask the member of the ID to accept \nsecondary evidence.  \nWhen making a decision to rely on primary or secondary evidence, the hearings officer should \ntake into account factors such as the importance of other aspects of the case, and the need to \navoid lengthy detention while waiting for stronger evidence. The hearings officer should also \nkeep in mind that the weaker the evidence in relation to evidence presented by the opposing \nparty, the greater the possibility that the member of the ID will admit the person concerned to \nCanada.  \nThe main points to consider when assessing available evidence are as follows:\n2022-03-03 \n \n77 \n \nIs this evidence relevant?  \n \nWhat facts are established or can be deduced from this evidence? \n \nWhat is its weight?  \nTypes of evidence \n1. Direct evidence  \nDirect evidence is a means of proof which tends to show the existence of a fact in question \nwithout the intervention of the proof of any other fact. This includes testimony by witnesses who \nsaw the act being done or heard the words spoken to prove a fact that is at issue.  \nDirect evidence may also consist of documents or objects introduced through the oral testimony \nof witnesses. \nThe hearings officer should always introduce documents or objects into evidence by first \nestablishing a link between the document or the object and the witness, and second, by \nestablishing the relevance of the document or object to the fact the hearings officer wishes to \nprove. \nFor example, if the hearings officer wishes to introduce a passport or other documents claimed to \nbelong to the subject of the admissibility hearing, the hearings officer should ask the witness to \nidentify the document(s) for the member of the ID. If the witness is unable or refuses to identify \nthe document, the hearings officer may need to call the officer who seized the document(s) as a \nwitness to establish the link between the document(s) and the subject of the admissibility \nhearing. \nAfter establishing the link, the hearings officer may then ask questions to establish the relevance \nof the document in relation to the facts the hearings officer intends to prove. \n2. Circumstantial evidence  \nCircumstantial evidence is evidence not based on actual personal, direct knowledge or \nobservation of the facts at issue. It is indirect evidence, the sum of which can lead a member of \nthe ID to conclude that a fact which could not be established by direct evidence, has been \nestablished by inference. \nFor example, circumstantial evidence may consist of evidence relating to motive, opportunity, \nintent, character or previous activities. Such circumstances taken individually may not carry \nenough weight to persuade the member of the ID of an allegation; however, when argued in \ncombination, they may be sufficient to tip the balance of probabilities. \n3. Presumption  \nSince in many cases it is almost impossible to prove certain facts, the rules of evidence provide \nthat certain facts may be presumed to be true. Two types of presumption may apply:\n2022-03-03 \n \n78 \n \ndeductions of fact that are deductions or conclusions that can be drawn from the \ncircumstantial evidence submitted; and  \n \npresumptions under IRPA. \n4. Judicial notice  \nJudicial notice is the recognition by a judicial tribunal that a fact is true, without its having to be \nproven, on the basis that the fact is known to the tribunal because it is not the subject of dispute \namong reasonable people or because the fact can be demonstrated to be accurate through \nchecking readily accessible sources. \nMembers of the ID may take judicial notice of facts generally known to everyone. For example, \na member of the ID may take judicial notice of any fact relating to the member’s profession, such \nas the duties of a member of the ID, the IRPA and its Regulations. Members of the ID may not \ntake judicial notice of a fact known as a result of purely personal knowledge. \nDocumentary evidence and testimony \n1. Documentary evidence  \nHearings officers will often use documents to establish allegations. If used appropriately, \npresenting documents in evidence can speed up the process. Generally speaking, a member of the \nID may accept documentary evidence if it is admissible (relevant, credible or trustworthy), \nsubject to its probative value. \nOfficial documents (e.g., passports and certified court documents) generally have more weight \nthan unofficial documents (e.g. letters and uncertified copies of documents). \nOriginal documents usually have more weight than copies, unless the copy is a duplicate copy (a \nsigned copy of the original) or a certified true copy produced or issued by a competent authority. \nThe best evidence rule dictates that the hearings officer should submit the original of a \ndocument. If this is not possible, secondary evidence becomes the best evidence. Hearings \nofficers should verify that the documents they wish to introduce at an admissibility hearing refer \nto the person concerned. \n2. Statutory declarations  \nHearings officers may introduce statutory declarations into evidence that are relevant to the \nproceedings. A member of the ID accepts statutory declarations at an admissibility hearing \nbecause they are equivalent to testimony under oath [Canada Evidence Act, s. 14(2)]. However, a \nstatutory declaration may be of less probative value than the oral testimony of the author when \nthe credibility of the author of the statutory declaration cannot be tested by cross-examination.  \n3. Testimony\n2022-03-03 \n \n79 \nThe best form of testimony is that given by a witness relating facts of which the witness has \npersonal knowledge. Positive evidence (e.g., facts that the witness actually observed or knows) \ncarries more weight than negative evidence (that which was not seen or is unknown). Direct \nevidence is preferable to circumstantial evidence, and opinion evidence has value only if an \nexpert gives it. Hearsay evidence, while admissible (if relevant), usually carries little or no \nweight when countered by direct evidence.\n2022-03-03 \n \n80 \nAppendix B Additional Guidance and \nJurisprudence \n \n1 Adjournments to seek a temporary resident permit \nThe person concerned or that person's counsel may request an adjournment to seek a temporary \nresident permit (TRP). The hearings officer should oppose such adjournment requests unless \nsatisfied that the person concerned deserves such a permit, or the hearings officer has received \nnotification that the Minister of PSEP wishes to review the application for a TRP. Thus, in \nassessing whether in the opinion of the hearings officer the person deserves a TRP, the case file \nshould be reviewed carefully to see whether any previous reviews have been conducted. \nIn Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), the Supreme Court upheld the \nadjudicator’s (now member of the Immigration Division’s) refusal to adjourn because the person \nconcerned had from the date of their removal (June 6, 1984) until the date when the hearing was \nscheduled to proceed (November 21, 1984) to make the application for a Minister’s permit \n(former version of a TRP), but a letter (the application) was not sent to the Minister's office until \nNovember 16, 1984. The judge notes in his reasons:  \n\"The logic of the appellant's submission would thus require that the [member of the Immigration \nDivision] adjourn the [admissibility hearing] whenever the result of that [hearing] has the \npotential to inhibit the subject of that [hearing] from pursuing an alternative remedy. This would \namount to reading into the legislation an automatic stay. [I]t is untenable to hinder the \n[Immigration Division] process under the Immigration Act, 1976 by laying down such an \ninflexible rule for the conduct of an [admissibility hearing] \" (paragraph 24) \nSee also: \n \nCanada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Widmont. \n \nLouhisdon v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration). \n \nMurray v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration). \n2 Adjournments for humanitarian considerations \nThe person concerned or that person's counsel may request an adjournment to examine \nhumanitarian considerations: \nJiminez-Perez v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration); Green v. Canada (Minister \nof Employment and Immigration); Koutsouveli v. Canada (Minister of Employment and \nImmigration); Chhokar v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration).  \nIn Green v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), , the Federal Court of Appeal \nnoted that the Jiminez-Perez case did not require that the adjudicator (now Member of the ID)\n2022-03-03 \n \n81 \nwho receives an application pursuant to A115(2) (now A25(1)) during an inquiry (now \nadmissibility hearing) adjourn immediately until the Minister or his delegate renders a decision \non the application. The member of the ID is required to proceed with the hearing as \nexpeditiously as is possible under the circumstances of each individual case. Likewise the power \nof the member of the Immigration Division to adjourn is restricted to adjournments \"for the \npurpose of ensuring a full and proper admissibility hearing.\"  \nSee also: \n \nChhokar v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), \n \nIn Koutsouveli v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (paragraph 13), the \nFederal Court, Trial Division, noted that an application for an exemption submitted under \nsection A115(2) [now A25(1)] in no way permits the hearing under A27 (now A44) to be \nstayed.  \nIn Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Fox, the Federal Court noted that the \nImmigration Division did not have any discretion to consider humanitarian and compassionate \nfactors at the admissibility hearing (paragraph 42). The Immigration Division’s “decision to \ngrant the adjournment was driven by its desire to allow the respondent to remain with his family \nand to benefit from his day parole” (paragraph 41).  \nIn Fox, the member of the ID granted the respondent a 13-month adjournment of his \nadmissibility hearing for an A36(1)(a) allegation of IRPA. The Federal Court overturned that \ndecision and said the following: \n \n[39] Once a section 44 Report is referred to the Immigration Division for an admissibility \nhearing, pursuant to subsection 162(2) and paragraph 173(b) of the IRPA, the \nadmissibility hearing must be heard as quickly as the circumstances and the \nconsiderations of procedural fairness and natural justice permit and without delay. The \nTribunal’s function at the admissibility hearing is exclusively to find facts. If the member \nfinds the person is a person described in paragraph 36(1)(a) of the IRPA, then pursuant to \nparagraph 45(d) of the IRPA and paragraph 229(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee \nProtection Regulations, the Tribunal must issue a deportation order against the person. \n3 Adjournments for additional evidence or arguments \nThe hearings officer, the person concerned, or counsel may request an adjournment to obtain \nadditional evidence or to prepare a legal or constitutional argument or submission. \nRule 47 of the ID rules sets out the modalities of bringing forward a constitutional question, and \nthe contents of said notice. Also, Rule 47(4) imposes that, at a minimum, a 10-day notice be \nprovided to all parties prior to a constitutional being made.\n2022-03-03 \n \n82 \n4 Adjournments for a change of venue \nThe member of the ID may grant an adjournment to allow for a change of venue, if the member \ndecides that such a change is necessary for holding a full and proper admissibility hearing. The \nmember of the ID will hear from both parties before making a decision. For further information \nsee the Immigration Division Rules, Rule 42. \n5 Adjournments in an admissibility hearing pending a ministerial relief application \nA person concerned who is inadmissible under A34(1) A35(1)(b) and (c) or A37(1), except a \nperson who has committed or was complicit in human rights violations as described in A35(1), \ncan submit a request for relief to the Minister. An applicant bears the onus of satisfying the \nMinister that his/her presence in Canada would not be contrary to the national interest \n[A42.1(1)]. \nR24.1 (1) sets out that a person cannot apply for ministerial relief until a removal order has been \nissued against them or they have been refused a permanent or temporary residence visa \napplication, on the basis of a determination of inadmissibility under section 34, paragraph \n35(1)(b) or (c) or subsection 37(1) of IRPA.  \nConsequently, the hearings officer should oppose applications for adjournment of an \nadmissibility hearing based on an intention to file ministerial relief application, which cannot \noccur until the person is found described at the conclusion of said admissibility hearing.\n2022-03-03 \n \n83 \nAppendix C Manager’s approval to appear \nUnique client identifier (UCI): \nImmigration Division file number:  \nMANAGER’S APPROVAL \nMANAGER’S APPROVAL for a hearings officer to appear in person at A36(1)(a) admissibility \nhearing due to exceptional circumstances \nRequested by _________________________, hearings officer/hearings advisor. \nHearings officer recommendation to manager, to appear in person in exceptional circumstances \nfor A36(1)(a) admissibility hearing scheduled on ___________________________ based on the \nfollowing exception(s): \n \n☐ Jurisdictional arguments \n \n☐ Constitutional challenges are being argued and the issue has not previously been addressed by \nthe higher court enabling the Minister to make written submissions.  \n \n☐ The PC is detained on immigration hold and the ID combines the admissibility hearing and the \ndetention review on the same day. \nJustification: \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________  \n \nManager approves ☐ \n \nManager does not approve ☐ \nJustification: \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n______________________________________________________________________________  \nManager’s name ____________________________  Date _____________________________ \nSignature________________________________\n2022-03-03 \n \n84 \nAppendix D Template for an Application to \nAppear for an admissibility hearing in \nwriting only Pursuant to Rule 38 \nUnique client identifier (UCI): \nImmigration Division file number:  \nIMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE BOARD \nIMMIGRATION DIVISION \nBETWEEN: \nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration \nApplicant \nand \nName of Person concerned \nRespondent \nAPPLICATION \nPursuant to Rule 38 of IRPA Immigration Division Rules \nIn the matter of an Admissibility Hearing pursuant to subsection 44(2) of the Immigration \nand Refugee Protection Act (“Act”) between Name of Person Concerned and the Minister of \nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship, the Minister brings an Application, pursuant to \nsection 38 of the Immigration Division Rules, between the Minister (“Applicant”) and \nName of Person Concerned (“Respondent”) \nTAKE NOTICE that the Applicant applies for an ORDER by the Division to release the \nApplicant from any obligation to appear or present evidence in person including any obligation \nunder Rules 42(3), 43(3) and 48 of the Immigration Division Rules.
