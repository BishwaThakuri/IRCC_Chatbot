What this chapter is about \n \nThis chapter describes the role of a Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) hearings officer while \nacting as counsel at appeals heard before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the \nImmigration and Refugee Board (IRB) for either the Minister of Immigration, Refugee, \nCitizenship Canada (IRCC) or the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PSEP). \nProcedures for the preparation of an appeal, the conduct of appeal proceedings and for post- \nhearing responsibilities are all covered in this chapter. In addition, this chapter will also outline \nthe program objectives, the role and jurisdiction of the IAD, the different types of IAD hearings \nand the ways in which they may be resolved are discussed. \n \n \n2. Program objectives \n \nCanada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) allows specific groups of people to \nappeal to the IAD in order to: \n \n \nensure that prescribed groups of people ordered to be removed from Canada after an \nexamination or admissibility hearing have had the benefit of a full hearing on the \nallegations against them. The Act recognizes an additional commitment to permanent \nresidents, protected persons and foreign nationals who hold a permanent resident visa  by \nallowing them to appeal their removal orders to the IAD, not only on the basis of legal \nand factual questions relating to the allegations at the admissibility hearing, but also on \nthe basis that special considerations may be warranted; \n \nensure that the reunion in Canada of Canadians and permanent residents with their close \nrelatives from abroad is facilitated by providing a review, by way of appeal, of refusals of \nsponsored applications for permanent residence from members of the family class; and \n \nensure that the rights of permanent residents are given due consideration by allowing an \noral appeal to the IAD for loss of residency status determinations made both within and \noutside Canada. \n \nPursuant to A63(5) the Minister may appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against a \ndecision of the Immigration Division (ID) in an admissibility hearing. \n \nThe right of appeal to the IAD is consistent with the objectives of IRPA in that it helps to \naccomplish the following: \n \n \nensure that families are reunited in Canada; and \n \nprotect the health and safety of Canadians and maintain the security of Canadian society. \n \n \n3.

Instrument of delegation and designation \n \nExcept as otherwise provided in section 4 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), \nthe Minister of IRCC is responsible for the administration of IRPA and the Minister of PSEP is \nresponsible for the administration of IRPA as it relates to: \n \na) examination at ports of entry; \nb) the enforcement of IRPA, including arrest, detention and removal; \nc) the establishment of policies respecting the enforcement of IRPA and inadmissibility on \ngrounds of security (A34), organized criminality (A37) or violating human or international \nrights (A35); or \nd) declarations referred to in section 42.1 of the IRPA. \n \nThe Minister of IRCC is responsible for appeals pertaining to visa refusal of family class \n(sponsorship appeals) and residency obligation appeals re decisions made abroad. Consequently \nthe CBSA hearings officers represent the Minister of IRCC for these appeals. \n \nThe Minister of PSEP is responsible for removal order appeals (including for residency obligation \nappeals re in-Canada decisions) and Ministerial appeals against a decision by the IRB \nImmigration Division in an admissibility hearing. The CBSA hearings officers represent the \nMinister of PSEP for these appeals. \n \nThe Minister of IRCC has delegated to the CBSA hearings officers the authority to make an \napplication for non-disclosure of information during an appeal before the IAD made under \nsubsections 63(1) and 63(4) of the IRPA (Item 121 in the June 2017 Instrument). \n \nThe Minister of PSEP has delegated to the CBSA Manager of the Judicial Review Unit and the IRCC \nDirector of Litigation Management the authority to appeal under 63(5).\n22 August 2024  \n \nRefer to IL 3, Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority, for IRCC and the CBSA. \n \n \n5. Departmental policy \n \nUnder section 167 of the IRPA the Minister (whichever Minister that may be according to the \nareas of responsibility articulated in section 4 of the IRPA) may be represented by legal or other \ncounsel. Prior to the creation of the CBSA, IRCC officers represented the Minister before the IAD. \nLegal assistance or personal attendance by a Government lawyer at a hearing was, when \nrequired, provided by the Department of Justice (DOJ). \n \nWith the creation of the CBSA, the responsibility to represent the Minister before the IAD was \npassed from IRCC officers to the CBSA hearings officers. \n \nThere will be rare circumstances where the assistance of a DOJ lawyer may be required. Such \nassistance will usually be in the form of consultation and advice to the hearings officer however \npersonal attendance by the Government lawyer to present legal arguments is also possible. \n \n5.1. Officer safety and security \n \nIf an officer perceives a threat to their safety prior to a hearing, they should immediately \ninform their manager and communicate those concerns to the IRB. The officer should \ncommunicate their safety and security concerns to the IRB by using the form entitled \n“Identification of Potential Security Risk in IRB Proceedings”. If time does not permit, the IRB \ncould be alerted of the security concern verbally and the form submitted as soon as possible. The \nIRB security unit will conduct a risk assessment to determine if additional security measures \nshould be implemented. In certain circumstances, depending on the safety and security concerns \nand location of the scheduled hearing, it may be more appropriate for hearings officers to file an \napplication to request a change of hearing location. A164 provides that whether an IAD hearing \nis to be conducted in the presence of the person who is subject to the proceedings or by means \nof live telecommunication is in the division’s discretion. \n \nSituations may arise during a hearing in which an officer feels their personal safety or the \nsafety of others is being compromised. When an officer feels their safety has been threatened, \nsuch as in situations of intimidation by witnesses, the uttering of threats or other safety \nconcerns, they should immediately bring the matter to the attention of the presiding member \nfirst and then their manager at the earliest opportunity, and take any necessary measure within \nreason to protect their own safety according to the IRB protocol. \n \nIRB procedures for safety and security should help prevent such situations and provide guidance \nfor managing them if they do arise. See Appendix A Detention Safety and Security Annex. \n \n5.2. Incident report writing \n \nWhere an incident occurs before, or during, a hearing where an officer feels their safety has been \nthreatened, they should complete an incident report. Reporting procedures enable the CBSA to\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nmake important decisions regarding the safety and security of staff, ongoing training needs, and \nthe recognition of exemplary performance in difficult situations. \n \n \n6. Definitions \n \nThe hearing process \nImmigration Appeal \nDivision (IAD) \nThe IAD is an administrative tribunal that provides an independent \nreview of decisions made under the immigration program where a right \nof appeal exists. The IAD examines cases before it for possible errors \nin law, in fact, and mixed law and fact, or for failure to observe a \nprinciple of natural justice. It also has the authority to reverse valid \ndecisions on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. This Division is \npart of the IRB and is completely independent of the IRCC, the PSEP \nand their respective Ministers. \n \nA174 states that the IAD is a court of record. It conducts public \nhearings on the basis of the adversary system and established judicial \nprinciples, rules and precedents. The IAD has all the powers, rights and \nprivileges vested in a superior court of record with respect to any \nmatter necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction, including the \nswearing and examination of witnesses, the production and inspection \nof documents, and the enforcement of its orders. \n \nThe matters that may be brought before the IAD are: \n \n \nrefusal to issue a visa to a member of the family class A63(1); \n \nremoval orders made against foreign nationals who hold \npermanent resident visas A63(2); \n \nremoval orders made against permanent residents and \nprotected persons at an examination or admissibility hearing \nA63(3) ; \n \nappeals of overseas decisions on loss of permanent resident \nstatus A63(4); and \n \nMinister’s appeal of a decision made by a member of the \nImmigration Division A63(5). \nHumanitarian and \ncompassionate \nconsiderations \nThe IAD has an equitable jurisdiction, which allows it to consider \nfactors that may warrant an appeal being allowed despite the fact the \ndecision is valid in law. IRPA sets out the test to be applied by the IAD \nin order to allow a case for reasons of equity. Under IRPA, the test of \nequity, which the IAD is to apply, has been consolidated into one test \nfor all types of appeals to the IAD by a party other than the Minister. \nA67(1)(c) states that the IAD must be satisfied that, at the time the \nappeal is disposed of “…taking into account the best interests of a child\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n \ndirectly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and \ncompassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the \ncircumstances of the case.\" \n \nThe IAD will balance factors such as those set out below against the \ngrounds for the removal order or refusal under appeal if it finds in \nfavour of the appellant, it will set aside the decision. In the case of an \nappeal regarding an application based on membership in the family \nclass, the IAD must first be satisfied that the foreign national is a \nmember of the family class and the sponsor is a sponsor within the \nmeaning of the Regulations before it can consider humanitarian and \ncompassionate considerations [A65]. Minister of Public Safety and \nEmergency Preparedness v. Hagos, IMM 6378-11, April 20, 2012]. \n \nFactors to be considered by the IAD in appeals of removal orders \ninclude: \n \n \nthe seriousness of the offence leading to the removal order, \nwhere applicable; \n \nthe possibility of rehabilitation, where applicable; \n \nthe length of time spent in Canada and the degree to which the \nappellant is established here; \n \nthe family in Canada and the dislocation to the family that the \ndeportation would cause; \n \nthe support available to the appellant, not only within the \nfamily but also within the community; \n \nthe degree of hardship that would be caused to the appellant by \ntheir return to their country of nationality, provided that the \nlikely country of removal has been established by the appellant \non a balance of probabilities. \n \nThese factors have been established by the Immigration Appeal \nCommission in Ribic v. Canada (Minister of Employment and \nImmigration), [1985] I.A.B.D. No. 4 (QL). The Supreme Court of \nCanada in Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, \n[2002] 1 S.C.R. 84 at paragraph 90, reaffirmed that “The factors set \nout in Ribic, [supra], remain the proper ones for the IAD to consider \nduring an appeal...” \n \nWhen considering a family class appeal, some of the factors that may \nbe considered by the IAD include: \n \n \nwhether authorizing the applicant to enter would result in the \nreunion in Canada of the appellant with close family; \n \nthe strength of the relationship between the applicant and the \nappellant;\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n \n \nthe degree to which the applicant is established abroad; \n \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated the potential to adapt \nto Canadian society; \n \nwhether the parties to the application have obligations to one \nanother based on their cultural background; \n \nwhether the applicant is alone in their country; \n \nthe availability of health services to the applicant in Canada and \nabroad (for refusals based on medical grounds); \n \nwhether there is evidence of rehabilitation or the risk of the \napplicant re-offending (for refusals based on criminal grounds). \nHearings \nIAD hearings are de novo and therefore not limited strictly to reviewing \nthe evidence that led up to the refusal or removal order. In Kahlon v. \nCanada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), (1989) 7 Imm. \nL.R. (2d) 91; 97 N.R. 349 (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal \nestablished that the IAD must hear the whole case and consider any \nadditional facts brought to its attention. \nEvidence \nThe IAD has broader powers regarding the admission of evidence than \nregular courts since it is not bound by any legal or technical rules of \nevidence [A175(1)c)]. During a hearing, the IAD may receive, and \nbase a decision, on evidence it considers credible or trustworthy in the \ncircumstances, even if the strict rules of evidence have not been met \nby either party to the proceedings. \nDecisions \nThe IAD may dispose of an appeal by allowing it or dismissing it. In the \ncase of an appeal against a removal order, the IAD may also direct \nthat the enforcement of the order be stayed for a set period of time, \nwith conditions attached [A68]. Stays are sometimes granted by the \nIAD in cases where the residency obligation has not been complied \nwith. These stays can be seen in files where a removal order has been \nissued at a port of entry but can also apply to cases against a decision \nmade outside Canada on the residency obligation when a member \nauthorizes their return to Canada for their hearing. IRPA requires the \nIAD to impose mandatory conditions specified in R251 as well as any \nother conditions that it considers necessary. The IAD can reconsider a \ndecision to stay a removal order at any time. A reconsideration  of a \nstay may be initiated either by application by the appellant or the \nMinister’s counsel or on the IAD’s own initiative. [IAD rule 78 & 79] \n \nWhere the Minister is successful in appealing a favourable decision \nmade by the Immigration Division, the IAD may make or stay the \nremoval order that the member of the Immigration Division did not \nmake.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n \nA decision that is delivered orally at a hearing takes effect when the \nmember states the decision. A decision made in writing takes effect \nwhen the member signs and dates the decision [IAD rule 104]. \nReasons \nThe IAD is required to provide written reasons for all decisions \nregarding an appeal by a sponsor and for decisions that stay a removal \norder. For all other decisions, the person concerned or the Minister of \nIRCC or Minister of PSEP may request written reasons [IAD rule 103]. \n \n \n7. Procedure: General hearing \n \n7.1. Calculating time limits \n \nThe Interpretation Act governs the calculation of time limits in federal statutes, regulations and \nrules: \n \nPursuant to subsection 27(2) of the Interpretation Act, when a statute refers to a number of \ndays (not clear days) between two events, officers will exclude the day on which the first event \nhappened and include the day on which the second event is to occur. When the time limit for the \nperformance of a required action expires or falls on a holiday, the action may be performed on \nthe next workday after the holiday. Pursuant to sections 26 and 35 of the Interpretation Act, \nSundays are holidays, Saturdays are not. \n \nFor example, if there is a 15-day limit to appeal a decision made on June 2, the count begins on \nJune 3 and ends on June 17. Holidays are not left out in counting up to the 15th day. June 17 \nwould therefore be the last day to file, unless it were a Sunday, in which case, June 18 would be \nthe last day. If June 17 is a Saturday and the office is closed, then the appeal must be filed on \nJune 16. \n \n7.2. Withdrawing an appeal (IAD rule 94) \n \nAn appellant may apply in writing to the IAD to withdraw their appeal. Should the IAD determine \nthat withdrawing the appeal would likely have a negative effect on the integrity of the IAD \nDivision, it may determine that the withdrawal is an abuse of process and refuse to allow the \nappellant to withdraw their appeal. \n \nIf an appeal is withdrawn before the record is prepared or distributed, it is not necessary to \ndistribute the record. \n \nWhen a decision is received from the IAD indicating that an appeal has been withdrawn, the \nGlobal Case Management System (hereinafter “GCMS”) “Appeals” screen and National Case \nManagement System (NCMS) should be updated by the hearings officer.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n7.3. Reinstating an appeal after withdrawal (IAD rule 95-96) \n \nAn appellant may apply to the IAD to reinstate an appeal that has been withdrawn. The \napplication must conform to the IAD Rules for applications and include the appellant’s address \nand telephone number. The IAD may reinstate the appeal if it is satisfied that it failed to observe \na principle of natural justice or that it is in the interest of justice to do so [IAD rule 96]. \n \nIf an appeal is reinstated by the IAD, the decision must be entered in GCMS and NCMS by the \nhearings officer. \n \n7.4. Proof document was provided (IAD rule 25) \n \nA written statement stating how and when the documents were provided to the other party must \naccompany all applications, documents and records of appeal filed with the IAD. A sample \nstatement of service is attached in Appendix D. \n \n7.5. Applications to reopen an appeal \n \nA foreign national who has not left Canada under a removal order may make an application to \nthe IAD to reopen their appeal. The IAD may grant the application and reopen the appeal only if \nit is satisfied that it failed to observe a principle of natural justice [A71]. \n \nThe IAD does not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal once the deportation order has been \nexecuted. [Corpuz Ledda v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 14; Ramkissoon v \nCanada (MCI); [1978] 2 FC 290 (FCA); Canada (MCI) v Toledo, [2000] 3 FCR 563 (FCA). The \npowers conferred upon IAD under IRPA (sections 66-69, 71) with respect to removal order \nappeals refer to possible action before the enforcement of the deportation order. The IRPA does not \nconfer power for the IAD to take any action in cases where the deportation order has been enforced. \nAs such, the IAD does not have jurisdiction to re-open an appeal if the foreign national who filed an \napplication to re-open has been removed before their application is determined by the IAD. \n \nHearings officers should strongly oppose any application to reopen unless they are satisfied there \nwas a breach of natural justice that merits the appeal being reopened. Hearings officers should \nfile a motion on the ground that the IAD has no jurisdiction against any application to reopen \nwhere the foreign national has already been removed from Canada. \n \nPlease note the following section of operation bulletin PRG-2017-67 as it pertains to attempts to \nre-open appeal hearings: \n \nAttempts based on Tran (Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 \nSCC 50), 2017 SCC 50) to reopen final ID or IAD decisions where a determination of \ninadmissibility has been made, a removal order issued, and all avenues of appeal and/or judicial \nreview exhausted can be opposed by the hearings officers on the basis of the doctrine of res \njudicata. The purpose of the Operational Bulletin (hereinafter “OB”) is to direct the regions to  use \nres judicata in the present context where the law has changed and where we do not want all\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nindividuals who received valid removal orders at the time they were issued to re-litigate post \nTran. \n \n7.6. Applications \n \nThe IAD Rules specify that unless the IAD Rules provide otherwise, requests made to the IAD \nmust be made in an application in writing [IAD rule 84,85]. Applications may also be made \norally at a proceeding. Procedures for applications made orally at an appeal will be determined \nby the IAD at the proceeding. \n \nApplications made in writing must: \n \n \nstate the decision that the applicant wants the IAD to make; \n \ngive reasons why the IAD should make the decision; \n \nstate whether the other party agrees to the application; and \n \ninclude any evidence that the applicant wants the IAD to consider when it renders its \ndecision. \n \nEvidence included with an application must be in the form of a statutory declaration or affidavit \n[IAD rule  85(3)]. This rule, however, does not apply to applications to change the location of a \nhearing or the date or time of a hearing or applications to reconsider the appeal, where a stay of \nremoval has previously been granted. \n \nWritten applications must first be provided to the other party and then filed at the IAD registry \nwith a written statement indicating how and when the other party w as provided with the \napplication. The sample statement of service (Appendix D) may be used to meet the proof of \nservice requirement. \n \nSome examples of requests that must be made by way of application are: \n \n \nrequests to change the location of a proceeding IAD rule 88(1); \n \nrequests for non-disclosure of information (A86) \n \nrequests to change the date or time of a proceeding IAD rule  90; \n \nrequests to change or extend time limits; \n \nrequests to hold a hearing in the absence of the public IAD rule  93; and \n \nrequests to withdraw or reinstate an appeal IAD rules94,95. \n \nResponses to written applications must be in writing [IAD rule 86(1) ]. A written response must \ninclude the same information as noted above for the application. The response must be filed with \nthe IAD no later than seven days after the respondent receives the application [IAD rule 86(5)  \nAn applicant may reply in writing to the response no later than five days after they have received \nthe response. [IAD rule 87(3) ]. \n \nWhen an application is received, it should be reviewed to determine whether it has merit and \nwarrants the Minister’s consent or should be opposed.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nWhen an application is filed or received, the “Application” screen of NCMS should be completed \nby the hearings officer showing that an application has been initiated. All events in the \napplication process should be entered into NCMS. \n \n7.7. Loss of appeal rights \n \nA64 specifies the circumstances under which a foreign national, their sponsor or a permanent \nresident loses their right of appeal. If a foreign national or permanent resident is determined by \nan officer or the Immigration Division to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human \nor international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality, they do not have a right to \nappeal to the IAD. \n \nSerious criminality—Term of imprisonment of 6 months or more for a crime that was \npunished in Canada or crime described in paragraph A36(1)(b) or (c) [A64(2)]. \n \nIn order for the loss of appeal rights to apply on grounds of serious criminality, the person must \nhave received a sentence of 6 months or more for a crime punished in Canada or must have \nbeen found inadmissible for a crime described in A36(1)(b) or (c). In cases where there has been \ntime served, i.e., pre-sentence custody, the officer must verify the credit given by the criminal \ncourt sentencing judge for the pre-sentence custody by reviewing the criminal court transcript as \ntime spent in pre-trial detention may form part of a term of imprisonment for the purpose of \nA64(2). Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Atwal, 2004 FC 7. It is important \nthat officers gather information as to the actual sentence served. When calculating the total \nsentence imposed, it is imperative that the sentence be calculated to the day and not rounded \noff to the month as the repercussion of meeting the 6 months threshold is the loss of a right of \nappeal. (R. v. Wust, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18, para. 44 and 45). A sentence of 6 \nmonths is considered 183 days of imprisonment. \n \nA64(2) is not meant to include multiple, consecutive sentences. It refers to only a single \nsentence. As a result of the SCC decision in Tran, a conditional sentence order is not considered \na term of imprisonment for the purposes of A64(2) [Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and \nEmergency Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50]. \n \nMisrepresentation \n \nIf a sponsored application for permanent residence is rejected based on a finding of \ninadmissibility on grounds of misrepresentation, there is no right of appeal. However, this \nprovision does not apply if the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse, common-law partner or \nchild [A64(3)]. \n \n7.8. Non-disclosure of information: Prior to an appeal hearing \n \nThere exists some information in the possession of the Minister that should not be disclosed to \nthe IAD or to the other party. Different sources of information may be received by the public, the \napplicant, the sponsor, law enforcement, or other government departments.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nThe methods available to the Minister to protect this information include: \n \n \na valid privilege over the information (common law public interest privilege, informer \nprivilege) \n \nan application for non-disclosure (A86) \n \nthe security certificate regime (A77) \n \nredacting irrelevant portions of a document \n \nnot relying on a document (when the Minister is not under an obligation to disclose all \ninformation) \n \nFor the purposes of the production of an appeal record, the Minister must first determine if the \ntip needs to be included in the record. Then, the Minister must take steps to determine if the tip \nneeds to be redacted from the appeal record and finally, decide on which method is best suited \nto protect this information. \n \nFor guidelines on non-disclosure of information [A86] and protecting information, see ENF 31 \nand the Hearings Fundamentals Manual. \n \n7.9. Non-disclosure of information: During an appeal hearing \n \n \nshould the Minister’s counsel present a written application for the non-disclosure of \ninformation [A86], the IAD member adjourns the hearing. The IAD member determines \nwhether section 86 proceedings apply. \n \nFor guidelines on non-disclosure of information [A86] and protecting information, see ENF 31. \n \n7.10. Pre-hearing conferences \n \nWhen officers enter into an undertaking with counsel and the IAD at a pre-hearing conference, it \nmust be detailed in writing on the file. For example, if the Minister’s counsel agrees on a \nstatement of facts, concedes on certain issues or undertake to take specific actions, it must be \nclearly noted on file. \n \nWhere one officer has entered into an undertaking, any officer who subsequently has \nresponsibility for that appeal is bound by the undertaking made by the previous officer unless \nnew information supports a change in position. \n \n7.11. Liaison with the Department of Justice \n \nIRCC and the CBSA’s Legal Services must be the primary source of legal advice to IRCC and the \nCBSA respectively to ensure uniform advice and to keep IRCC and the CBSA senior officials \ninformed of new or unexpected issues. \n \nThe office concerned should inform the Hearings Program as early as possible of appeals \ninvolving important Charter questions or issues that could have a potentially serious impact on \nthe immigration program and the interpretation of the legislation. IRCC or the\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nCBSA will consult Legal Services to decide if assigning a Department of Justice lawyer to the case \nis warranted. \n \nWhen the hearings officer requires urgent assistance in relation to an upcoming IAD hearing, \nthey should consult their Justice Liaison Officer (JLO) who may request the assignment of \ncounsel by contacting the Legal Issues Coordination Group (LICG) at \nLICG_Litigation_Assignments@justice.gc.ca with a copy to the Hearings Program (Hearings- \nAudiences-Programs@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca), and the CBSA Judicial Review Unit (JRU) (CBSA-\nASFC_SecurityLitigationManagement-Gestiondeslitigessécurité <SLM-GLS@CBSA-\nASFC.GC.CA>) for questions under the responsibility of the Minister of PSEP or the Hearings \nProgram and the IRCC Litigation Management Branch (LMB) for questions under the \nresponsibility of the Minister of IRCC. \n \n7.12. Applications for judicial review \n \nWhere the officer who represents the Minister before a Division of the IRB believes that there are \nor may be grounds to seek judicial review, the officer will immediately consult their manager or \nthe regional CBSA Justice Liaison Officer, subject to local procedures, to discuss the possibility of \nseeking judicial review of the decision. If the manager agrees that judicial review should be \npursued, the hearings officer must do the following: \n \n(a) immediately request the reasons for decision from the Board; and \n(b) within five business days of the decision, determination, order, etc., being made, send, \nthrough the regional CBSA Justice Liaison Officer, a report to the Director of Litigation \nManagement Branch (LMB) at IRCC or the Manager of Judicial Review (JRU) at the \nCBSA. The report is to be transmitted by electronic means. \n \nOfficers should also keep in mind the very strict time limits involved when seeking judicial \nreview. The 15 days for serving and filing the leave application with respect to a decision of the \nBoard is calculated from the giving of notice of the decision or from the sending of written \nreasons, whichever is later pursuant to A169(f). \n \nIn order for NHQ to correctly calculate the date for filing, the request for judicial review must \nclearly indicate the date that IRCC or the CBSA became aware of the decision and the date the \ndecision was sent by the Board. Once IRCC LMB or the CBSA JRU agrees to seek judicial review, \nimmediate instructions will be issued to the Department of Justice to file the appropriate \ndocumentation with the Court. Should IRCC LMB or the CBSA JRU disagree with the \nrecommendation for judicial review, IRCC or the CBSA office will be provided with a rationale for \ntheir decision. The rationale can be provided by JRU/LMB or the JLO depending on the reasons \nand discussions can take place to clarify certain points. \n \nNote: In situations where an application is required to be filed with the Court on an urgent basis \nin order to preserve the Minister’s rights, the decision to seek judicial review may be made at the \nregional level. The IRCC Director of LMB or the CBSA Manager of JRU will be notified as soon as \npossible thereafter. Officers should refer such requests to the regional CBSA Justice Liaison \nOfficer after they have obtained concurrence from their manager.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nNote: See ENF 9, Judicial Review, for further information. \n \n \n7.13 Post hearing procedures \n \nWhen the hearings office concerned receives notice of the IAD’s decision and reasons, the GCMS \nand NCMS “Appeals” screens are to be completed promptly. \n \nIf the IAD allows the appeal and the hearings officer, in consultation with their supervisor and \nJustice Liaison Officer, believes that an application for leave and judicial review of the decision is \nwarranted the hearings office should follow the procedures for the Judicial review outlined in \n7.12. \n \nIf the C&I Minister applies for leave to begin an application for judicial review of the IAD decision \nallowing a sponsorship appeal, further processing of the visa application by the officer is stayed \nuntil the leave and judicial review application are disposed of by the courts (Federal Court \nFederal Court of Appeal and or/ the Supreme Court). If leave is granted, further processing of \nthe visa application is stayed until the courts have finally disposed of the matter, or until the \ntime limits for filing the application for judicial review or appeal have elapsed. \n \nIf the IAD allows the appeal, refers the matter back for reconsideration and the Minister does not \nfile an application for leave to apply for judicial review of the decision, the case is returned to the \nresponsible IRCC office for reconsideration in accordance with the IAD’s decision [A70(1)]. \n \nFor sponsorship appeals, in addition to uploading the decision and reasons into GCMS, the \nhearings office should also include any new evidence that was established at the hearing. If the \nMinister consented to the appeal, the IRCC office is given a full explanation of the reasons for the \nMinister’s consent. \n \nA70(1) obliges an officer to respect the decision of the IAD in re-examining an application. \nHowever, the officer must review the application to determine whether the application meets all \nother requirements of eligibility and admissibility. Sponsors and applicants are exempt from any \nrequirements that the IAD has set aside in its decision. In rare cases, if there are new grounds of \nineligibility or inadmissibility, or grounds that were not assessed in the first decision, the \napplication may be refused again. \n \nNote: To ensure that IRCC offices do not process applications where an application for judicial \nreview has been made on sponsorship appeals, hearings offices must inform IRCC that an \napplication for judicial review of the IAD decision is pending\n22 August 2024  \n \n8. Procedure: Family class sponsorship appeals \n \nIRCC has the policy responsibility for family class sponsorship and the Minister of IRCC is the \nrespondent (as of today the official name of the Ministry had not changed to IRCC and as such \nuntil it does change, the style of cause is to remain Minister of Citizenship and Immigration). \n \n8.1. Family class sponsorship appeals \n \nIf a Canadian citizen or permanent resident files an application to sponsor a foreign national as a \nmember of the family class, and the application for a visa is refused, the sponsor may appeal the \nrefusal of the application to the IAD [A63(1)]. The sponsor must be informed of the reasons for \nthe refusal and of the right of appeal to the IAD. \n \nThere is no right of appeal to the IAD if the foreign national (applicant) is inadmissible on the \nfollowing grounds [A64(1), (2) and (3)]: \n \n \nsecurity, violating human or international rights;\n \nserious criminality with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by a term of \nimprisonment of at least 6 months or a crime that is described in paragraph 36(1)(b) or \n(c);\n \norganized crime; or\n \nmisrepresentation [unless the foreign national in question is the sponsor’s spouse, \ncommon-law partner or child A64(3)].\n \nDetails regarding loss of appeal rights and exceptions can be found in section 7.7 above. \n \n8.2. Notice of appeal \n \nTo file an appeal to the IAD under IRPA, the sponsor must submit a notice of appeal and the \nofficer’s written reasons for refusal to the IAD registry no later than 30 days after the appellant \nreceived the reasons for the refusal of the application [IAD rule 16(a)] \n \nThe IAD will then provide the notice of appeal and written reasons for refusal to CBSA who \nrepresents the Minister of IRCC in sponsorship appeals. \n \n8.3. Designated representative \n \nIf counsel for the appellant or Minister believes the IAD should designate a representative for the \nsubject of the appeal because they are under 18 years of age or unable to appreciate the nature \nof the proceedings, they must notify the IAD in writing. If counsel is aware of a person in Canada\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nwho meets the requirements to be designated as a representative, they must provide the \nperson’s contact information in the notice of appeal [IAD rule 43,44(1)] \n \n8.4. Grounds for appeal \n \nAn appeal to the IAD may be based on questions of law, fact, or mixed law and fact, a principle of \nnatural justice has not been observed or on the grounds that there are humanitarian and \ncompassionate considerations that warrant granting special relief under its equitable jurisdiction. \nThe definition of “humanitarian and compassionate considerations” in section 6 above elaborates \non the IAD’s equitable jurisdiction. \n \nIf the IAD determines that the applicant is not a member of the family class or that their sponsor \nis not a sponsor within the meaning of the Regulations pursuant to R130 or R117, it cannot \nexercise its equitable jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) factors \n[A65]. In other words, the IAD cannot consider H&C factors unless it is satisfied that the \napplicant is a member of the family class or the sponsor meets the requirements of the \nregulations. If an IRCC officer refused the application without deciding if the applicant is a \nmember of the family class, the IAD cannot consider H&C without first making a determination \non whether the applicant is indeed a member of the family class. For example, in the context of a \nspousal application the IAD would have to be satisfied that the marriage is legally valid and the \nrelationship is genuine (R4) [Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness v. Hagos, \nIMM 6378-11, April 20, 2012]. \n \nIn the absence of a determination made by an IRCC officer on whether the applicant is a \nmember of the family class, it is up to the IAD to consider the issue for the first time during the \nappeal, however this is not the best option. The hearing may be postponed to permit the \nhearings officer to reach out the visa office and request that they assess the relationship (OB \n396). \n \n8.5. Disputed appeal rights \n \nWhen a refusal is based on a determination that the sponsor has not filed their application in the \nprescribed manner as set out in R10, then an application to dismiss the appeal should be made \nto the IAD. Hearings officers should argue that the IAD does not have jurisdiction to hear the \nappeal because the sponsor has not made an application under the Act pursuant to R10. The \nissue of whether or not the sponsor is entitled to appeal to the IAD will be decided by the IAD. \n \n8.6. Preparation of the record \n \nThe IAD will notify the responsible IRRC office that an appeal has been filed and will request \nthat their file be forwarded to the CBSA Hearings office. The IAD will copy the CBSA hearings \noffice with this request. Once the IRCC office has received the notice of an appeal, it will send \nthe IRCC  sponsorship file to the applicable CBSA hearings office as soon as possible. \n \nUpon receiving the notice of appeal and the file, the hearings office should:\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nensure that the GCMS and NCMS “Appeals” screens are completed promptly;\n \nenter any motions or applications associated with the appeal in the GCMS and NCMS.\n \n \nprepare the record, ensuring the documentation is complete and that it is legible and \nsuitable for presentation to the IAD. IAD rule 20(1) states that a record shall contain \na table of contents and the following documents:\no \nthe application for a permanent resident visa that has been refused; \no \nthe application for sponsorship and the sponsor’s undertaking; \no \nany document that the Minister has that is relevant to the application, to the \nreasons for the refusal or to any other issue in the appeal; and \no \nthe written reasons for the refusal. \n \nNote: Under IRPA, the IRCC officer is no longer required to prepare a statutory declaration. \nHowever, officers are required to record the rationale for their decision and this must be \nincluded in the record. \n \nThe CBSA hearings office must provide the appeal record to the appellant or their counsel and a \ncopy to the IAD. The copy of the appeal record provided to the IAD must be accompanied by a \nwritten statement saying how and when the appeal record was provided to the appellant [IAD \nrule 21(1) and (2)]. \n \nRecords must be received by the IAD no later than 60 days after the Minister receives a \ncopy of the written request from the Division to IRCC for the sponsorship file [IAD rule \n22(a)]. \n \n \nIf the IAD has not received the record within  60 days , it may take one of the following \nmeasures: \n \n \nrequire the Minister  to explain why the appeal record is late and give reasons \nwhy the appeal record should be accepted late; or\n \nschedule and start the hearing and decide the appeal without the appeal record \nor with only part of the appeal record.\n \nNote: It is important that a hearings officer review the IRCC office file immediately after receipt. \nThis review will allow officers to identify problems and opportunities to resolve the case without a \nhearing. Furthermore, early review of the visa file will allow the opportunity to add additional \ngrounds of refusal if necessary. \n \n8.7. Requirements to be eligible to sponsor \n \nR130 to R134 provide the requirements that a person must meet to be eligible to sponsor a \nrelative as a member of the family class. The Family Class Program Delivery Instructions (PDIs) \non assessing the sponsor provide further information on the legislative requirements to be met \nby the sponsor.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n8.8. Failure to meet financial criteria \n \nR134 provides procedures for calculating a sponsor’s ability to meet the minimum necessary \nincome (MNI) requirement. Financial requirements are specific to the type of family member \nbeing sponsored. \n \nAssessment of ability to meet this requirement for the sponsorship of a family member is based \non the last notice of assessment or equivalent document. Where the sponsor does not produce \nthe document or their income is less than the required amount, their income will be calculated \nbased on the income during the 12 months preceding the application. The date of the application \nis the date on which a complete family class application, including the processing fees, has been \nreceived at the CPC-Mississauga. Under R133(4), a sponsor is exempt from meeting MNI \nrequirements when they are sponsoring a spouse or partner or dependent child.  \n \nAmendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations that came into force on \nJanuary 1, 2014, made changes to the financial requirements for parents and grandparents. For \nthe sponsorship of parents and grandparents, the sponsor must meet the minimum necessary \nincome requirement (Low Income Cut-offs (LICOs) plus 30%) for each of the three taxation \nyears immediately preceding the date of their application. The Minimum Necessary Income must \nmeet or exceed the minimum necessary income requirement plus 30% on the date on which the \nsponsorship application is signed until the day the family members are granted status as \npermanent residents. \n \nThe ruling in the decision Nematollahi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2017 FC 755 has \nled the IRCC to review its interpretation of the Regulations concerning the three consecutive \ntaxation years immediately preceding the date the application to sponsor is received. The ruling \nhas an impact on applications to sponsor parents and grandparents that have been received \nsince 2014. Sponsors are encouraged to sign the statement of consent (question 8 on the \nFinancial Evaluation for Parents and Grandparents Sponsorship) and provide their Social \nInsurance Number (SIN) to allow the IRCC to collect their SIN and request their income tax \ninformation quickly from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to determine whether they meet the \nminimum necessary income requirements. This may be used in cases where the sponsor has \nsubmitted their application to sponsor at the beginning of the year and may not have filed their \ntaxes at the time of application or have still not received their Notice of Assessment for the \nprevious taxation year. If the sponsor does not provide their consent, they must complete the \napplicable form Income Sources for the Sponsorship of Parents and Grandparents and submit a \nNotice of Assessment issued to them by the CRA for each of the three taxation years \nimmediately preceding the date their application is received by the IRCC. If the sponsor does not \nhave paper copies of their Notices of Assessment on file, they may view and print their tax \nreturns as well as other personal tax information using the CRA’s My Account online service. \n \nSubsection 134(2) of IRPR provides officers with the authority to request updated evidence of \nincome from all sponsors who submit a sponsorship application for a member of the family class \nin the following circumstances:\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n \nthe officer receives information indicating that the sponsor is no longer able to fulfil the \nobligations of the sponsorship undertaking; or\n \nmore than 12 months have elapsed since the receipt of the sponsorship application.\n \nAppellants may submit new evidence of income relating to the period preceding the date of filing \nof their sponsorship application. In such cases, officers are required to take into account the new \nevidence of income in determining the IRCC’s position at the appeal hearing. \n \nHowever, officers should argue that evidence of income relating to the period that follows the \nreceipt of the sponsorship application is not a valid indication of a sponsor’s ability to meet the \nrequirements in R134 for authorization to sponsor. The IAD should not take such evidence into \naccount in deciding on the basis of a question of fact or law. Where the sponsor’s financial \nsituation has improved, the option to submit a new sponsorship application is available. \n \nThe ruling in the decision of Dokaj v. Canada (2009, FC847) has led the IRCC to review its \ninterpretation of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations concerning the adding of a \nco-signer to an existing family class undertaking. The Federal Court found that the IRCC could \nnot take into account the additional expenses incurred when adding a family member to the \nhousehold, such as a spouse or common-law partner, without also taking into consideration the \nincome that the individual brings to the household, if they have co-signed an undertaking. \nHenceforth, a co-signer can be added between the day on which the sponsorship application was \nfiled and the day on which a decision is made with respect to the application, if required, due to \na change in circumstances related to family composition. When assessing the sponsor’s income \nagainst the MNI requirement, both the increase in the MNI requirements resulting from the \naddition of a family member, and the co-signer’s income, calculated in accordance with R134(a) \nto (c) against the MNI in effect at the time, shall be considered. However, a co-signer may not \nbe added to the sponsorship application if the sponsorship was already assessed and at that \nassessment, the sponsor failed to meet the sponsorship requirements. \n \n8.9. Other sponsorship eligibility requirements \n \nSponsors are not eligible to sponsor if they are convicted of a sexual or violent offence against \nanyone, or for an attempt or a threat to commit such an offence, or if they are convicted of an \noffence causing bodily harm against certain members of their family, or for an attempt or a \nthreat to commit such an offence [R133(1)(e)]. \n \nIn addition, the sponsorship application shall only be approved if there is evidence that the \nsponsor is not in receipt of social assistance for a reason other than disability [R133(1)(k)]. \n \nSee the PDI on Permanent Residence , Family classes, Processing Applications to \nSponsor Members of the Family Class, for further information concerning the \nprocessing of applications to sponsor. \n \n8.10. Humanitarian and compassionate grounds related to sponsorship \n \nIf the IAD determines that the applicant is a member of the family class pursuant to R117 and\n22 August 2024  \n \nthat their sponsor is a sponsor within the meaning of the Regulations in R130, it can exercise its \nequitable jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) factors [A65]However, \nwhen a refusal is based on the fact that the sponsor has not met the minimum necessary income \nrequirement set out in R134 or is in default of a previous sponsorship as of the date that the \nundertaking was given, officers should argue that the fact that the sponsor would meet the \nrequirements if the current situation were taken into consideration does not constitute, in itself, \nsufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds. \n \nHearings officers should argue that, for an appeal to be allowed in equity, the decision must be \nbased on factors other than an improvement in the sponsor’s financial situation or the fact that the \nsponsor is no longer in default. Officers should ask the IAD to note that the sponsor had the option \nof taking a refund of the processing fee or proceeding with their application, knowing it would be \nrefused because they did not meet the requirements at the time. Otherwise, allowing persons who \ndid not meet the regulatory requirements during the specific time frame to sponsor a member of \nthe family class negates the effect of the Regulations. \n \nSee the PDI on Permanent Residence, Family classes, for more information. \n \n8.11. Bad faith marriage [R4(1)] \n \nThe IAD will consider a refusal by the IRCC office in order to determine whether section R4(1) is \napplicable, thereby excluding the applicant as a member of the family class. A “bad faith” or \n“non-genuine” relationship pursuant to R4(1) is present when either a relationship is not genuine, or it \nwas entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act. This \ncreates a disjunctive relationship between the “genuineness” and the “purpose” of the bad faith \nassessment. This clarifies that a finding of bad faith can be made if either of these elements is present. \n \nTherefore, the wording of subsection 4(1) of the Regulations is unambiguous; a finding \nof bad faith can involve either a finding that the marriage was entered into primarily for \nthe purpose of immigration or that the marriage is not genuine. This interpretation was \nconfirmed by Chief Justice Paul Crampton in Gill v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2012 FC 1522. \n \nWhen conducting the file review in preparation of the appeal, it is important to be cognizant of the \nlegal framework within which sponsorship appeals are considered. In assessing whether a \nmarriage/common law relationship/conjugal relationship was entered primarily for the purpose of \nacquiring status or privilege or whether the marriage was genuine, the IAD must take into \nconsideration the totality of the evidence on the balance of probabilities standard. Since the hearing is \na de novo hearing, the IAD’s role is to evaluate all of the evidence gathered up to the hearing so as \nto determine whether section 4(1) of the Regulations applies. \n \nFurther instructions are available under the PDI (Program Delivery Instructions) – identifying a \nrelationship of convenience.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nOther important guidance established in jurisprudence: \n \n \nThe appeal to the IAD is a de novo appeal, in which the IAD must consider afresh \nwhether the person sponsored as a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner is a \nmember of the family class. Singh Sandhar v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n2013 FC 662;\nThe relevant time to assess the marriage’s genuineness is the present, while the relevant \ntime to assess the primary purpose of the marriage is in the past, i.e., at the time of the \nmarriage. Singh v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1077; \n \nThe first part of the test requires an assessment of whether the marriage “was entered into \nprimarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act”. In assessing \nwhether the test is satisfied, the focus must be upon the intentions of both parties to the \nmarriage at the time of the marriage. The Federal Court has recognized that the testimony \nof the couple parties regarding what they were thinking at that time typically will be the \nmost probative evidence regarding their primary purpose for entering into the marriage. Gill\nv. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1522; \n \nA finding that a marriage is genuine weighs “significantly in favour of a marriage that was \nnot entered into for the purpose of gaining status in Canada”. However, the finding that a \nmarriage is genuine is not determinative of the primary purpose. Sandhu v. Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 834;\n \nEvidence of commitment subsequent to the marriage can be used to prove the primary \npurpose of the marriage. This might include evidence of a continuing relationship or the \nbirth of a child. However, such evidence is not necessarily determinative. Gill v. Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1522; Sandhu v. Canada (Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2014 FC 834;\n \nThe Board, must be careful about imposing western or Canadian paradigms on non- \nwestern culture. Nadasapillai v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 72;\n \nThe birth of a child is not determinative, however in assessing whether a marriage is \ngenuine great weight must be afforded to the birth of a child. Gill v. Canada (Citizenship \nand Immigration), 2010 FC 122.\n \n8.12. New relationship [R4.1] \n \nAn applicant may be refused under Regulation 4.1 if they were previously in a prescribed \nrelationship with their sponsor, but dissolved it primarily for immigration purposes. Section 4.1 is \ndiscussed at some length in Chapter 5 of the IRB’s guideline on Sponsorship Appeals. According \nto this document, the intent of Section 4.1 has been stated to be “to prevent persons in a \nconjugal relationship from dissolving the relationship to free them to gain admission to Canada \nonly to turn around and resume their previous relationship” (Harripersaud, Janet Rameena v. \nM.C.I. (IAD TA3-11611), Sangmuah, 2005). \n \nIn Wen, Chun Xiu v. M.C.I. ((IAD TA5-14563), MacLean, 2007), the IAD set out a list of non- \nexhaustive factors to consider when assessing the applicability of section 4.1 of the Regulations, \nincluding: \n \n \nWhen the relationship dissolved; \n \nThe reason for the dissolution of the relationship;\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n \nThe temporal relationship between the ending of the relationship and the forming of a \nnew relationship with the subsequent partner; \n \nEvidence that the former spouses or partners did not separate or end contact with each \nother; \n \nthe intent of the spouses or partners upon re-establishing their relationship; \n \nthe length of the subsequent relationship; \n \nthe temporal connection between the dissolving of the subsequent relationship and the \nre-establishment of a new relationship with the previous spouse or partner, and; \n \nthe intentions of the parties to the new relationship with respect to immigration. \n \nIt is clear from the cases of Wen and Harripersaud, as well as the IRB’s guidelines that section \nR4.1 only applies to situations involving the reunion of two parties who previously separated \nprimarily for immigration purposes. For greater clarity, “the dissolution of a conjugal relationship \nbetween two persons and a subsequent resumption of a conjugal relationship between these two \npersons to facilitate immigration constitutes an act of bad faith.” Further instructions is available \nunder the PDIs Identifying a relationship of convenience, under the section “Conjugal \nrelationships—Dissolutions of convenience”. \n \n8.13. Sponsors residing in provinces under federal-provincial \nagreements [A8(1) and A9(2)] \n \nIf a sponsor resides in a province that has sole responsibility for establishing and applying \nfinancial criteria for sponsors under a federal-provincial agreement [A8(1)], the sponsor has no \nright of appeal to the IAD on any ground of law, fact or mixed law and fact when both of the \nfollowing circumstances exist: \n \n \nthe application is refused based on the rejection of the person's application for \nsponsorship by an official of that province on the grounds that the person failed to meet \nthe financial criteria or to comply with any prior undertaking concerning the sponsorship \nof any application for permanent residence and\n \nthe laws of that province provide the person with a right to appeal the rejection of their \napplication for sponsorship.\n \nNote: The sponsor can still appeal on humanitarian and compassionate grounds [A9(2)] and \nhave a Certificat de Sélection du Québec (CSQ) issued by the Ministère de l’immigration, de la \nDiversité et de l’inclusion (MIDI). If the appeal is allowed, the visa office can reopen the \nprocessing of the application but the sponsor residing in Quebec would still need to meet the \nMIDI’s financial requirements. A refusal by the MIDI can be appealed with the Tribunal \nadministratif du Québec (TAQ) and the sponsor can provide them with the positive decision from \nthe IAD. The visa office can also contact the MIDI directly and provide them with the IAD \ndecision for the issuance of a CSQ. \n \nAt present, Quebec is the only province with such an agreement.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n8.14. Members of the family class \n \nThe definition of member of the family class includes spouses, common-law and conjugal \npartners, dependent children (including adopted children), children to be adopted, parents and \ngrandparents, some orphaned relatives under 18 and certain other relatives in specified \ncircumstances. A12(1), R116 and R117 specify who is a member of the family class. \n \nThe age for dependent children is under 22 years old according to the definition found in R2 \n \n8.15. Filing evidence \n \nInformation and documents must be submitted in a form suitable for presentation to the IAD, \nsuch as a statutory declaration or the interviewing officer's reasons or GCMS notes recording the \ninformation or identifying the documents received. Officers' declarations should contain facts, not \nopinions or conclusions, and should clearly indicate that the person making the declaration is an \nofficer. \n \nDocuments must be filed with the IAD no later than 60 days after the day on which the party \nreceives the appeal record. [IAD rule 26] with a written statement saying how and when the \ndocuments were provided to the other party[IAD rule 25].  \n \nNew information may be received in the form of a report, with appropriate documentation, from \nan officer in Canada or abroad who has become aware of new information concerning an \nappellant, such as marriage, the birth of a child, hospitalization, a criminal conviction or \nreliance on social assistance. \n \nThe IRCC office may forward information to the officer that it has used in assessing a sponsored \napplication for permanent residence. If such evidence was obtained in confidence from the \ngovernment or an institution of a foreign state, or an international organization of states and \ncannot be released publicly, the Minister may make an application for non-disclosure of \ninformation to the IAD. The grounds for the application will be that disclosure of such information \nwould be injurious to national security or the safety of persons. Procedures for applications for \nnon-disclosure of information are found in section 7.8 above. \n \n8.16. Consenting to an appeal—Communication with the IRCC office \n \nWhen a decision is made to consent to a sponsorship appeal, it is imperative that the hearings \nofficer inform the IRCC office of the reasons in writing. In order to assist the IRCC officers in \nidentifying ways to strengthen decisions and avoid potential trends from developing, lines of \ncommunication with the IRCC offices must be kept open.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \nShould the hearings officer notice a trend forming with particular types of refusals or refusals \nfrom a particular office, copies of the refusals in question should be forwarded to the Hearings \nPrograms Area at HQ (Hearings-Audiences-Programs@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) and Litigation \nManagement Branch, IRCC NHQ, e-mail to: IRCC.CMBLitigationMgmtRequest- \nDemandeGestLitigesDGRC.IRCC@cic.gc.ca with an overview of the scenario. Should a trend \ndevelop without being brought to the attention of the IRCC office and NHQ, the number of similar \nrefusals may increase. It is imperative that hearings officers and IRCC-NHQ work in collaboration \nwith processing offices and the processing networks (International Network, Centralized Network \nand Domestic Network), to ensure well-reasoned, consistent decisions that can be defended \nbefore the IAD. \n \n8.17. Authorization to return to Canada and refusal of permanent \nresidency application \n \nIn circumstances where a hearings officer is faced with the issue of an Authorization to Return to \nCanada (ARC) before the Board, Hearings Officers should argue that the IAD has no authority to \nissue an ARC. The issuance of an ARC in Canada is quite rare and has been delegated to the \nmanager or director levels in the IRCC and the CBSA for inland cases. Generally, a subject who is \nin Canada and requires an ARC is reported for non-compliance. It is the Minister’s jurisdiction to \nissue an ARC and should not be added as an issue before the Board. \n \nIAD has no jurisdiction to order the issuance of an ARC, regardless of whether a decision on ARC \nwas made by a visa officer. However, IRCC’s position is that when a visa officer refuses to issue \nan ARC and then refuses the PR application on that basis, the IAD has H&C jurisdiction to \novercome the inadmissibly underlying the ARC refusal, but it cannot order a visa officer to issue \nan ARC. \n \nRecent jurisprudence has supported the position that no appeal lies to the IAD from a decision to \nrefuse an ARC. [MOMI v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019, FCA 163] \n \n \n \n \n \n9. Procedure for appeals involving medical inadmissibility \n \n9.1. Overview of process for medical refusal \n \nIRCC has the policy responsibility with respect to medical inadmissibility [A38]. For further \nguidance on medical refusal procedures, please refer to the Program Delivery Instructions on \nMedical Requirements. \n \n9.2. Grounds for appeal \n \nThe IAD will normally deal with the issue of additional medical information w ith the appellant at\n22 August 2024  \n \nthe assignment court. This includes clarifying the grounds for appeal for which the information is \nintended to be used and setting time frames for providing the information. \n \nTo accelerate the processing of these appeal cases, the hearings officer should try to ascertain as \nsoon as possible the grounds for appeal to be used before the IAD, namely, whether there is a \nchallenge in law or whether it will be argued that there are compassionate or humanitarian \nconsiderations that warrant the granting of special relief, or both. \n \n9.3. When to consider a new medical examination during the appeal \nprocess \n \nWhere only compassionate or humanitarian considerations form the basis for the appeal, a new \nmedical examination should not be issued during the appeal process. In these cases, the \nhearings officer will simply need to consider requesting sufficient time between receipt of the  \nmedical information from the appellant and the hearing. During this time, the hearings officer \nwill seek the advice of Operations Directorate, Migration Health Branch, IRCC, NHQ, about the \nmedical information submitted, and to consider whether to introduce an opinion of a medical \nofficer as rebuttal evidence. \n \nWhere newly-submitted medical information is intended to challenge the decision in law, the \nappellant or counsel should be advised that the examining health-care professional consulted by \nthe applicant must refer to the medical notification of medical inadmissibility. Any health care \nprofessional’s report aimed at challenging the decision in law should expressly and clearly \naddress the issues raised in the medical notification, that is, diagnosis, prognosis and the issue \nof excessive demand on health and social services, and the issue of whether the health condition \nis likely to be a danger to public health and safety. Prior to agreeing to a postponement for \nobtaining this new medical information, the hearings officer will confirm that the applicant is \nwilling to undergo further medical examinations if a medical officer so recommends. \n \nIn considering the appropriate time frame for obtaining the medical information, the hearings \nofficer must be fair to the appellant and consider facilitating resolution without litigation, but \nwithout compromising IRCC’s interest in the finality of litigation. \n \nGenerally, IRCC will not support the consideration of more than one submission of new medical \ninformation from counsel once an appeal has been filed unless there is a genuine need to clarify \nthe evidence previously gathered by obtaining supplementary evidence. \n \n9.4. Procedures upon receipt of new medical information during the \nappeal \n \nWhen hearings officers receive new medical information about an applicant, they will reconfirm \nwith the appellant or counsel the purpose for which the information is being submitted, review \nthe new information and decide whether it should be forwarded to the Operations Directorate, \nMigration Health Branch, IRCC, at NHQ. Hearings officers must assess whether the information is \nrelevant and related to the applicant’s medical condition, as described in IRCC medical officer’s \nmedical assessment, namely, in terms of the diagnosis, the prognosis and the issue of excessive \ndemand on health and social services, and the issue of whether the health condition is likely to\n22 August 2024  \n \nbe a danger to public health or safety. In most cases, the information will be forwarded to the \nOperations Directorate, Migration Health Branch, IRCC, at NHQ. However, the new information \nshould not be forwarded to the Medical Services Branch if it clearly has no link with the reason \nfor refusing the applicant on medical grounds or if the medical information is so vague or of such \na general nature that it has little or no probative value. Instead, a date for hearing at the IAD \nshould be requested. (Examples are provided in Appendix B.) \n \nOn receipt of the new medical information, the Migration Health Branch, NHQ will transfer a copy \nto the medical officer abroad and inform both the relevant visa office and the hearings officer. \nThe hearings officer will inform the IAD and appellant or counsel in writing of the timing of this \ntransfer. The Migration Health Branch at NHQ and the medical officer abroad will review this new \nmedical information and jointly decide if the original medical assessment should be upheld or if a \nnew medical examination should take place because it appears that there is a change in the \nperson’s medical status. The medical officer abroad will then forward this decision directly to the  \nhearings officer, with a copy to both the visa office in charge of the case and the Migration \nHealth Branch at NHQ. The findings will read as follows: \n \nMedical officer X has reviewed the applicant’s entire medical file including the newly- \nsubmitted medical information that consists of [list what was reviewed about the \napplicant]. After completing this review, the medical officer upholds the original medical \nassessment. In this case, the hearings officer will proceed with the appeal before the IAD. \n \nor \n \nAfter completing this review, it is recommended that the applicant undergo a new medical \nexamination. The hearings officer will provide any direction required as to the requested \nmedical examination. \n \n9.5. New medical examination \n \nWhen medical officers recommend a new medical examination, the officer will contact the \napplicant within 30 days, request photographs within that time frame (where necessary) and \nissue new medical instructions. \n \nUpon receipt of a notice that a new medical examination is required, the applicant should either \nundergo the medical examination within 30 days or, alternatively, provide the officer with the \ndate of an appointment for the medical examination within 30 days. \n \nThe medical examination will be at the applicant’s own risk and expense. The applicant should be \nadvised that failure to comply within 30 days will lead IRCC to terminate the medical \nreassessment process. (Example letter provided in Appendix B.) \n \nAt the same time, the hearings officer will immediately inform the appellant or counsel in writing, \nwith a copy to the IAD that the applicant will be allowed to undergo a new medical examination. \nThe hearings officer will also advise the appellant or their counsel that it is their responsibility to \nensure the applicant complies with the officer’s instructions to forward passport-size photographs \nwithin 30 days and, if required, to undergo a medical examination or make an appointment for \nthe medical examination within 30 days of receipt of the new medical instructions. The hearings\n22 August 2024  \n \nofficer should notify the appellant or counsel that the applicant’s failure to comply within 30 days \nmay result in IRCC terminating the medical reassessment process. (Example letter provided in \nAppendix C.) \n \nIt is important for IRCC office to indicate, in GCMS, the date on which the new medical \ninstructions were sent out. If the applicant does not comply with the instructions, the officer will \nnotify the hearings officer, who will in turn inform the IAD and ask for a hearing date to be set, \nwith a copy of the request for a hearing date to the appellant or counsel. \n \nEach IRCC office should appoint a coordinator to ensure the follow-up of these cases by means of \na bring-forward (BF) system. The results of the new medical examination must be forwarded to \nthe hearings office as soon as they have been received. \n \nHearings offices should also use a BF system to follow up on these cases with IRCC offices, at a \nminimum every three months, with appropriate follow-up to IRCC offices where no action seems \nto have been taken. GCMS could be used for follow-up by those hearings offices that have \naccess. \n \nIRCC’s target time frame for the medical reassessment process is a maximum of nine months \nfrom the time IRCC office is informed that a new medical examination is required. \n \n9.6. Communicating medical results \n \nWhen the IRCC office receives the results of the medical officer’s updated medical assessment, it \nshall immediately forward them to the hearings officer, with a copy to the IAD. The IRCC officer \nmust pass on the results as soon as possible to permit the Department to meet the nine -month \nprocessing targets. \n \nWhere the re-examination reveals that the applicant is no longer medically inadmissible, there \nwill be no need to pursue the appeal, barring other non-medical grounds for inadmissibility. The \nappellant or counsel should be advised in writing that processing will continue once the appeal \nhas been formally withdrawn. Upon notification from the hearings office that the IAD has \nacknowledged receipt of the withdrawal of the appeal, visa officers can continue processing the \napplication for permanent residence. \n \n9.7. Medical officers’ statutory declaration \n \nThe specialized knowledge of a medical officer is important to hearings officers in properly \ndefending medical refusals before the IAD. Although it was the practice for medical officers to \nprepare statutory declarations when they were informed that a sponsor had appealed a refusal \non health grounds, medical officers can no longer systematically prepare statutory declarations \nfor all medical refusals. \n \nMedical officers may still be called upon in some cases to provide hearings officers with statutory \ndeclarations to establish the connection between the diagnosis and the conclusion that the \nperson’s coming to Canada might cause an excessive demand on health or social services, or is \nlikely to be a danger to public health or safety. To assist medical officers, hearings officers will \nhave to indicate clearly those points in the medical documents that require explanation. A\n22 August 2024  \n \nmedical record contains technical terms and specialized vocabulary that are not always easy to \nunderstand and interpret. To help and support hearings officers in this task, the Operations \nDirectorate, Migration Health Branch at IRCC, NHQ are available to answer questions from \nhearings officers and provide clarifications that could prevent additional delays. \n \nA statutory declaration can be requested in situations where the threshold of the proof can be \nvery demanding, for example, when a person suffering from intellectual disability is refused \nbecause their entry into Canada might cause excessive demands on social services. \n \nIn cases where the person’s state of health is very serious and it is recognized by the medical \ncommunity that a person suffering from this type of illness will require repeated access to health \nservices, hospitalization or major surgery, and the medical record as well as the medical \n \nnotification contain sufficient details, it is not necessary to request a statutory declaration. An \nexample would be a person suffering from metastatic malignancy, renal failure or AIDS. \n \nThe IAD has upheld inadmissibility based on health reasons in cases where clear evidence was \nprovided without a statutory declaration from a medical officer. \n \nAs of June 1, 2018, IRCC has issued a temporary public policy expanding the definition of \nexcessive demand. Please refer to IRCC’s PDIs for details on how this public policy may impact \nthe appeal. \n \n9.8. Effective communication \n \nCommunication is the key to ensuring that the set procedures are dealt with effectively. This \nmeans updating GCMS notes, bringing files forward on a regular basis and communicating with \neveryone involved in given cases, including the IRCC officers, medical services and hearings \nofficers. If established procedures are followed, the number of requests for updates received at \noffices and unnecessary litigation before the IAD will be reduced. More importantly, client service \nin the form of more timely decisions on complex medical appeals will result.\n22 August 2024  \n \n10. Alternative dispute resolution conference (ADR) [IAD rule 69(1)] \n \nThe IAD may require the parties to participate in an ADR conference in order to encourage \nthe parties to resolve an appeal without having recourse to a full hearing. \n \n10.1. Purpose of ADR \n \nADR IRP aims to empower parties to an immigration appeal to participate in the resolution of \ntheir case through the use of an informal meeting. This program is premised on the notion that \nlitigation is often not in the best interests of the parties and that some types of appeals could be \nprevented from proceeding to a hearing by applying ADR techniques. \n \nThe principal ADR method of attempting to resolve appeals is through a resolution process. An \nIAD-employed Early Resolution Officer (ERO) acts as dispute resolution officer and attempts to \nbring the parties to resolve the appeal. ADR cases are generally resolved by the sponsor \nwithdrawing their appeal or by Minister's counsel consenting to it. Alternatively, in unsuccessful \nresolution processes, the evidence and legal issues required at the hearing are often reduced as \na result of the early resolution session and a full hearing is scheduled to dispose of the appeal. \n \nIt is important to note that, as Minister's counsel, hearings officers possess the authority to make \ndecisions on behalf of the Minister of C&I or the Minister of PSEP when appearing at ADR \nsessions. \n \n10.2. Responsibilities of hearings officers for dispute resolution \n \nWhen \nResponsibility \nBefore and \nduring the \nADR session \nThe role of Minister's counsel is to represent the public interest and attempt to \nensure that justice is done. \n \nA crucial difference between the role of Minister's counsel in the hearings \nprocess versus the ADR process is that an ADR approach requires parties to \noperate in a proactive manner by searching for a resolution that will avoid a \nhearing. This does not mean that compromise is reached for the sake of \ncompromise. However, Minister's counsel must balance the need for program \nintegrity with efficiency. \n \nThis means ensuring that a resolution reached through ADR is consistent with \nthe principles of the IRPA, and IRCC or the CBSA policy. An approach that \nacknowledges statutory obligations and ADR values is one in which the \nMinister's counsel decides to consent to an appeal because it is recognized \nthat it is not in the public interest to litigate cases that have a poor chance of \nsuccess at a hearing.\n22 August 2024  \n \nPost-ADR \nIn appeal cases that are resolved at ADR, an IAD-issued Summary of \nAgreement of the Parties form is completed by the ERO. The Minister's counsel \nmust ensure that this form and any additional and relevant information \nrelating to the reasons for the ADR settlement of the case are forwarded to the \nappropriate IRCC office. It is acceptable to do this by e-mail in addition to \ninserting this summary of agreement in the file that will be returned to IRCC \nfor further processing. \n \nQuestions regarding the outcomes of individual appeals should be directed to \nthe hearings officer who acted as the Minister's counsel on the case. General \nquestions regarding the use of ADR in the appeals process may be forwarded \nto the CBSA Director of the Inland Enforcement Branch at NHQ.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n11. Procedure for removal order appeals \n \nThe CBSA has the policy responsibility with respect to the issuance of removal orders and the \nMinister of PSEP is the respondent in removal order appeals. \n \n11.1. Persons who may appeal against removal orders \n \nPursuant to A63(2) and A63(3), permanent residents, foreign nationals who hold a permanent \nresident visa and protected persons, may appeal against a decision at an examination or an \nadmissibility hearing, their removal order to the IAD . They may appeal not only on the basis of \nlegal and factual questions, but also on the basis that there are humanitarian and compassionate \nconsiderations that warrant granting special relief. \n \nAn appeal may be based on the grounds that the decision appealed is wrong in law, fact or \nmixed law and fact or that a principle of natural justice has not been observed or that sufficient \nhumanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the \ncircumstances of the case. [A67] \n \nA64 provides that no appeal may be made to the IAD by a foreign national, their sponsor or a \npermanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be \ninadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or \norganized criminality. Inadmissibility for serious criminality here refers to an offence punished in \nCanada by a term of imprisonment of at least six months or that is described in A36(1)(b) or \nA36(1)(c). \n \n11.2. Criminality \n \nInadmissibility provisions have been consolidated under IRPA such that provisions apply both \ninland and at the port of entry. For details on inadmissibility provisions, see ENF 1, \nInadmissibility, and ENF 2, Evaluating inadmissibility. \n \nSituations may arise where the appellant had convictions as a young offender, and evidence \nrelated to those convictions is important in establishing the Minister’s case. Under A36(3)(e), \ninadmissibility on the grounds of A36(1) or A36(2) may not be based on an offence under the \nYoung Offenders Act (YOA). The YOA was replaced by the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) \nwhich came into effect on April 1, 2003. A conditional sentence order (CSO) is not considered a \nterm of imprisonment for the purpose of 64(2). [Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness), 2017 SCC 50]. The SCC in Tran decided two main issues; 1) a conditional \nsentence order imposed pursuant to the regime set out in ss. 742 to 742.7 of the Criminal Code \nof Canada (CCC) does not constitute a “term of imprisonment” under paragraph 36(1)(a) of the \nIRPA and ; 2) the phrase “maximum term of imprisonment” in paragraph 36(1)(a) of the IRPA \nrefers to the maximum term of imprisonment available at the time of the commission of the \noffence and not the term of imprisonment available at the time of sentencing or the time when \nadmissibility is determined.\n22 August 2024  \n \nFor additional information, see ENF 14, Criminal Rehabilitation, OP 19, Criminal Rehabilitation \nand ENF 28, Ministerial Opinions on Danger to the Public and to the Security of Canada. \n \n11.3. All the circumstances of the case \n \nThe definition of “humanitarian and compassionate considerations” in section 6 above provides \ndetails of the test to be applied by the IAD when exercising its equitable jurisdiction. It also sets \nout the general factors the IAD considers when hearing removal order appeals. Removal order \nappeals differ from sponsorship appeals in that the IAD’s equitable jurisdiction includes the \npotential risk the appellant may face in their country of destination. \n \nThe Supreme Court ruled in Chieu v. M.C.I., [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84 and Al-Sagban v M.C.I., [2002] \n1 S.C.R. 133 that “all the circumstances of the case” may include foreign hardship, including the \nrisk that the individual may face, provided that the likely country of destination has been \nestablished. Based on the Supreme Court’s reasoning, it is highly likely that appellants will \nsubmit documentation regarding the human rights situation in the country of destination and \nother documentation related to risk at the appeal against their removal order. The Court has \nacknowledged that the Minister is entitled to have documents verified prior to the hearing o r to \nchallenge their validity. \n \nWithout a passport or travel document for a particular country, it is the CBSA’s position that \nthere is insufficient evidence to assume which will be the likely country of destination and foreign \nhardship should be considered only where the likely country of destination has been established. \n \nIf such documentation is necessary to determine the likely country of destination, the \ncircumstances in the country of destination at the time of removal cannot be certain. Where the \nappellant is serving a sentence or it can be established that the removal process is particularly \nlengthy, it will become even more difficult to anticipate country conditions at an uncertain point \nin the future. \n \nHearings officers should evaluate the circumstances of each case and, where appropriate, argue \nthat, in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish the likely country of destination or time  of \nremoval, anticipated risk or hardship cannot be properly evaluated. \n \nFurther, appellants will have an opportunity to apply for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) \nwhen they become ready for removal. Foreign hardship will be more accurately assessed at the \nright time through the PRRA process. Therefore, in some cases it will be appropriate for hearings \nofficers to submit that foreign hardship should be given little weight for these reasons. \n \n11.4. Mandatory conditions to be imposed by the IAD \n \nA68(2)(a) states that where the IAD stays a removal order: \n \n“it shall impose any condition that is prescribed and may impose any condition that it \nconsiders necessary.” \n \nMandatory conditions are found in R251 and are as follows:\n22 August 2024  \n \n251.… \n(a) to inform the Department and the IAD in writing in advance of any change in the \nperson’s address; \n \n(b) to provide a copy of their passport or travel document to the Department or, if they \ndo not hold a passport or travel document, to complete an application for a passport or a \ntravel document and to provide the application to the Department; \n \n(c) to apply for an extension of the validity period of any passport or travel document \nbefore it expires, and to provide a copy of the extended passport or document to the \nDepartment; \n \n(d) to not commit any criminal offences; \n \n(e) if they are charged with a criminal offence, to immediately report that fact in writing \nto the Department; and \n \n(f) if they are convicted of a criminal offence, to immediately report that fact in writing to \nthe Department and the Division. \n \nNote: Effective December 12, 2003, the portions of the Department of Citizenship and \nImmigration that deal with enforcement (removals, detention, investigations, hearings, appeals, \ninterventions) and war crimes were transferred to the Canada Border Services Agency. \nTherefore, the words “the Agency” should be read where the words “the Department” currently \nappear in the above-referenced section of the Regulations (R251). \n \nThe mandatory conditions shall be imposed in all stays of removal imposed by the IAD, whether \nthe removal order was based on criminal inadmissibility or for any other removal order appeal. \n \n11.5. Discretionary conditions in criminal inadmissibility cases \n \nThe IAD has discretionary power to impose non-prescribed conditions when it stays a removal. \nGenerally, these conditions are imposed in cases involving criminal inadmissibility and \nentrepreneur appellants. \n \nIn criminal inadmissibility appeals, conditions of a stay that are frequently imposed by the IAD \ninclude the following: \n \n \nprovide all information, the notice and documents required by the conditions of the  stay \nby hand, by regular or registered mail, by courier or priority post to the CBSA, at \n(address of the CBSA’s office) and to the IAD (address of the IAD and fax number) It is \nthe responsibility of the appellant to ensure that the documents are received by the \nAgency within any time period required by a condition of the stay. \n \nreport to the CBSA on the dates set by the IAD, or the first of the month in a sequence \nchosen by the IAD. The appellant shall report in person, in writing or by telephone. The \nreports are to contain the following details: \no \nemployment or efforts to obtain employment, if unemployed;\n22 August 2024  \n \no \ncurrent living arrangements; \no \nmarital status, including common-law relationships; \no \nattendance at meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, or any other drug or alcohol \nrehabilitation program; \no \nother relevant changes of personal circumstances (i.e. separation, \ndivorce, children). \n \nmake reasonable efforts to seek and maintain full-time employment and immediately \nreport any change in employment to the Agency. \n \nnot knowingly associate with individuals who have a criminal record or who are engaged \nin criminal activity, except contact that might result while attending meetings of \nAlcoholics Anonymous, or any other drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \nnot own or possess offensive weapons or imitations of offensive weapons. \n \nrespect all parole conditions and any court orders. \n \nrefrain from the use of alcohol. \n \nkeep the peace and be of good behaviour. \n \ntake immediate steps to repay any and all debts owed to creditors. Provide proof of \nrepayment schedule and compliance at each time of reporting to the Agency. \n \nfollow or continue to follow a psychotherapy program if the probation officer sees the \nneed. (If appellant withdraws consent to this condition, they must forthwith make an \napplication to the IAD to have this condition removed.) \n \nengage in or continue anger management counselling with (name of therapist or group). \n \nrefrain from the illegal use or sale of drugs. \n \nmaintain the payment schedule as foreseen in the agreement with the Municipal Court. \n \nDiscretionary conditions depend on the nature of the appellant’s situation, which will have been \nestablished during the hearing before the IAD. They can be suggested by the Minister’s counsel \nand the appellant, but the IAD decides which conditions will be imposed. \n \nThe burden rests on the appellant to demonstrate that the conditions have been met; however, \nthe CBSA’s hearings office will monitor whether the appellant complies with the mandatory and \ndiscretionary conditions imposed with the stay in order to report, when required, to the IAD. See \nsection 11.7 below. \n \n11.6. Monitoring compliance with the conditions of a stay of removal \n \nWhere the IAD has stayed a removal order, it may, at any time, on application or on its own \ninitiative, reconsider the appeal [A68(3)]. \n \nThe Minister or the appellant can apply to the IAD to reconsider the appeal [IAD rule 78(1)]. The \napplicant must follow IAD rule 85 for applications generally, but evidence is not required in an \naffidavit or a statutory declaration. However, a written statement of whether the subject of the \nappeal has complied with the conditions of the stay must be provided with the application. \n \nWhen the IAD provides notice that it may reconsider an appeal in which it stayed a removal \norder, both parties must immediately provide the IAD with a written statement concerning \ncompliance with the conditions of the stay of removal [IAD rule 78(2)]. \n \nThe statement of the Minister’s counsel must indicate the information the Minister has\n22 August 2024  \n \nconcerning compliance with the conditions of the stay and should indicate what decision the IAD \nshould make when reconsidering the appeal [IAD rule 78(2) or 79(2) and 86(1)].Where a \nremoval order on the grounds of criminal inadmissibility has been stayed, verification of \ncompliance with the conditions imposed by the IAD is the CBSA’s responsibility. When a date is \nscheduled by the IAD for a review, a report indicating compliance, or default, with the conditions \nshall be prepared with a recommendation to the IAD. Such a recommendation may be to: \n \n \nallow the appeal, cancel the stay and quash the removal order; or \n \nmaintain the stay for an extended period of time with additional conditions, or removal of \nconditions which have been met; or \n \ndismiss the appeal. \n \n11.7. Cancellation of stays by operation of law \n \nA68(4) provides that a stay is automatically cancelled by operation of law and the appeal \nterminated where a person who was found inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or \ncriminality is granted a stay of removal and is then convicted of another offence described in the \nserious criminality provisions of A36(1). \n \nWhere a stay is cancelled by operation of law, hearings officers must send the appellant a notice \nin writing regarding cancellation of their stay (see Appendix E). A copy of the notice must also be \nsent to the IRB with a statement of service [IAD rule 80 and 81]. \n \n11.8. Permanent resident visa holders \n \nAs outlined in manual chapter ENF 4, section 12.2, border services officers may prepare a report \nunder subsection A44(1) if they establish that a foreign national in possession of a permanent \nresident (PR) visa is inadmissible. The PR visa holder may later be issued a removal order as a \nresult. \n \nUnder A63(2), a foreign national who holds a permanent resident visa may appeal to the IAD \nagainst a decision to make a removal order against them. \n \nIf the appeal on the removal order is allowed, A67(2) provides that the IAD shall set aside the \noriginal decision and substitute a determination that, in its opinion, should have been made, \nincluding the making of a removal order, or refer the matter to the appropriate decision-maker \nfor reconsideration. If the foreign national arrived at the point of entry while the PR visa was \nvalid and the examination was deferred pursuant to section A23, the foreign national can be \ngranted PR status as per R71.1. \n \nAs the permanent resident visa holder will likely be in Canada following the IAD decision, the \nhearings officer must return the case to the closest local IRCC office in Canada, and not return \nthe file to a migration office overseas. \n \nPursuant to A70(1), the responsible IRCC office is bound by the IAD’s decision. Officers should \nread the IAD’s decision and reasons in order to determine next steps in processing. These cases \nshould be processed on a priority basis as the PR visa holder may be have been without status \nfor some time. The IRCC office must follow the following procedures depending on the IAD’s\n22 August 2024  \n \ndecision: \n \n \nIf the IAD sets aside the original decision and refers the matter to a decision- \nmaker for reconsideration, the responsible IRCC office must re-open the application, \n \nupdate background verifications and ensure the foreign national is not inadmissible to \nCanada before granting permanent residence. \n \nIf the IAD’s decision is to allow the individual to remain in Canada, the \npermanent resident application should only be re-opened to grant permanent resident \nstatus. The individual may be granted permanent resident status even if the permanent \nresident visa expired, provided they initially appeared for examination and presented \ntheir permanent resident visa within its period of validity. Given the passage of time, the \nresponsible IRCC office may update background verification of the applicant if there are \nconcerns there may be new grounds that could make the applicant inadmissible to \nCanada. \n \nIn both cases, family members that were not previously examined and were added to the \napplication following the IAD’s decision must provide any required forms and documents, \nand complete a medical examination to allow the IRCC officer to assess their eligibility \nand admissibility.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n12. Procedure: Loss of residency status appeals \n \nIRCC has the policy responsibility with respect to loss of residency status and the Minister of \nIRCC is the respondent in these appeals (as of August 3, 2018, the official name of the Ministry \nhas not changed to IRCC and as such until it does change, the style of cause is to remain \nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration). \n \n12.1. In Canada \n \nPermanent residents who are determined by the Minister’s delegate to have lost their permanent \nresident status have the right to appeal their removal order against the Minister of IRCC \npursuant to A63(3). Persons in this category are subject to the same appeal provisions as \npermanent residents who are ordered removed on other grounds of inadmissibility. \n \nFor more information, see section 11. \n \n12.2. Outside Canada \n \nPursuant to A63(4), permanent residents may appeal to the IAD, against the Minister of IRCC, \nwith respect to a decision made outside Canada on the residency obligation under A28. IAD rule \n13(1)(c), 16(c) and the IAD Appeal form  require that: \n \n \nthe notice of appeal be filed with the IAD of the region in Canada where the appellant last \nresided; \n \nthe written reasons for the loss of status decision be filed with the notice of appeal; \n \nif the appellant wants to return to Canada for the hearing of the appeal, they must \nindicate it on the notice of appeal; and \n \nafter they receive the written reasons for the decision, appellants have 60 days to file \nwith the IAD a notice of appeal and the written reasons for the decision. \n \nWhen the notice of appeal is received, the hearings office should: \n \n \nensure that the GCMS and NCMS “Appeals” screens are completed promptly; and \n \nenter any motions or applications associated with the appeal in the GCMS appeals screen. \n \n12.3. Record of refusal (outside Canada) \n \nIAD rule 20(4) requires that the Minister prepare an appeal record that includes a table of \ncontents and the following documents: \n \n \nany documents the Minister of IRCC has that is relevant to the decision on the \nresidency obligation or any issue  in the appeal; and \n \nthe officer’s written decision and written reasons. \n \nAll parties must receive the appeal record and proof of compliance no later than 60 days after\n22 August 2024  \n \nthe Minister has received the notice of appeal. \n \n12.4. Requests to return to Canada for the hearing (Outside of Canada) \n \nA31(3)(c) provides that a permanent resident shall be issued a travel document if: \n \n \nthey were physically present in Canada at least once in the last 365 days; and \n \nthey have made an appeal under A63(4); or \n \nthe period for making an appeal has not expired. \n \nThe situation will arise where permanent residents who do not meet the residency requirement \nrequest a travel document during the 60-day appeal period although they have not filed an \nappeal. Persons in this situation would be allowed to enter Canada during the 60-day appeal \nperiod even if they have not yet filed an appeal. In cases such as this, the port of entry will \nnotify the hearings office. Hearings offices should monitor the file to determine if an appeal is \nfiled. When an appeal is not filed within the 60-day period, the file should be referred to the \nCBSA for investigation. \n \n \nApplications must be filed with the IAD and the Minister without delay after the notice of appeal \nis filed. If the IAD is satisfied the presence of the permanent resident at the hearing is \nnecessary, it will order that the permanent resident physically appear at the hearing. Where the \nIAD has ordered that the appellant be physically present, an officer shall issue a travel document \nfor that purpose [A175(2)]. \n \n12.5. Dismissed appeals—Type of removal order \n \nA69(3) requires that where the IAD dismisses an appeal under A63(4) and the permanent \nresident is in Canada, it shall make the removal order. Neither the Act nor the Regulations \n \nspecify what type of removal order should be issued by the IAD. To ensure consistency with \nprocedures in cases involving the in-Canada determination of residency obligation, hearings \nofficers should request that the IAD issue a departure order for failure to comply with the \nresidency obligation [R228(2)]. \n \n12.6. Failure to appear at an appeal \n \nIf an appellant fails to appear for their appeal, hearings officers should ask the IAD to declare  the \nappeal abandoned pursuant to A168(1). If the person concerned is subject to a removal order, \nthis order will then come into force and they will be removable from Canada. Where an appellant \nwas determined to have lost their residency status outside Canada, and the person concerned \nhas returned to Canada for their appeal, officers should ask that the IAD issue the appropriate \nremoval order in absentia.\n22 August 2024  \n \n13. Procedure: The Minister's appeal rights \n \nIf a member of the Immigration Division decides at an admissibility hearing that the person \nconcerned is not a person against whom a removal order should be made or, that the person \nmay be granted authorization to enter Canada, the Minister of PSEP may appeal that decision to \nthe IAD on questions of law or fact, mixed law and fact, or on question of a breach of a principle \nof natural justice. [A63(5) and A67(1)]. \n \nThe decision to appeal an Immigration Division decision to the IAD is made at Litigation \nManagement (LMB), NHQ, or CBSA Judicial Review Unit (JRU), by persons with delegated \nauthority from the Minister. When the Minister decides to appeal, Litigation Management will: \n \n \nserve a notice of appeal on the respondent and the IAD within 30 days after \nthe day on which the Minister receives the Immigration Division's decision \n[IAD rule 16(d)]; \n \nsend a copy of the material to the appropriate hearings office and advise the hearings \nofficer supervisor where the decision was made; and \n \nThe Immigration Division must provide the Minister and the IAD with a certified true copy of \nthe record no later than 30 days after the IAD receives the notice of appeal [IAD rule 22(b)]. \n \nWhen the Minister begins an appeal, Litigation Management (LMB) NHQ or CBSA Judicial \nReview Unit (JRU), will complete the GCMS appeals screen. If the Minister or the respondent \nbegins a motion or application, hearings officers are responsible for completing the “Motions” \nscreen in GCMS. \n \nA69(2) – In the case of an appeal by the Minister respecting a permanent resident or a \nprotected person, other than a person referred to in subsection 64(1), if the Immigration Appeal \nDivision is satisfied that, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the \ndecision, sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light \nof all the circumstances of the case, it may make and may stay the applicable removal order, or \ndismiss the appeal, despite being satisfied of a matter set out in paragraph 67(1)(a) or (b). \n \nAfter the IAD renders its decision, the hearings office promptly updates the GCMS “Appeals” or \n“Motions” screens and the NCMS screens, as the case may be. This is particularly important \nwhen the IAD issues a removal order. In those cases, the officer completes the appropriate \nremoval order by hand and forwards the CBSA's copy of the order to the appropriate office. \n \nIf the IAD dismisses the Minister's appeal and the officer, in consultation with their supervisor, \nbelieves that an application for judicial review of the decision is warranted, the officer should \nimmediately bring the decision to the attention of Litigation Management(LMB) NHQ or CBSA \nJudicial Review Unit (JRU). The documents may be e-mailed to: \nIRCC.CMBLitigationMgmtRequest-DemandeGesLitigesDGRC.IRCC@cic.gc.ca (See ENF 9, Judicial \nReview). \n \nIn addition, in dismissed appeals, the officer should make a written request for the  written \nreasons.\n22 August 2024  \n \n \n14. Procedure: Roles and responsibilities \n \nRole \nResponsibilities \nIRCC and CBSA’s \nLitigation Management \nThe Litigation Management Branch (LMB), situated in the Case \nManagement Branch, NHQ, and the  CBSA Judicial Review Unit \n(JRU) , NHQ share responsibility for the management of all the \nIRCC and the CBSA cases involving litigation in the Federal Courts \nand for ministerial appeals before the Immigration Appeal Division \npursuant to A63(5). Litigation Management (LMB) will determine \nwho should manage the case and they will refer certain cases to \nCBSA Judicial Review Unit (JRU) that fit within the JRU mandate. \n \nSee ENF 9, Judicial Review, for more information. \nHearings officer \nHearings officers present cases in accordance with policies and \nfunctional direction from either the IRCC Admissibility Branch, or \nthe CBSA Inland Enforcement Program Management Division at \nNHQ. \n \nThe role of a hearings officer as the Minister’s counsel is to \nensure that the integrity of the system is upheld and that justice \nis served. In most circumstances, this requires the hearings \nofficer to defend the decision of an officer not to issue a visa, or \nthe decision of a Minister’s delegate or the Immigration Division \nto issue a removal order. \n \nExceptions may arise where the original decision is not defensible \ndue to an error in law or fact or due to a breach of natural justice. \nOfficers should consent to an appeal being allowed only when the \ncircumstances of the case merit the original decision being \noverturned. Due to the de novo nature of IAD hearings, hearings \nofficers will often have different evidence to consider and present to \nthe IAD than that considered by the original decision-maker. New \nevidence is often introduced through documentation at the hearing. \n \nIt is essential that hearings officers be familiar with the IAD Rules \nas they govern procedures such as disclosure, preparation of the \nrecord and procedures at IAD hearings. \n \nWhen the hearings office concerned receives notice of the IAD’s \ndecision, the GCMS and NCMS “Appeals” screens are to be completed \npromptly. \n \nHearings officers represent the Minister of IRCC or the Minister of \nPSEP in proceedings before all Divisions of the IRB. Hearings officers \nhave direct contact with counsel and clients. They should always be\n22 August 2024  \n \nprofessional in both decorum and appearance. Hearings officers \nshould maintain their professionalism in their telephone manner, \nwritten correspondence, conduct at hearings and all other \ninteractions with the public. Professionalism should be exhibited by \nproperly preparing for cases and treating all participants at a \nhearing with dignity and respect. The participants include members, \ncounsel, witnesses, interpreters and observers, if any. \nLegislative and \nRegulatory Policy \nDivision, Admissibility \nBranch, IRCC, NHQ. \nThe IRCC Director of the Legislative and Regulatory Policy Division at \nNHQ is responsible for all admissibility policies except security, war \ncrimes and organized crime.
