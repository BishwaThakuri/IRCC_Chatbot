Since interventions, cessations, and \nvacations are an important instrument for ensuring the integrity of the program, it is essential that a clear \nand understandable framework be established for them. \n \nWith the introduction of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) Ministerial Reviews and \nInterventions pilot project in October 2012, senior immigration officers are delegated to effect reviews and \ninterventions at the IRB. IRCC ministerial interventions are restricted to cases involving program integrity \nand credibility as well as cases where exclusion pursuant to article 1E of the United Nations Convention \nand Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention) arises. \n \nThe Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will continue to intervene in cases involving serious \ncriminality, security concerns, war crimes, crimes against humanity, or acts contrary to the purposes and \nprinciples of the United Nations (UN). The CBSA will be responsible for hybrid cases (i.e., where there are \ncombined program integrity/credibility issues and criminality or security concerns). Where the case is \ndetermined to be a hybrid case and, due to various circumstances, where the Minister of Public Safety \nand Emergency Preparedness (PSEP) elects not to pursue the case on the grounds of criminality or \nsecurity, the CBSA has made a comittment to IRCC to go forward on credibility or program integrity \ngrounds where warranted. The CBSA also has responsibility for detention cases, all arguments under the \nCharter of the United Nations (UN Charter), and designated foreign nationals. \n \nThis chapter provides guidance for hearings officers and all officers who process refugee protection \nclaims. \n \n2 Program objectives \n \nThe Ministerial Intervention Program has the following objectives: \n \n \nensure that individuals who are major criminals or who are compromising national security do not \nenjoy the benefit of Canada’s protection; \n \nensure that the Refugee Protection Program is fair and that protection is offered to those \nindividuals who need it; \n \nhelp ensure the integrity of the refugee protection determination system; \n \nprovide as much information as possible to the IRB in cases involving refugee protection \nclaimants; \n \nfoster the development of expertise concerning international instruments and case law pertaining \nto refugees; and \n \ndevelop durable partnerships with internal, external, national, and international partners who \nshare the same objectives. \n \nIRCC and the CBSA have in place a joint triage system to ensure that there is no duplication of work and \nthat all claims are screened for possible intervention. Three triage centres have been set up to perform \nthe joint triage process as follows:\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n7 \n \n \n \nCBSA Montréal triages all claims for the Atlantic, Quebec and Northern Ontario Regions; \n \nIRCC Toronto triages all claims for the Greater Toronto Area and the Southern Ontario Region; \nand \n \nCBSA Vancouver triages all claims for the Prairies and Pacific Regions. \n \nIRCC and CBSA refugee intake officers are required to scan all intake documents, including the Basis of \nClaim (BOC) form, the appropriate IMM008 form, the Schedule A form, and officer notes, if applicable, \nand send them through the electronic sharing folder to the triage office closest to where the RPD hearing \nwill be held. Once CBSA and IRCC officers have access to the Global Case Management \nSystem (GCMS), all these documents will be downloaded in GCMS instead of being sent through the \nelectronic sharing folder. \n \nIntake officers should flag cases of interest for possible intervention through the Field Operational Support \nSystem (FOSS) and GCMS. For more details on the triage process, refer to section 9.2 of this manual \nchapter. \n \nNote: The priorities and strategies stated in section 5.4 of this manual chapter have been established by \nnational consensus and reflect the objectives of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), \nwhich are to promote justice and security by denying access to Canadian territory to persons, including \nrefugee protection claimants, who are security risks or serious criminals. \n \nWith these priorities, hearings officers can clearly identify cases that require their attention, where they \nmust take action on a priority basis. The strategies will guide hearings officers in dealing with various \ntypes of cases and will standardize interventions at the national level while preserving the integrity of the \nintervention program. \n \nThe procedures identified in section 9 of this manual chapter concern the internal operational perspective \non case management. These procedures have the following objectives: \n \n \nreduce case preparation time; \n \nstandardize regional practices; \n \nfacilitate the exchange of information among the regions; and \n \nensure more effective monitoring of operational case management while maintaining the highest \nlevel of quality. \n \n3 The Act and Regulations \n \nNote: References to the IRPA appear in the text with an “A” prefix, followed by the section number. \nReferences to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) appear with an “R” prefix, \nfollowed by the section number. \n \n3.1 The IRPA \n \nSection A3 specifies the objectives of the Act with respect to refugees. Some of these objectives are to \n \n \nfulfil Canada’s international legal obligations with respect to refugees; \n \ngrant fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming persecution;\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n8 \n \n \n \nprotect the health and safety of Canadians; \n \nmaintain the security of Canadian society; and \n \npromote international justice and security by denying access to Canadian territory to persons, \nincluding claimants, who are security risks or serious criminals. \n \nAccording to section A3, the Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that complies with \ninternational human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory. See Appendix A for a list of \ninternational instruments on human rights to which Canada is a signatory. \n \nTable 1 below summarizes the provisions of the IRPA that are applicable to refugees and to persons in \nneed of protection in the context of interventions led by the CBSA. \n \nTable 1: Legislative provisions concerning the protection of refugees \n \nFor information on \nRefer to section(s) \nThe right of the Minister of PSEP or IRCC to intervene at the RPD \nA170 \nDefinition of refugee protection \nA95(1) \nDefinition of protected person \nA95(2) \nDefinition of person in need of protection \nA97 \nDefinition of Convention Refugee \nA96 \nExclusion from the definition of refugee or of person in need of protection A98 \nApplication for refugee protection \nA99 \nEligibility of refugee protection claim \nA100 and A102 \nGrounds of ineligibility \nA101 \nSuspension of a refugee protection claim by the RPD \nA103 \nNotice of ineligibility at the RPD \nA104 \nExtradition procedure \nA105 \nUndocumented claimants \nA106 \nDetermination on refugee claims by the RPD \nA107(1) \nNo credible basis \nA107(2) \nDetermination of manifestly unfounded refugee claims (MUC) by the RPD A107.1 \nCessation of refugee protection \nA108, A40.1 \nVacation of refugee protection \nA109, A40(1)(c) \nDesignated countries of origin by Minister (DCO) \nA109.1 \nAppeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) from the RPD \nA110 \nLoss of permanent resident status \nA46 \nInadmissibility standard of proof \nA33 \nInadmissibility for security reasons \nA34 \nInadmissibility for violation of human or international rights \nA35 \nInadmissibility for serious criminality \nA36 \nInadmissibility for organized criminality \nA37 \nInadmissibility report \nA44 \nAdmissibility hearing by the Immigration Division \nA45, A172 and A173 \nPre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) \nA112 to A116 \n \nThe IRPA deals with the IRB in Part 4, sections A151 to A186 inclusively.

During \nthe process, the IRB member may receive and base a decision on evidence the \nmember considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances, even if the strict \nrules of evidence have not been met. \nDesignated country of \norigin (DCO) \nDCOs are countries designated under subsection A109.1(1) by the Minister that \ndo not normally produce refugees but do respect human rights and offer state \nprotection. The current list of DCOs can be found at Designated countries of \norigin \nDesignated foreign \nnational (DFN) \nA DFN is a person that the Minister may designate, pursuant to section A20.1 \nhaving regard to the public interest, as an irregular arrival in Canada. \nBalance of probabilities Balance of probabilities means that it is more probable than not, or more likely \nthan not, that the alleged facts have occurred or are true. \nBurden of proof \nBurden of proof is the onus of establishing a fact or facts in dispute between \nparties. \nRes judicata / issue \nestoppel \nRes judicata / issue estoppel is a matter that is already judicially decided. If the \nissue actually and directly in dispute has been adjudicated on, it cannot be \nlitigated again. However, a prior judgment between the same parties is not \nstrictly res judicata because it is based on a different cause of action and \noperates as an estoppel only in regard to matters actually at issue. \nManifestly unfounded \nclaim (MUC) \nRPD decision makers have the obligation to identify in their decisions that a \nparticular claim is manifestly unfounded if they are of the opinion that the basis \nof the claim was clearly fraudulent (A107.1). Individuals whose claim is \nidentified as manifestly unfounded do not have the right to appeal to the RAD \npursuant to subparagraph 110(2)(c). \nStandard of proof \nStandard of proof is the degree to which the decision maker must be satisfied. \nFor example, the standard of proof for article 1F of the Refugee Convention is \n“serious reasons for considering,” which is lower than “the balance of \nprobabilities.” \n \n4 Instruments and delegations \n \n4.1 Members of the IRB: Powers and authorities \n \nMembers of the IRB have the powers and authority of a commissioner and may do anything they consider \nnecessary to provide a full and proper hearing [A165]. This includes the power to receive in evidence any\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n11 \n \n \nrelevant information, whether adverse or not, and to question the refugee protection claimant about any \nmatter concerning their application. \n \n4.2 The right of the Ministers of PSEP and IRCC to appear before the \nRPD \n \nThe Ministers of PSEP and IRCC have the right to be represented in all matters before the RPD, to \nproduce evidence, question witnesses, and make representations [A170]. The Ministers of PSEP and \nIRCC may exercise these rights by appearing in person at hearings or by filing evidence or written \nrepresentations with the RPD if the panel authorizes filing of representations. \n \nIn representing the Minister, hearings officers must abide by the provisions of the RPDR, in particular \nregarding intervention notices and the time limit for disclosing evidence. \n \n4.3 Authority of the hearings officer during a ministerial intervention \n \nHearings officers have delegated authority to represent the Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as \nthe case may be, at hearings before the IRB (refer to IL3, Designation of Officers and Delegation of \nAuthority). \n \n4.4 Finding of ineligibility: Powers delegated to the Immigration \nDivision or to the Minister \n \nThe IRPA allows the Immigration Division or the Minister of PSEP, as the case may be, to make a \ndetermination of inadmissibility on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious \ncriminality, or organized criminality. Such a ruling results in the refugee protection claim becoming \nineligible [A101]. \n \n5 Departmental policy \n \n5.1 Hearings at the RPD: Regular hearing \n \nSection A170 stipulates that the RPD shall dispose of any matter before it by holding a hearing. Hearings \nbefore the IRB are conducted before a single membe,r unless the Chairperson thinks it necessary to form \na panel of three members [A163]. \n \nA person applying for refugee protection may be represented by counsel [A167]. \n \nA person claiming refugee protection is also entitled to an interpreter and may choose to have the hearing \nconducted in English or French (rules 17 and 19 of the RPDR). \n \nThe RPD must notify the Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as the case may be, of any matter \nbefore it and must give the relevant Minister an opportunity to produce evidence, to question witnesses, \nand to make representations in accordance with section A170 and rule 25 of the RPDR.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n12 \n \n \n5.2 Expedited process without a hearing \n \nAccording to section A170, the RPD may allow a claim for refugee protection without holding a hearing if \nthe Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as the case may be, has not notified the RPD of the \nintention to intervene within the time limit prescribed by rule 23 of the RPDR. In such cases, a case \nmanagement officer will conduct an interview with the claimant and will submit a recommendation to the \nmember. However, given the short timeframes, it is expected to be a rare occurrence. \n \n5.3 Nature of the refugee protection determination process \n \nWhen a ministerial intervention takes place, the refugee determination hearing changes from non- \nadversarial to adversarial. The hearings officer attends and conducts a thorough examination of the \nrefugee protection claim based on specific information contained in the CBSA’s or IRCC’s file in order to \nprovide the panel with a maximum amount of information. If a rigorous examination of the claim reveals \nreasonable grounds for opposing a refugee protection claim, the hearings officer objects to the claim on \nbehalf of the Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as the case may be. If the examination does not \nreveal arguments giving rise to opposition on the relevant Minister’s part, the hearings officer has the \nlatitude to withdraw from the case or to make representations accordingly. \n \nWhere the case is determined to be a hybrid case and the Minister of PSEP elects not to pursue the case \non grounds of criminality or security, the CBSA has made a comittment to IRCC to go forward on \ncredibility or program integrity grounds where warranted. \n \nIn addition to hybrid cases, special cases, including those dealing with Canadian Charter of Rights and \nFreedoms (Charter) arguments, all cases involving detainees, irregular arrivals (DFNs), international \nfugitives, high-profile cases, and cases with a security/criminality nexus will be handled by the CBSA. \nShould disagreements arise regarding the handling of a particular case, the case will default to the CBSA \nuntil resolution can be reached. \n \n5.4 CBSA priorities and strategies for hearings at the RPD \n \nWhen evaluating and sorting files, officers must keep the following priorities in mind to determine and \ndistribute their workload: \n \nTable 3: CBSA priorities and strategies for ministerial intervention cases \n \nPriority \nType of case \nStrategy (type of intervention) \nFirst priority \n \n \nCases involving security \nand criminality issues \n \nCases in which a member \nof the RPD requests the \nintervention of the Minister \nof PSEP \nCases where there may be a \nfinding of \n \n \n1F(a) exclusions \n \n1F(b) exclusions \n \n1F(c) exclusions \n \n(see sections 5.12, 5.13, 5.14 and \n5.15 below) \n \nConsider the option of \nobtaining an ineligibility \nruling leading to \ninadmissibility over the \nintervention option \n \nIntervention in person \n \nIntervention in person or \nby filing documents\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n13 \n \n \n \nSecond priority \n \n \nCases where the outcome \nwould have a very great \nimpact on the integrity of \nthe program \n \nCases that establish a \nnew trend in the \nmovement of persons that \naffect a large population of \nrefugee protection \nclaimants and that involve \nmisrepresentation or fraud \n \nCases that involve a single \nindividual with a particular \nprofile \n \nIntervention in person in \nthe initial cases and \nintervention by filing of \ndocuments thereafter, if \ncircumstances permit \n \nIntervention in person, \napart from exceptional \ncases \nThird priority \n \n \nCredibility cases that \ninvolve program integrity \nconsiderations but have \nless of an impact on the \nprogram as a whole \n \n1E exclusions and other \ncredibility cases (see \nsection 5.18 below) \n \nIntervention by filing of \ndocuments, apart from \nexceptional cases \n \nThe following is to be considered \nin choosing the type of \nintervention: \n \n \ncomplexity and credibility \nof the evidence; \n \nneed to obtain testimonies \nand to cross-examine; and \n \nimpact of the decision on \nfuture cases. \n \n5.5 Criteria for evaluating cases \n \nTo help officers determine the relevance of an intervention, certain criteria have to be evaluated. The \nfollowing tables contain indicators that help officers to evaluate cases and to make the most informed \ndecision possible regarding the appropriateness of making an intervention, whether by filing of documents \nor in person. \n \nTable 4: Factors to consider in cases not involving exclusion grounds set out in article 1F of the \nRefugee Convention \n \nIndividual factors \nFactors that influence the \nprogram \nFactors that influence illegal \nmovements and smugglers’ \nnetworks \nThe identity or nationality of the \nclaimant is cast into doubt (e.g., \nseizure of documents in the mail, \nchecking of fingerprints) or there \nare multiple identities. \nThe intervention will not unduly \ndelay the determination process. \nThe application for protection has \nresulted from human trafficking. \nThere are false statements or \ncontradictory statements regarding \nThe country of nationality is one of \nthe 10 most important source \nThe application for protection has \nresulted from the use of a\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n14 \n \n \n \nimportant aspects of the claim \n(e.g., declaration at port of entry, \nvisa application). \ncountries for refugees in Canada \nor is increasing in importance at an \naccelerated rate. \ndangerous or unconventional \nmeans of transportation to reach \nCanada. \nThere is a question of status in a \nsafe third country (e.g., visitor \nauthorization renewed for several \nyears). \nIn the region, the acceptance rate \nis higher than the national rate, \nand there is an explanation (e.g, \ndifferent profile of claimants in the \nregion compared to the rest of the \ncountry). \n \nThere is the possibility of removal. The issues to be resolved are \ncommon to a particular group of \nclaimants (e.g., arrival en masse of \nclaimants all alleging the same \nreasons). \n \nThere are other immigration \napplications in process that would \nallow the claimant to remain in \nCanada (e.g., sponsorship \napplication). \nThe application for protection \ncomes from an individual from a \ncountry that is exempt from the \nobligation to obtain a Canadian \nvisitor visa. \n \nThe claimant has a criminal record \nin Canada. \nThe CBSA has a policy on the \nbasis for the claim. \n \nThere are no acceptable \nidentification documents with no \nreasonable justification (e.g., the \nperson had status in a third \ncountry and had to submit \nidentification documents to obtain \nstatus). \nA question of legal interpretation is \nraised that might lead to an \napplication for judicial review (e.g., \ninterpretation of a legislative \nprovision). \n \nThere are sensitive, high-profile \nissues (e.g., child abduction case \npublicized in the media). \nThe information provided by the \nintervention mechanism will help \nprovide additional details \nconcerning the claim. \n \n \nTable 5: Particular factors to consider \n \nType of case \nParticular factors \nCases that establish a new trend \nin the movement of persons that \naffect a large population of refugee \nprotection claimants and that \ninvolve misrepresentation, fraud, \nor human trafficking \n \nThe number of refugee protection claims that are part of the \nmovement \n \nThe documentary evidence available on the subject \n \nThe existence of precedents in other regions \nVacation of a refugee protection \nclaim [A109] \n \nThe nature and importance of the false declarations or withholding \nof facts, taking the circumstances of the case into account \n \nDoes there remain enough evidence, among the pieces of \nevidence considered at the time of the initial decision, to justify \nretaining refugee protection?

It is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility \nbased on credible evidence [Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), \n[2005] 2 S.C.R. 100. par 114]. \n \nThis is a lower standard than the criminal standard of reasonable doubt. It is a bona fide belief in \na serious possibility based on credible evidence; and \n \n \nbeginning with Ramirez v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 2 F.C. 306, \nthe standard of proof at the RPD regarding exclusion under article 1F of the Refugee Convention \nis “serious reasons for considering”, which is equivalent to “reasonable grounds for believing.” \nThe Refugee Convention can be found at the UNHCR site. \n \nConsequently, a person does not have to have been convicted of a crime by a court for an exclusion \nclause to apply. The clause may also apply where a person has been found not guilty by a court due to \ninsufficient evidence (the standard is higher in criminal cases in a number of countries) or for other \nreasons, if it is possible to reach the standard of “reasonable grounds for believing.”\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n16 \n \n \nA refugee protection claimant who has been found inadmissible in or outside of Canada on grounds of \nsecurity, violating human or international rights, serious criminality, or organized criminality [A112(3)(a) \nand A112(3)(b)] or a claimant who has been refused protection under article 1F of the Refugee \nConvention [A112(3)(c)] may not obtain refugee status at the time of the PRRA in either case but may \nbenefit from a stay of the removal order [A114(1)(b) and A112(3)]. See PP 3, Pre-removal risk \nassessment. \n \nFailed refugee protection claimants are subject to a one-year bar (or three-year bar if the claimant is a \nnational from a DCO) on a PRRA following the final decision on their claim. However, vacated or \nexcluded claims are not subject to the PRRA bar [A112(2)(b.1)]. See PP 3, Pre-removal risk assessment \nfor further information. \n \nNote: If an officer thinks that a claimant may be inadmissible on security or serious criminality grounds, \nwhich would render the claim ineligible, and the officer determines it is better to pursue the admissibility \nhearing route (versus exclusion), the officer must follow the appropriate procedure. See ENF 5, Writing \nsubsection A44(1) Reports and ENF 6, Review of reports under A44(1). \n \n5.7 Suspension \n \nPursuant to section A103, a claim is suspended when a subsection 44(1) report has been referred to an \nadmissibility hearing on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality, \norganized criminality, or outstanding, serious criminal charges in Canada (refer to form BSF 528). \n \nSuspension before a claim is referred to the RPD \n \nThere are two circumstances where an officer can suspend the processing of a claim and delay the \neligibility decision, which is made typically within three working days. \n \nThe officer shall suspend the eligibility of the person’s claim if \n \na) a report has been referred for a determination, at an admissibility hearing, of whether the person \nis inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality, \nor organized criminality; or \nb) the officer considers it necessary to wait for a decision of a court with respect to a claimant who is \ncharged with an offence under an Act of Parliament that is punishable by a maximum term of \nimprisonment of at least 10 years [A100(2)]. \n \nSuspension after a claim is referred to the RPD \n \nSimilar to suspension prior to referral to the RPD, section A103 requires the RPD to suspend proceedings \nwhen notified by an officer that the case has been referred to the Immigration Division to decide whether \nthe claimant is inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious \ncriminality, or organized criminality. \n \nSuspension after the claim is referred to the RPD is required if the claimant is charged with an offence \npunishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years and the officer considers it necessary \nto wait for the court’s decision.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n17 \n \n \n5.8 Resumption of eligibility processing \n \nIf the Immigration Division determines that the person is inadmissible based on security, violating human \nor international rights, serious criminality, or organized criminality, then the claim should be determined \nineligible, and the RPD should be notified accordingly [A104 and BSF 529]. \n \nHowever, if the Immigration Division determines that the person is not inadmissible based on security, \nviolating human or international rights, serious criminality, or organized criminality, the Minister’s delegate \nshould make a determination of eligibility and notify the RPD accordingly [A103 and BSF 527]. \n \nIf the Minister is considering filing or has already filed an appeal pursuant to subsection A63(5), the officer \nshould notify the RPD. \n \nIn summary, if the \n \n \napplication for refugee protection has been referred to the RPD [A100], and if a report pursuant to \nsubsection A44(1) has been prepared and is referred to the Immigration Division for an \nadmissibility hearing, a notice pursuant to section A103 will inform the RPD that the claim for \nrefugee protection before them is suspended until a determination is made by the Immigration \nDivision; \n \nImmigration Division makes a finding of inadmissibility, section A104 provides that the \nproceedings before the RPD are terminated; consequently, the refugee claim is not eligible, and \nany proceedings before the RPD are thus terminated as though they never took place; or \n \nImmigration Division does not make a finding of inadmissibility, the refugee protection claim is \ncontinued on notice that the claim is eligible [A103], and the normal process for dealing with the \nclaim at the RPD continues. An officer shall reassess the case and determine whether an \nintervention is justified. \n \n5.9 Extradition \n \nIf an officer comes across a case that involves extradition procedures, the Case Management Branch at \nIRCC National Headquarters must be contacted. \n \nSubsection 105(1) suspension if proceeding under Extradition Act \n \nThe RPD and the RAD shall not commence or shall suspend consideration of any matter concerning a \nperson against whom an authority to proceed has been issued under section 15 of the Extradition Act \nwith respect to an offence that is equivalent to an offence under Canadian law that is punishable under an \nAct of Parliament by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years, until a final decision under the \nExtradition Act with respect to the discharge or surrender of the person has been made. \n \nSubsection A105(2) continuation if discharged under Extradition Act \n \nIf the person is finally discharged under the Extradition Act, the proceedings of the applicable division \nmay be commenced or continued as though there had not been any proceedings under that Act. \n \nSubsection A105(3) rejection if surrendered under Extradition Act\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n18 \n \n \nIf the person is ordered surrendered by the Minister of Justice under the Extradition Act and the offence \nfor which the person was committed by the judge under section 29 of that Act is punishable under an Act \nof Parliament by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years, the order of surrender is deemed \nto be a rejection of a claim for refugee protection based on article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. \n \nIf the person was already a Convention refugee or a protected person before extradition was requested, \nthe Minister of Justice, in deciding whether to issue the surrender order, must consider whether the \nconditions which led to the conferral of refugee status still exist. \n \nThe relevant time for considering the person’s ongoing entitlement to refugee protection and, therefore, \nprotection against refoulement and any change of conditions in the requesting state for the purposes of \nparagraph 44(1)(b) of the Extradtion Act is the time at which surrender is sought. \n \nIf a person is ordered surrendered under the Extradition Act, they are considered rejected based on \narticle 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. Refer to Németh v. Canada (Justice) 2010 SCC 56 [2010] 3 \nSCR 281 and Gavrila v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 57, [2010] 3 SCR 342. \n \nNote: Pursuant to paragraph A112(2)(a), persons under an authority to proceed issued under section 15 \nof the Extradition Act are not eligible for a PRRA. \n \nSubsection A105(4) final decision \n \nThe deemed rejection referred to in subsection A105(3) may not be appealed and is not subject to judicial \nreview except to the extent that a judicial review of the order of surrender is provided for under the \nExtradition Act. \n \nSubsection A105(5) Limit if no previous claim \n \nIf the person has not made a claim for refugee protection before the order of surrender referred to in \nsubsection A105(3), the person may not do so before the surrender. \n \n5.10 Deciding on process – intervention or admissibility hearing \n \nWhen determining whether or not to pursue an intervention at the RPD to exclude an individual from \nrefugee protection or to have the claim suspended under subsection A103(1) and referred to the \nImmigration Division for an admissibility hearing, officers may consider the following factors: \n \n \nIntervention at the RPD leading to \nexclusion pursuant to \narticle 1F(b) of the Refugee \nConvention \nSuspension of consideration of the \nclaim and referral to the Immigration \nDivision for an admissibility hearing \nBurden of proof \nThe burden of proof always rests \nwith the Minister. \nThe burden of proof rests with the \nperson concerned when the person has \nnot been legally authorized to enter \nCanada and with the Minister when \nentry was authorizied [A45(d)]. \nElements to be proven \nTo establish complicity, the \nTo establish complicity pursuant to\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n19 \n \n \n \n \nindividual must have made a \nknowing and significant contribution \nto the crime or criminal purpose of \nthe group alleged to have committed \nthe crime. \nparagraph A35(1)(a), it must be \nestablished that the individual \nvoluntarily made a knowing and \nsignificant contribution to the crime or \ncriminal purpose of the group alleged to \nhave committed the crime. \nClassified information \nEx parte hearings are not available. \nEx parte hearings are available in order \nto present classified information to the \ndecision maker. \nSerious criminality in \nCanada \nInterventions are not available for in- \nCanada convictions. The offence \nmust have taken place outside of \nCanada. \nPursuant to paragraph A36(1)(a), the \noffence must be punishable by a term of \nimprisonment of 10 years in order for \nthe claim to be ineligible [A101(2)(a)]. \nSerious criminality \noutside of Canada \nThe crime must be described in \narticle 1F(b) of the Refugee \nConvention. \nPursuant to paragraph A36(1)(a), the \noffence must be punishable by a term of \nimprisonment of 10 years in order for \nthe claim to be ineligible [A101(2)(a)]. \nPRRA \nThe individual is ineligible to make a \nclaim but is eligible for a full PRRA. \nRestricted PRRAs are restricted to \nsection A97 only. \n \nNote: Hearings officers must keep in mind that they may intervene at the RPD and seek exclusion, even \nif the Immigration Division has determined that there is no basis for a finding of inadmissibility. \n \n5.11 Highest priority: Cases involving security and criminality issues – \nExclusions under articles 1F(a), 1F(b), and 1F(c) of the Refugee \nConvention \n \nThe IRPA grants protection on the following three grounds, which are known as the consolidated \ngrounds: \n \n \nwell-founded fear of persecution based on a Refugee Convention ground [A96]; \n \ndanger of torture [A97(1)(a)]; and \n \nrisk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment [A97(1)(b)]. \n \nWhile recognizing the need to protect refugees, the Refugee Convention contains provisions under which \npersons who might otherwise be eligible for refugee status are excluded from the protection offered by \nthis status. The provisions of the Refugee Convention on exclusions have been incorporated into \nsection A98. \n \nSection A98 reads as follows: \n \nA person referred to in article 1E or F of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a \nperson in need of protection. \n \nArticle 1F of the Refugee Convention is included as a schedule to the IRPA and reads as follows: \n \nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n20 \n \n \nserious reasons for considering that: \n \n(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined \nin the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; \n(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his \nadmission to that country as a refugee; \n(c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. \n \nNo balancing required \n \nOnce it has been determined that an exclusion clause applies, there is no need to consider if the person \nis a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, and there is no requirement to balance the \nnature of the exclusion with the degree of persecution feared. \n \n5.12 Exclusion under article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention \n \nNote: For an in-depth analysis of exclusion under article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention, refer to \nENF 18, War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity. \n \nIn the matter of Ezokola v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 SCC 40, the Supreme Court of \nCanada (SCC) ruled that membership in an organization with a limited, brutal purpose is no longer \nsufficient for an individual to be excluded from refugee protection under section 1F(a) of the Refugee \nConvention. \n \nThe SCC established that an individual will be excluded from refugee protection under article 1F(a) of the \nRefugee Convention for complicity in international crimes if there are serious reasons for considering that \nthe individual voluntarily made a knowing and significant contribution to the crime or criminal purpose of \nthe group alleged to have committed the crime; this is also known as the contribution-based test. \n \nThe SCC indicated that other forms of liability, such as aiding and abetting and command/superior \nresponsibility, continue to be operative, and pre-Ezokola jurisprudence pertaining to these concepts \nshould continue to be used for this purpose. \n \nThe SCC also indicated that the guidance to apply the contribution-based test can be found in a number \nof factors, namely \n \n(i) the size and nature of the organization, including a limited, brutal purpose organization; \n \n(ii) the part of the organization with which the refugee claimant was most directly concerned; \n \n(iii) the refugee claimant’s duties and activities within the organization; \n \n(iv) the refugee claimant’s position or rank in the organization; \n \n(v) the length of time the refugee claimant was in the organization, particularly after acquiring \nknowledge of the group’s crime or criminal purpose; and\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n21 \n \n \n(vi) the method by which the refugee claimant was recruited and what kind of opportunitythey had \nto leave the organization. \n \nMost of these factors were already being applied by the IRB prior to Ezokola, either directly (factors i and iv–\nvi) or indirectly (factor ii), but factor iii is new and should be given due attention. \n \nNote: The contribution-based test to establish complicity as proposed by the SCC in Ezokola must also \nbe applied in the context of evaluating inadmissibility pursuant to paragraph A35(1)(a). \n \nWhen presenting arguments related to exclusions pursuant to article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention or \nparagraph A35(1)(a), the hearings officer must show how an individual meets the contribution-based test \nas established in Ezokola v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration). For case law pertaining to \narticle 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention, refer to Appendix B of this manual chapter. \n \nNote: The SCC decision on Ezokola does not impact evaluation of inadmissibility pursuant to \nsubsections A34(1) and A37(1) or paragraphs A35(1)(b) and A35(1)(c). Ezokola has also no impact on \nhow membership under paragraphs A34(1)(f) or A37(1)(a) is evaluated. \n \n5.13 Exclusion under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention \n \nThe primary purpose of this provision is to protect the population of the host country from a person who \nhas committed a serious non-political crime before being admitted to Canada. This provision relates to \nthe IRPA's objective of protecting Canadians and denying access to Canadian territory to serious \ncriminals. \n \nNote: Exclusions under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention concern the commission of a crime. It is \nnot necessary for the claimant to have been convicted of a serious non-political crime. All that is \nnecessary is that there be serious reasons for believing that the person has committed such a \ncrime. \n \nSee Appendix B for case law on exclusions under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. \n \n1. Concept of serious non-political crime \n \nIn order to successfully intervene in cases of exclusion under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention, \nhearings officers must clearly articulate the definition of a serious non-political crime. \n \nAccording to paragraph 155 of the UNHCR Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for \nDetermining Refugee Status, \n \n“What constitutes a ‘serious’ non-political crime for the purposes of this exclusion clause is \ndifficult to define, especially since the term ‘crime’ has different connotations in different legal \nsystems. In some countries, the word ‘crime’ denotes only offences of a serious character. In \nother countries, it may comprise anything from petty larceny to murder. In the present context, \nhowever, a ‘serious’ crime must be a capital crime or a very grave punishable act. Minor offences \npunishable by moderate sentences are not grounds for exclusion under article 1F(b) of the \nRefugee Convention, even if technically referred to as ‘crimes’ in the penal law of the country \nconcerned.”\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n22 \n \n \nIn the context of the IRPA, the term “serious crime” is understood to mean an indictable offence under the \nCriminal Code of Canada (including mixed offences). “Serious crimes” are defined as serious by \ncomparing the acts or omissions alleged against the claimant to Canada’s criminal law. Offences that \nlead to at least 10 or more years of imprisonment are considered “serious crimes,” but lesser penalties \nmay qualify, depending on the circumstances and nature of the crime committed (see Jayasekara v. \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FCA 404, which establishes that, where a \nmaximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in \nCanada, the crime will generally be considered serious). \n \nThe presumption of the seriousness of a crime may be rebutted by the following factors: \n \n \nthe elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts, and the \nmitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction; \n \nany mitigating factors; and \n \nthe gravity of the crime, had it been committed in Canada. \n \nFor detailed analysis on the above factors, refer to Jayasekara v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2008 FCA 404, [2009] 4 F.C.R. 164. \n \nThe Federal Court of Appeal decisions in Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FCA 324 \nand in Feimi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FCA 325 determined that \nrehabilitation and current danger are not relevant considerations in applying exclusions for serious \ncriminality under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. The following certified question was answered \nnegatively by the court in Febles: \n \nWhen applying article 1F(b) of theRefugee Convention, is it relevant for the RPD of the IRB to \nconsider the fact that the refugee claimant has been rehabilitated since the commission of the \ncrime at issue? \n \nThe court found the argument that a crime may be considered as less serious years after its commission \nbecause the claimant is rehabilitated and is no longer a danger is inconsistent with the court’s reasoning \nin Jayasekara. Justice Létourneau determined that, although the presumption of seriousness may be \nrebutted (by the factors above), there is no balancing of factors extraneous to the facts and \ncircumstances underlying the conviction, such as the risk of persecution in the state of origin. In Febles, \nthe Federal Court of Appeal found that rehabilitation is an extraneous factor and is not to be balanced \nagainst the presumed seriousness of the crime. \n \nNote: This decision was upheld by the SCC. In Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 \nSCC 68, at paragraph 62, the SCC also commented that “while consideratioin of whether a maximum \nsentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada is a \nuseful guideline, and while crimes attracting a maximum sentence of ten years or more in Canada will \ngenerally be sufficiently serious to warrant exclusion, the ten-year rule should not be applied in a \nmechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner” \n \nThe decision to invoke the exclusion clause or not depends on the seriousness of the offence committed. \nApplication of the exclusion clause is warranted in the case of offences that directly or indirectly affect a \nperson’s physical integrity and also offences such as fabrication of false passports, impersonation, and \nwhite-collar crimes. The CBSA policy is to exclude all individuals who are serious criminals in order to\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n23 \n \n \npromote security and international justice. Where a hearings officer determines that sufficient evidence \nexists to raise the question of exclusion, and this evidence may allow the RPD to make a finding of \nexclusion, the hearings officer must intervene in the case. \n \nNote: Officers may refer to ENF 2, Evaluating Inadmissibility for additional information. \n \n2. Concept of political crime \n \nFor a crime to be considered political, it must have been committed during political troubles in a struggle \nto overthrow the government. Also, there must be a relationship between the crime committed and \nattainment of the desired goal. The political aspect of the offence must be more important than the non- \npolitical crime aspect. However, an exception to this interpretation is made where the nature of the crime \nis completely disproportionate to the goal that is sought or where the act is barbarous or atrocious. \n \nThere are offences that are clearly political in nature. These may include treason, espionage, \nmembership in a prohibited political party, or election fraud. However, there are also common offences \nthat have been committed with a clear political motivation. If the political character of the offence \noutweighs the character of a common crime, the offence should be treated as a political offence. \n \nElements of a political crime \n \nThe two parts to the test for determining whether an offence is of a political nature are the \n \n1. political objective; and \n2. nexus between the objective and the alleged crime. \n \n \nThe crime must be committed in the course of and incidental to a violent political disturbance. \nTherefore, a certain level of violence must exist. \n \nThe nature and purpose of the offence requires examination. An officer should consider if \npersonal reasons or gain were the objective or if there were genuine political motives. \n \nThe political element should outweigh the common, law character of the offence. \n \nAn officer should consider whether the crime was aimed against a civilian, military, or \ngovernment target and whether or not indiscriminate killing or injuring of the public occurred. \n \n3. Concept of complicity in a non-political crime \n \nA person may be excluded from the definition of Convention refugee if it is established that the person \nwas complicit in a serious non-political crime. \n \nNote: The SCC decision in Ezokola applies equally to articles 1F(a) and 1F(b) of the Refugee \nConvention. \n \nFor additional information on complicity in the context of exclusions, refer to ENF 18 War Crimes and \nCrimes Against Humanity and section 7.2 and Appendix B of this manual chapter. \n \n4. Extradition \n \nIf a person who applies for refugee protection is the subject of an originating order made under section 15\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n24 \n \n \nof the Extradition Act for a foreign offence punishable under an Act of Parliament by a maximum term of \nimprisonment of at least ten years, the RPD shall not commence or shall suspend consideration of the \nmatter until such time as a final ruling on the extradition application is made [A105(1)]. \n \nIf a person is ordered surendered under the scheme of the Extradition Act for an offence contemplated in \nsubsection A105(1), that person’s refugee protection application is treated like a refusal of a refugee \nprotection application, based on article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention [A105(3)]. \n \nIf, however, a person is discharged under the Extradition Act, the matter will be continued at the RPD \n[A105(2)]. \n \n5. Special case of the abduction or removal of a child from custody in contravention of a  custody \norder \n \nIn cases where children accompanied by a single parent make a refugee protection claim—the other \nparent having remained in the country of nationality or being located elsewhere—it is important to \nestablish whether the child was abducted or removed from custody in contravention of a custody order. \nSee the provisions concerning the abduction of children in sections 280 to 286 of the Criminal Code. \n \nTo determine whether a child has been abducted or removed from the custody of a parent, and whether it \nis necessary to invoke exclusion under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention, officers must consider \nthe following factors: \n \n \nthe marital status of the parents; \n \nthe age of majority in the country of nationality; \n \nthe need to obtain the consent of both parents or of the legal guardian for the child to travel \noutside of the country of nationality; \n \nconsent by the parent or guardian; \n \na custody order in favour of the other parent; \n \na credible defence (see section 285 of the Criminal Code), namely that the acts were necessary \nto protect the child from imminent danger or to allow the parent to flee imminent danger; and \n \ncommunication between the child and the other parent since the child’s arrival in Canada. \n \nOfficers must contact and work in collaboration with provincial child protection agencies in cases of \nabduction or cases where the parent outside of Canada wishes to appear as a witness in the case. \n \nFor additional information on children making refugee protection claims, refer to Processing in-Canada \nclaims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable persons. \n \n5.14 Exclusion under article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention \n \nArticle 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention concerns acts that are contrary to the purposes and principles of \nthe United Nations. Given that articles 1F(a) and 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention also apply in many \ncases, this provision is applied rarely. \n \nAlthough debate regarding the use of article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention persists, the following \nconclusions on its application can be drawn:\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n25 \n \n \nApplication of article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention \n \n1. This exclusion ground should be interpreted restrictively. \n2. The acts committed must be criminal in nature. \n3. Article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention includes acts committed in the country of refuge and the \ncountry of origin. \n4. Applies to acts committed by individuals in the exercise of government functions and individuals \nwith no connection to government. \n \nDevelopments in international law and a conservative approach by the SCC have led article 1F(c) of the \nRefugee Convention to have a limited application. Leading cases in this area include: \n \n \nBazargan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), (1996), 205 N.R. 282. \n \nPushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (1998) 1 S.C.R. 982. \n \nBitaraf v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (2004) FC 898. \n \nEl Hayek v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (2005) FC 835. \n \nIslam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immgration), (2010) FC 71. \n \nZrig v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immgration), (2003) FCA 178. \n \nHarb v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (2003) FCA 39. \n \nNote: The purposes and principles of the United Nations are stated in the preamble of the Refugee \nConvention and in articles 1 and 2 of the UN Charter. \n \nArticle 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention applies to acts that constitute very serious and repetitive \nviolations of human rights. Acts that may be considered to be contrary to the purposes and \nprinciples of the United Nations include international kidnapping, torture, hostage-taking, \nenforced disappearances, and apartheid. These crimes may be committed in Canada after the \nperson’s arrival or in another country before the person’s arrival. \n \nIn Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, the SCC \nestablished the following: \n \n \ndrug trafficking is not included in exclusions under article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention; \n \nexclusions under article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention apply to senior government officials and \nto individuals who have no connection to government; \n \nexclusions under article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention apply to individuals who have been \nconvicted and to persons who have committed a crime but have not been convicted. \n \nThe SCC also established that application of article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention in exclusions does \nnot require a weighing of exclusion and inclusion factors (i.e., evaluating the nature of the crime against \nthe degree of persecution to which the perpetrator might be exposed). \n \nNote: The information on complicity and the means of defence referred to below in the context of \nexclusions under article 1F of the Refugee Convention also applies to exclusions under article 1F(c) of \nthe Refugee Convention (see Appendix B for more information). \n \nIn Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), the SCC set out two categories of \nacts that fall within exclusions under article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n26 \n \n \nFirst category \n \nThe existence of a widely accepted international agreement or a United Nations Resolution, which \ndeclares that the commission of certain acts is contrary to the purposes and principles of the United \nNations. \n \nSimilarly, other sources of international law may be relevant in a court's determination of whether an act \nfalls within article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention. For example, determinations by the International \nCourt of Justice may be compelling. \n \nSecond category \n \nIncludes acts that a court characterizes as serious, sustained, and systemic violations of fundamental \nhuman rights constituting persecution. \n \nThis second category was also described by the SCC as including any act whereby an international \ninstrument has indicated that it is a violation of fundamental human rights. \n \nThe types of activities which are against the principles and purposes of the United Nations are outlined in \ninternational jurisprudence. \n \nNote: For case law on exclusions under article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention, see Appendix B. \n \nMost cases involving article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention have pertained to either terrorist activities or \nhuman rights violations. A recent case by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom also added that \nattacks against peacekeeping operations mandated by the United Nations amount to acts against the \npurposes and principles of the United Nations in the case of Al-Sirri and DD v. Secretary of State for the \nHome Department [2012] UKSC 54.1 \n \n5.15 Means of defence applicable to article 1F of the Refugee \nConvention \n \nThe burden of proof with respect to defences lies with the person concerned, meaning the defence has to \nbe raised and proven by that person. \n \nOf all the possible defences in both criminal and immigration/refugee law, such as mistake of law, self \ndefence or intoxication, superior orders and duress have been raised most often. \n \na) Duress \n \nIn order for the defence of duress to be successful, the claimant must show to have been in danger of \nimminent harm and the harm feared must be on a balance greater than the harm inflicted. The claimant \nmust have acted necessarily and reasonably to avoid this threat and must not be responsible for their \nown predicament. The remorse that the claimant now feels is not relevant. \n \n \n1 http://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2009_0036_Judgment.pdf\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n27 \n \n \nb) Defence of superior orders \n \nThe defence of superior orders rests on the notion that the position held required the individual to follow \norders from the government or a superior officer. Although this defence may be used in a criminal \nprosecution to argue for a lighter sentence, it is not relevant for the purposes of the IRPA and cannot \novercome inadmissibility pursuant to paragraph A35(1)(a) or article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention, \nexcept in the narrow case of war crimes (in which case it needs to be shown by the person concerned \nthat committing a war crime was not manifestly unlawful, which is a difficult test to meet). \n \nc) Prosecution versus persecution \n \nA common defence raised in cases of exclusion under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention is that the \nclaimant alleges that the criminal charges they are facing in the country of nationality are a form of \npersecution. That is, the claimant alleges that the charges were fabricated by the authorities in the \ncountry of alleged persecution. \n \nWhen assessing persecution as a means of defence, the hearings officer should be aware of the \nconsiderations below. \n \n1. The Federal Court of Appeal and the SCC have stated that, in the absence of evidence to the \ncontrary, Canadian tribunals must assume that a fair and independent judicial process has taken \nplace in the foreign country. \n2. In the context of extradition matters, the SCC held that the courts may intervene if the decision to \nsurrender a fugitive for trial in a foreign country would, in the particular circumstances, violate the \nprinciples of fundamental justice pursuant to section 7 of the Charter. An example of an \nexceptional circumstance would be extradition to potential death penalty. However, to surrender a \nperson to be tried for a crime the person is alleged to have committed in the foreign country in the \nabsence of exceptional circumstances does not violate the principles of fundamental justice. In \nthe absence of exceptional circumstances, Canadian courts must assume that the person will be \ngiven a fair trial in the foreign country. \n \n \nRepublic of Argentina v. Mellino, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 536 at 558. \n \n3. In the context of the refugee determination process and in the absence of proof by the refugee \nclaimant, Canadian tribunals must assume a fair trial has taken place. The notion of a fair trial in a \nfair and independent judicial system must make allowance for the self-correcting mechanisms \nwithin the system (e.g., the trial judge’s control over the excesses of the participants and the \ncontrol of the appellate courts over any errors of the trial judge). \n \nIn all but the most extraordinary circumstances, the events leading up to a prosecution and trial in \na free and independent foreign judicial system must be taken to be merged into the judicial \nprocess and not open to review by a Canadian tribunal. Extraordinary circumstances would be \nthose that tend to impeach the total system of prosecution, jury selection, or judging, not \nindiscretions or illegalities by individual participants, which, even if proven, are subject to \ncorrection by the process itself. \n \nThe application of the principle of fundamental justice in the context of the refugee determination \nprocess was sanctioned by the SCC in Ward.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n28 \n \n \n \nCanada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Satiacum, [1989] F.C.J. No. 505 \n(F.C.A.), cited with approval in Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, [1993] 2. S.C.R. 689 at \npage 725. \n \nFor additional details on means of defence, see section 7.4 of ENF 18, War Crimes and Crimes Against \nHumanity. \n \n5.16 Intervention strategy for exclusion cases \n \nAs per subrule 29(2) of the RPDR, hearings officers have the option to intervene in writing, in person, or \nboth. \n \nThe preferred approach is for the hearings officers to intervene in person, particularly for the more \ncontentious cases. The concern about paper-based interventions is the quality and scope of evidence \ntesting that may take place in the absence of a hearings officer. While RPD members can and should \nquestion the claimant about the exclusion material filed by the Minister, the member’s primary role is that \nof an impartial decision maker. \n \nHearings officers are much better placed to conduct probing examinations that test all of the evidence put \nbefore the decision maker. Hearings officers appear in an adversarial role at an RPD hearing and \nscrutinise and challenge the evidence in a way that RPD members may be reluctant to do, given their role \nas indepenendent decision makers. \n \nDepending on circumstances, paper-based intervention by filing evidence and submissions may be \nappropriate. Case law is clear that the Minister does not need to participate at the hearing in order for the \nRPD to make an exclusion finding [Arica v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1995), \n182 NR 392 (FCA)]. To this end, hearings officers must assess whether or not their presence at the \nhearing will be beneficial to the determination process. \n \nIf it is determined that intervention by way of filing of documents is the appropriate action, it is absolutely \nnecessary that the hearings officer who is assigned to the case follows the decision very closely. If the \noutcome is not satisfactory and if it is possible to appeal the decision, a determination will have to be \nmade as to whether it is appropriate for the Minister to file an appeal to the RAD or an application for \nleave and judicial review. \n \nThe hearings officer’s task is to \n \n \nensure that the RPD member, in dealing with matters that lie outside of the member’s specialized \npurview, is informed about the terms specific to the Department (e.g., GCMS, FOSS, CAIPS, \ndocuments of the United States [U.S.] Immigration and Naturalization Service), and the contents \nof the documents produced by the hearings officer; and \n \nquestion the claimant about the grounds for exclusion and, where necessary, about credibility \nand/or program integrity. \n \nNote: If the member thinks that there is sufficient evidence to support application of the exclusion clause, \nthe member may make a determination without hearing the inclusion evidence.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n29 \n \n \n5.17 First priority: Cases where a member of the RPD requests \nintervention from the Minister of PSEP \n \nSince the RPD may or, in some cases, must inform the Minister of PSEP of matters pertaining to \nexclusion and certain inadmissibilities (rules 26 and 28 of the RPDR), it is important that officers take the \npanel’s requests for intervention into account and be available to help ensure the proper conduct of the \nhearing in accordance with the member’s instructions. \n \nThe RPD “Red letters” will be faxed to the triage centre closest to the claimant’s address, and the triage \ncentre will fax them to the appropriate hearings office, where it will be determined whether an intervention \nis warranted. \n \nNote: The Minister has 14 days after receipt of the notice to respond to exclusion issues and 20 days \nafter receipt to respond to a notice of possible inadmissibility or ineligibility before the RPD must fix a date \nfor the hearing or resume a hearing that was suspended. \n \n5.18 Second priority: Cases where the outcome will have a very great \nimpact on the integrity of the program \n \nAs discussed in section 5.3 of this manual chapter, pursuant to the R&I pilot, IRCC senior immigration \nofficers can intervene on program integrity grounds, unless the case is a hybrid case, the claimant is or \nwas detained or is an irregular arrival (DFN), or Charter arguments are involved. \n \nSecond priority cases are cases that \n \n \nestablish a new trend in the movement of persons; \n \naffect a large population of refugee protection claimants; and \n \ninvolve misrepresentation, fraud, or human trafficking. \n \nSince the arrival of very large numbers of refugee protection claimants with particular ties (nationality, \nethnicity, religion, etc.) may lead to the establishment of precedents at the IRB, it is important to identify \nclearly and to monitor these types of cases. \n \nNote: Cases giving rise to monitoring in this context are cases where certain indications suggest that \nspecific groups of persons are not genuine refugees. Refer to section 5.5, Criteria for evaluating cases. \n \nMembership in a group of individuals does not in itself justify intervention. What is important is to identify \ngroups of individuals who are using the refugee protection determination process in a fraudulent way in \norder to ensure that the RPD is aware of the fraud and argue that the claim should be rejected as \nmanifestly unfounded. Individuals whose claims are rejected and determined by the RPD to have no \ncredible basis or to be manifestly unfounded do not have acess to the RAD. [A110(2)(c)] \n \nNote: The individuals in question may come from the same region or have employed the same network of \nsmugglers and allege persecution, while the CBSA or IRCC may have information suggesting that these \nclaims are based on false declarations (i.e., they are not actually members of a political or religious \ngroup).\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n30 \n \n \nThe objective in monitoring these types of cases is to ensure that those who are fleeing persecution \nbenefit from due process in a timely fashion and to offer refugee protection to those who have a well- \nfounded fear of persecution by reason of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social \ngroup, or political opinion and to those who are at risk of torture or cruel and unusual punishment. \n \n5.19 Strategy to adopt in second-priority cases \n \nSince these cases may have a major impact on the integrity of the program, it is imperative to intervene \nwhen the initial refugee protection claims are made. \n \nIn case of a mass arrival, it is important to develop expertise regarding the country concerned and the \nalleged events. Regions must consult the documentation centre of the IRB to obtain the available \ninformation on relevant topics, and the hearings officer must determine whether additional research is \nnecessary to add to the evidence to support the CBSA’s position. \n \nNote: The preferred approach is intervention in person, for the initial cases at least. However, depending \non circumstances, intervention by filing evidence and submissions may be appropriate in specific cases. \nHearings officers must assess whether or not their attendance at the hearing will be beneficial to the \ndetermination process. \n \nIf it is determined that intervention by filing of documents is the appropriate action, it is absolutely \nnecessary that hearings officers follow the decisions very closely. If the outcome is not satisfactory, the \nteam leaders will have to determine whether intervention in the hearing room is required for future cases. \n \nNote: If an undesirable precedent is created, it is often difficult to reverse it. \n \nIf the presence of a hearings officer at the hearing is determined to be essential, the results are \nsatisfactory, and a trend has developed, the team lead must determine whether attendance to \nsubsequent cases continues to be necessary to attain the desired objectives. \n \nIt is up to the regions to monitor the decisions and to inform National Headquarters and other partners of \nthe results obtained. \n \n5.20 Cases involving a single individual (and family) \n \nDue to the particular profile of a case, there are compelling considerations in favour of intervention by the \nCBSA. \n \nNote: In this type of case, the final outcome of a decision has a very serious impact on the entire program \nand may affect subsequent refugee claims. \n \nThese cases may involve interpretation of a legislative provision, case law, or doctrine. They may also be \nsensitive cases likely to attract special attention from the media. \n \n5.21 Strategy to adopt in cases involving a single individual \n \nIntervention in person should be the preferred strategy, apart from exceptional cases.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n31 \n \n \n5.22 Third priority: Credibility cases whose impact on the program is \nminimal \n \nThird-priority cases are credibility cases that involve program integrity considerations but have less of an \nimpact on the program as a whole. As discussed in section 5.3 of this manual chapter, IRCC senior \nimmigration officers intervene in RPD hearings on grounds of credibility and program integrity, unless the \ncase is hybrid, the claimant is or was detained, the claimant is an irregular arrival, or Charter arguments \nare made. \n \nFor more information, see section 5.22 (exclusion cases under article 1E of the Refugee Convention) and \nsection 5.24 below (other cases involving credibility, identity, or nexus issues). \n \n5.23 Exclusion cases under article 1E of the Refugee Convention \n \nSection A98 excludes persons referred to in article 1E of the Refugee Convention as follows: \n \n“This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of \nthe country in which he is taking residence as having the rights and obligations which are \nattached to the possession of the nationality of that country.” \n \nSince the person seeking refugee protection already enjoys the protection of another country, Canada \nhas no responsibility to protect the person. This provision prevents people who already enjoy a \npermanent right of asylum from “asylum shopping” in other countries. \n \nThere is no precise definition of the rights and obligations mentioned in this section. However, it can be \nsaid that the exclusion clause will apply if the status of the person applying for refugee protection is \nsubstantially similar to that of a person having the nationality of the country in question. \n \nIn particular, the person must enjoy protection against refoulement or expulsion for crimes that are not \nserious and must have a right to return to the country of residence. \n \nOther rights, such as the right to work, be educated, return, have access to social services, or be free to \ncirculate within the country may also be associated with the possession of nationality. \n \nIn some countries, people who have status similar to that of a permanent resident in Canada may satisfy \nthe criteria of article 1E of the Refugee Convention. Some countries issue temporary visas with an \nautomatic extension option and no discretion of the government or of a public servant if an application is \nmade for them. These applications are often for spouses of nationals, for children of nationals, or for \npersons who have been within the national territory for a very long time and whose status is not \nprecarious. This type of status may also bring the exclusion clause into play, depending on \ncircumstances. \n \nNote: Students or temporary workers are not usually included in this class, unless they can establish a \nstatus that is stable or automatically renewable without any discretion of the government or of a public \nservant. \n \nCountry shopping\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n32 \n \n \nThe Federal Court has held that article 1E of the Refugee Convention can be applied to persons who \ncome to Canada when asylum shopping or to persons who take deliberate actions that are intended to \nresult in not being able to return to the country where they already have refugee status. For example, not \nrenewing a visa that could easily have been renewed [Shahpari v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmgration), F.C.T.D., IMM-2327-97, April 3, 1998]. For each case, the hearings officer should consider if \nthe individual intentionally allowed their status to expire in the country in question. \n \nOnus and the right of return \n \nIn Shamlou v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1995), (F.C.T.D.) and Shahpari v. \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immgration), the court speaks to the issue of right of return. The \ncourt has gone as far as to say that there is an onus on the claimant to renew their status, if it is \nrenewable, in the country under article 1E of the Refugee Convention. In Shahpari, the court held that \nonce the Minister submits evidence to the effect that an applicant can return to a given country, the onus \nthen shifts to the applicant to show that they cannot. \n \nIn Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Zeng, 2010 FCA 118, Justice Layden-Stevenson \nconcluded that it is permissible for the RPD to consider an individual’s status in a third country upon \narrival in Canada and thereafter, up until and including the date of the hearing before the RPD in order to \ndetermine whether the individual should be excluded under article 1E of the Refugee Convention. She \nalso concluded that it is permissible for the RPD, in assessing whether article 1E of the Refugee \nConvention applies, to consider what steps the individual took or did not take to cause or fail to prevent \nthe loss of status in a third country. \n \nThe test is to be applied in determinations under article 1E of the Refugee Convention is as follows: \n \na) Considering all of the relevant factors up to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status \nsubstantially similar to that of the nationals in a third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is \nexcluded. \nb) If the answer to a) is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and \nlost it or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not \nexcluded. \nc) If the answer to b) is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors, including but not \nlimited to the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), the ability of the claimant to \nreturn to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the third country, Canada’s \ninternational obligations, and all other relevant facts. \n \nIt will be for the RPD to weigh the factors and arrive at a determination as to whether the exclusion will \napply, given the particular circumstances of the case at hand. \n \n \nShahpari v.

However, in some exceptional cases, it is appropriate to intervene in person. \n \nAs discussed in section 5.3 of this manual chapter, IRCC senior immigration officers handle the majority \nof cases under article 1E of the Refugee Convention. A CBSA hearings officer should only intervene in \ncases where hybrid grounds were identified at triage, e.g., where the claimant is or was detained, or is an \nirregular arrival (DFN), or where Charter arguments are being made. \n \n5.25 Other cases involving credibility, identity, or nexus issues \n \nThe final outcome of these cases will have only a limited impact in the sense that it will only affect the \nrefugee claimant and the family, not the integrity of the program itself. In other words, the import of the \ndecisions in these cases is limited. \n \nThese cases may involve some of the following situations: \n \n \nmultiple or fraudulent identities; \n \nfraudulent declarations in the claim for refugee protection; \n \na refugee protection claim for reasons that cannot be associated with the definition of a \nConvention refugee or of a person in need of protection; \n \na prolonged stay in a country that is a signatory to the Refugee Convention without a claim being \nmade for refugee protection; \n \nan application for a Canadian visa from outside of Canada for reasons that contradict the reasons \ncontained in the form submitted to the IRB; \n \nprevious contradictory declarations; \n \nrejected refugee claims of family members; \n \na denunciation; \n \nseizure of documents in the mail. \n \nFor more information on credibility, refer to the IRB reference paper, Assessment of Credibility in Claims \nfor Refugee Protection, and for nexus issues, refer to Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition \nin the Case Law. \n \n5.26 Strategy to adopt in cases involving credibility, identity, and nexus \nissues \n \nIn these cases, most interventions are done by filing documents and making written submissions because \nthese cases do not involve general program integrity issues. In some cases, an intervention in person \nmay be appropriate.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n34 \n \n \n5.27 Disclosure of personal information from the refugee claim of a \nthird party \n \nIn support of an intervention in a refugee claim or an application to vacate or to cease refugee protection, \nthe Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as the case may be, may wish to introduce to the IRB as \nevidence personal information from the refugee claim of a third party. \n \nGenerally, personal information (as defined in section 3 of the Privacy Act) of a third party cannot be \ndisclosed without that party’s consent (section 8 of the Privacy Act). However, rule 21 of the RPDR gives \nthe RPD the authority to disclose information from another claim, including personal information protected \nby the Privacy Act. \n \nIf the Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as a party to the claim concerned (rule 1 of the RPDR), \nwishes information from the claim of a third party to be disclosed pursuant to rule 21 of the RPDR, they \nmust make an application to the RPD to allow that disclosure, as per rule 49 of the RPDR and subject to \nrule 50 of the RPDR. \n \nIn determining whether to allow the disclosure of information from another claim, the RPD must, as per \nrule 21 of the RPDR, consider if, as per \n \n1. subrule 21(1) of the RPDR, the information to be disclosed involves “similar questions of fact or if \nthe information is otherwise relevant”; and \n2. subrule 21(5) of the RPDR, whether or not a serious possibility exists that the disclosure of the \ninformation concerned would “endanger the life, liberty or security of any person or is likely to \ncause an injustice.” \n \nIn light of these requirements, the Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as the case may be, should \nconsider, prior to making an application for disclosure, whether or not the conditions set out in rule 21 of \nthe RPDR are likely to be met. If the Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC believes that the \ninformation concerned does meet the relevancy criteria and that there is no serious possibility that the \ndisclosure of said information would endanger the life, liberty or security of any person, the Minister of \nPSEP or the Minister of IRCC should proceed with an application to have the information disclosed. \n \n5.28 Notice of Constitutional Question \n \nConstitutional challenges are governed by rule 66 of the RPDR, which complies with the requirements of \nsection 57 of the Federal Courts Act. A party wanting to challenge the constitutional validity, applicability \nor operability of a statutory provision must prepare a Notice of Constitutional Question (Notice) and then \nprovide the original to the RPD and copies to the other party, the Attorney General of Canada and the \nAttorney General of every province and territory in Canada. \n \nThe Notice must be received by the recipients no later than 10 days before the date on which the \nconstitutional question is to be argued. It must contain the information listed in subrule 66(2) of the RPDR; \nthis information is similar to the information contained in Form 69 of the Federal Courts Rules (1998), \nentitled “Notice of Constitutional Question.” \n \n6 Cessation\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n35 \n \n \nThe Minister's participation in the refugee determination process is not limited to intervening in the \nhearing of a refugee claim. When information comes to the attention of the Minister that a protected \nperson (see subsection A95(2) for precise definition) may no longer require protection for one of the \ngrounds set out in subsection A108(1), the Minister may bring an application to the RPD for a \ndetermination that refugee protection has ceased. \n \nLike interventions, cessation is a means for the Minister to maintain the integrity of the refugee \ndetermination process. \n \nIRCC is responsible for the development and oversight of policies with respect to the cessation of refugee \nprotection. \n \nThe CBSA is responsible for administering the operational delivery of cessation policies; specifically, \nCBSA hearings officers are responsible for filing applications for cessation and representing the Minister \nof IRCC before the RPD. \n \n6.1 Against whom an application for cessation is made \n \nThe Minister may make an application to cease refugee protection, regardless of the process under which \nrefugee protection was conferred [A95(2)] in the following circumstances: \n \na) overseas selection process (or resettlement from overseas) [A95(1)(a] in which officers should \ncontact Inland Enforcement Operations if they are uncertain as to whether or not a person was \nconferred refugee protection overseas; \nb) determination of a refugee claim by the RPD or the RAD [A95(1)(b)]; and \nc) when the Minister allows, with the exception of persons described in subsection A112(3), an \napplication for protection (PRRA) [A95(1)(c)]. \n \nWhen an individual has obtained Canadian citizenship, an application for cessation against them shall not \nbe pursued so long as they maintain their Canadian citizenship. \n \nUnless there is an exceptional circumstance (e.g., an individual is referred to the Immigration Division for \none of the grounds enumerated under sections A34 to A37), when a protected person is a permanent \nresident an application for cessation against them should not be pursued solely under the cessation \nground A108(1)(e) (as any such application would not have an appreciable effect). \n \nWhen a protected person is a foreign national, an application for cessation against them may be pursued \nsolely under the cessation ground outlined in paragraph A108(1)(e). \n \nNote: When an investigation for possible cessation is ongoing, the information should be uploaded in the \nsystems (FOSS, NCMS, GCMS) by writing the following: “Ongoing Cessation Investigation.” \n \n6.2 Nature of an application for cessation \n \nCessation proceedings are adversarial, and the burden of proof rests with the Minister to show why the \nperson has ceased to be a protected person. The standard of proof required for the Minister to discharge \ntheir burden is a balance of probabilities.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n36 \n \n \n6.3 Role of the hearings officer \n \nHearings officers are the Minister’s representative in cessation proceedings. After reviewing the \nsupporting evidence of a case, the hearings officer will assess whether prima facie evidence exists to \nsupport one of the grounds for cessation set out in subsection A108(1). \n \nNote: The UNHCR Handbook stipulates at paragraph 116 that “cessation clauses are negative in \ncharacter and are exhaustively enumerated. They should, therefore, be interpreted restrictively, and no \nother reasons may be adduced by way of analogy to justify the withdrawal of refugee status” [Silvia \nOlvera Romero v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 2014 FC 671, par. 39; UNHCR, Note on the \nCessation Clauses, EC/47/SC/CRP.30, Standing Committee, 30 May 1977, para. 8]. \n \nAt paragraph 106 in Olvera Romero v. Minister (C&I) 2014 FC 671, Justice Strickland stated that the \nhearings officer’s discretion (whether or not to make an application to cease refugee protection) was \nlimited to a consideration of whether the factors listed in ENF 24 (Note: this updated version of ENF 24 \nhas removed the list of these factors) and the information gathered led to a reasonable, fact-based belief \nthat any of the cessation criteria outlined in paragraphs A108(1)(a) to A108(1)(d) had been met. Justice \nStickland held that, if this was so, the hearings officer was obliged to make the cessation application. \n \nJustice Strickland clearly stated that the hearings officer has no discretion to consider factors beyond \nthose related to paragraphs A108(1)(a) to A108(1)(d), including humanitarian and compassionate factors, \nwhich are specifically addressed by section A25. \n \nNote that the facts specific to Olvera Romero did not include consideration of paragraph A108(1)(e), \nwhich may explain why Justice Strickland did not include that paragraph in her explanation of the scope \nof a hearings officer’s discretion. In Bermudez v. Minister (C&I) 2015 FC 639, Justice Mosley certified the \nfollowing question: \n \n“Does the CBSA hearings officer, or the hearings officer as the Minister’s delegate, have the discretion to \nconsider factors other than those set out in subsection A108(1), including H&C considerations and the \nbest interests of a child, when deciding whether to make a cessation application pursuant to \nsubsection A108(2) in respect of a permanent resident?” \n \nUntil the Federal Court of Appeal rules on this matter, it is the Minister’s position that hearings officers do \nnot have discretion to consider factors beyond those related to grounds set out in subsection A108(1). \n \nIn certain circumstances, the hearings officer may deem it necessary to gather additional information prior \nto submitting an application for cessation. This may include inviting the person concerned for an \ninterview. The additional information sought must relate to facts that are relevant to the grounds for \ncessation set out in subsection A108(1). Justice Strickland in Olvera Romero at paragrahp 78 stated that \nit would be prudent for CBSA officers to advise individuals that the purpose of their questions is to inform \na potential cessation application, which would permit the person concerned to contemporaneously \nprovide a verbal response with any relevant information, which could, potentially, have the effect of \ncausing the hearings officer to determine that there was no factual basis for believing that any of the \nsubsection A108(1) criteria has been met and exercising their discretion not to proceed with the cessation \napplication. \n \nAt paragraph 79 in Olvera Romero, Justice Strickland held that while a duty of fairness is owed by the\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n37 \n \n \nhearings officer, the content of that duty did not require that notice and an opportunity to make \nsubmissions be given prior to the decision to make the cessation application. However, in Bermudez v. \nMinister (C&I) 2015 FC 639, at paragraph 35, Justice Mosley contradicted Justice Strickland’s position by \nstating that, in his view, the duty of fairness required that the person concerned be given an opportunity to \npresent full submissions as to why the application to the RPD should not be made. This conflict at the \nFederal Court level has not been addressed by the Federal Court of Appeal at the time of this update to \nENF 24. Until this conflict is resolved by the Federal Court of Appeal, the Minister prefers the position \narticulated in Olvera Romero. \n \nWriting in the context of paragraph A108(1)(a), Justice Heneghan, in Balouch v. Minister (PSEP) 2015 FC \n765, at paragraph 19, held that she was not persuaded that the issue of risk is relevant in a cessation \nhearing. Justice Heneghan certified the following question: \n \n“When deciding whether to allow an application by the Minister for cessation of refugee status pursuant to \nparagraph A108(1)(a), based on past actions, can the Board allow the Minister’s application without \naddressing whether the person is at risk of persecution upon return to their country of nationality at the \ntime of the cessation hearing?” \n \nUntil the Federal Court of Appeal rules on this matter, it is the Minister’s position that no forward-looking \nrisk assessment is conducted at a cessation hearing for paragraphs A108(1)(a) to A108(1)(d), nor is it a \nfactor when a hearings officer determines whether to make an application to cease refugee protection \nunder paragraphs A108(1)(a) to A108(1)(d). According to the Refugee Convention, the UNHCR \nHandbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 \nConvention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (UNHCR Handbook), and the \nIRPA, cessation does not require a forward-looking assessment of risk, since an alternative means of \nprotection has been demonstrated by the individual’s actions [A108(1)(a) to A108(1)(d)] or the reasons for \nwhich the person sought refugee protection no longer exist [A108(1)(e)]. \n \n6.4 Procedural Requirements: RPDR \n \nWhen the evidence establishes a prima facie case for one of the grounds enumerated in \nsubsection A108(1), the Minister should submit an application for cessation to the RPD in accordance \nwith rule 64 of the RPDR. This rule sets out the content of the application, including the decision the \nMinister wants the RPD to make and the reasons why the RPD should make that decision. \n \nThe Minister must provide the protected person with a copy of the application and the RPD Registry with \na written statement indicating how and when it was provided to the protected person (subrule 64(3) of the \nRPDR). If the Minister is unable to provide a copy of the application to the protected person as per rule 39 \nof the RPDR, the Minister can bring to the RPD an application under rule 40 of the RPDR for permission \nto provide the document in another way or to be excused from providing the document. The RPD must \nnot allow the application unless the Minister has made reasonable efforts to provide the protected person \nwith the application (subrule 40(3) of the RPDR). \n \n6.5 Paragraph A108(1)(a): The person has voluntarily reavailed \nthemselves of the protection of their country of nationality \n \nThe Federal Court has relied on the UNHCR Handbook to provide interpretive guidance as to the\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n38 \n \n \nmeaning of reavailment [Li v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 2015 FC 459; Siddiqui v. \nCitizenship and Immigration, 2015 FC 329; Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. \nBashir, 2015 FC 51; Makeen v. Citizenship and Immigration, IMM-1862-14 (unreported); Nsende v. \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2008 FC 531; Cabrera Cadena v. Canada (Public \nSafety and Emergency Preparedness) 2012 FC 67]. \n \nNote: The terms “nationality” and “citizenship” are synonymous for the purposes of the cessation \nprovisions in subsection A108(1). \n \nHearings officers should consider the three requirements below, as outlined in paragraph 119 of the \nUNHCR Handbook, when deciding whether to apply to cease refugee protection under \nparagraph A108(1)(a). \n \n1. Voluntariness: The person must act voluntarily. \n \nIf the protected person does not act voluntarily, they will not cease to be a protected person. For example, \nif a protected person is instructed by an authority to perform against their will an act that could be \ninterpreted as reavailment, they will not cease to be a protected person for obeying such instruction \n[UNHCR Handbook, paragraph 120]. Voluntariness should be measured by whether or not the protected \nperson was compelled to act by circumstances beyond their control. Circumstances should be \nexceptional to compel the protected person to act without regard for their own safety and well-being and \ndisregard for potential consequences. In the absence of exceptional circumstances beyond the protected \nperson’s control that compel the protected person to act, the protected person’s actions should be \nconsidered voluntary. \n \n2. Intention: The person must intend by their action to reavail themselves of the protection of the \ncountry of their nationality. \n \nThe intent of the protected person must be considered in order to determine whether the act was \nundertaken for the purpose of obtaining protection. Consideration should be given to actual reavailment of \nprotection compared to occasional and incidental contact with national authorities. Every case must be \nassessed on its own merits and on the basis of the particular actions undertaken by the protected person. \n \nSpeaking in the context of reavailment outside of one’s country of nationality, the UNHCR guidelines from \n1999, “The Cessation Clauses: Guidelines on their Application” (UNHCR Guidelines), state that the \nprotection obtained is the diplomatic protection by the country of nationality of the protected person. This \nprotection relates to the actions that a State is entitled to undertake in relation to other States in order to \nobtain redress for its nationals. Diplomatic protection may also include consular assistance. However \n“most ordinary contacts with diplomatic missions for the purpose of certification of academic documents, \nor for the purpose of obtaining copies of birth, marital, and other records, are not considered as acts \nwhich carry the intention of re-availment of the protection of the country of origin” (UNHCR Guidelines, \nparagraph 10). \n \nApplications by refugees for the issuance or extension of national passports will normally imply an \nintention to entrust the protection of their interests to, or to re-establish normal relations with, their country \nof nationality. This implication may, however, be rebutted by the refugee. The key issue is the purpose or \nreason for which the passport was obtained or renewed (UNHCR Guidelines, paragraph 10). In Canada \n(Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. Bashir, 2015 FC 51, the Federal Court found that the\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n39 \n \n \nRPD acknowledged there was a presumption of intention to reavail (because Mr. Bashir obtained a \nnational passport), but the explanations provided were sufficient to rebut that presumption; in Li v. \nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration, 2015 FC 459, the Federal Court upheld the RPD finding that Mr. \nLi had not rebutted the presumption of re-availment. \n \nThe Federal Court, in Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. Bashir, 2015 FC 51, \nsuggested that obtaining a national passport without actually travelling to the country of nationality is not \nlikely sufficient to cease refugee protection, however each case must be assessed on the basis of its own \ncircumstances as the Federal Court added that this is not to imply that a refugee who does not intend to \nuse their passport to travel to their country of nationality could never be found to have had the intention of \nreavailing themselves of the protection of their country of nationality. In Bashir, the Federal Court held \nthat it was open to the RPD, in light of the evidence, to conclude that, by renewing his passport with the \nintention to use it to travel to a third country to see his parents, the refugee did not intend to reavail \nhimself of the protection of Pakistan and that it is difficult to see how the renewal of a national status for \nthe purpose of submitting it to IRCC to finalize the permanent residence process can been seen as \nreavailing himself of the protection of Pakistan. In the Federal Court’s view, the RPD has a mandate to \nassess the refugee’s motivation in order to determine whether he intended to reavail himself of the \nprotection of his country of nationality when he renewed his national passport for the purpose of \ntravelling. \n \nThe Federal Court, in Makeen v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), IMM-1862-14 (unreported), \nendorsed the view that it is doubtful that the renewal of a passport on its own is sufficient to establish an \nintention to reavail. In Makeen, the Federal Court upheld the RPD’s decision allowing the Minister’s \napplication for cessation under paragraph A108(1)(a). The RPD concluded that by renewing his passport \nand returning to his country of nationality on two occasions, Mr. Makeen had voluntarily reavailed himself \nof the protection of Sri Lanka. The RPD found that Mr. Makeen had not provided any credible and \ncompelling reasons for renewing his national passport and returning to Sri Lanka. \n \nIn Siddiqui v. Citizenship and Immigration, 2015 FC 329, when considering whether the applicant had the \nintention to reavail himself of the protection of his country of nationality, the Federal Court stated that the \napplicant’s first trip back to Afghanistan to visit his sick father cannot be sufficient alone to justifiy \nreavailment. However, the Federal Court confirmed the RPD decision to cease his refugee protection, as \nthe applicant had subsquently travelled back to Afghanistan for businesss reasons. \n \nRefugee protection for minor children can be ceased along with their parents’, but intention must still be \nassessed. The parents’ intention to reavail will form the requisite intent for a minor child to reavail, as a \nminor child cannot form an intention that is different from their parents’. There must be further analysis \nundertaken to determine whether an older child is capable of forming an intention that is different from \ntheir parents’ [Cabrera Cadena v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FC 67, \nparagraph 31]. Such analysis can occur in interviews or by examination in the hearing room. \n \n3. Reavailment: The person must actually obtain such protection. \n \nAccording to the UNHCR Handbook, a protected person who has requested protection from theircountry \nof nationality has only “reavailed” when protection has been granted. The most frequent case of \n“reavailment of protection” will be where the refugee wishes to return to their country of nationality. They \nwill not cease to be a refugee merely by applying for repatriation. On the other hand, obtaining an entry \npermit or a national passport for the purposes of returning is, in the absence of proof to the contrary,\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n40 \n \n \nconsidered terminating refugee status [UNHCR Handbook, paragraph 122]. The presumption applies to a \nrefugee who is still outside of their country [Cabrera Cadena v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness), 2012 FC 67, para.24]. \n \nNote: In general, obtaining a national passport on its own is insufficient for the hearings officer to file an \napplication for cessation under paragraph A108(1)(a). The actions undertaken by the protected person, \nincluding the reasons for obtaining the passport, should be examined closely to determine if other \ncircumstances or facts exist to support an application under paragraph A108(1)(a). \n \nEl Kaissi v. Canada (MCI) 2011 FC 1234; Shanmugarajah v. Canada (MEI), [1992] F.C.J. No 583; and \nRibeiro v. Canada (MCI) 2005 FC 1363 are decisions related to reavailment in the event of pressing \nneed, such as taking care of a parent. \n \n6.6 Paragraph A108(1)(b): The person has voluntarily re-acquired their \nnationality. \n \nParagraph 126 of the UNHCR Handbook instructs that this provision applies in situations where a \nprotected person, having lost the nationality of the country in respect of which a well-founded fear was \nrecognized, voluntarily reacquires that nationality. \n \nOfficers should consider the following, as outlined in paragraph 128 of the UNHCR Handbook, when \ndeciding whether to apply to cease refugee protection under paragraph 108(1)(b): \n \n \nreacquisition of nationality must be voluntary; and \n \nthere is an act of reacquisition of citizenship that is truly indicative of a normalization of relations \nbetween the refugee and the state of origin; the refugee must have the desire to establish normal \nrelations with their country of nationality or to benefit from the advantages of the nationality of \ntheir country. \n \nThe reacquisition of nationality must be voluntary. The granting of nationality by operation of law or by \ndecree does not imply voluntary reacquisition, unless the nationality has been expressly or impliedly \naccepted. The “mere possibility of reacquiring the lost nationality by exercising a right of option [is not] \nsufficient to put an end to refugee status, unless this option has actually been exercised. However, where \nthe laws give an option to reject the attribution of nationality and the refugee, with full knowledge of the \noption, does not exercise it, then the refugee could be deemed to have voluntarily reacquired the former \nnationality” [UNHCR Guidelines, paragraph 14], unless they are able to invoke special reasons showing \nthat it was not in fact their intention to reacquire their former nationality [UNHCR Handbook, paragraph \n128]. \n \n6.7 Paragraph A108(1)(c): The person has acquired a new nationality \nand enjoys the protection of the country of that new nationality. \n \nThis requirement, as outlined in paragraph 130 of the UNHCR Handbook, extends from the phrase “and \nenjoys the protection of the country of that new nationality.” Nationality is restricted to citizenship and \ndoes not include permanent resident status. \n \nTwo conditions must be met when considering this ground:\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n41 \n \n \n \nThe person has acquired a new nationality, usually after being found to be a refugee in Canada \nagainst another country. For example, a citizen of country A is found to be a refugee in Canada \nand subsequently obtains citizenship from country B. \n \nThe person enjoys the protection of the country of that new nationality. For example, the person \nenjoys, in practice, fundamental rights that result from holding that nationality, including the right \nof non-refoulement. \n \nThe possession of a passport of another country is insufficient evidence if the bearer is not considered a \nnational of that country. In assessing whether a protected person is a national of another country, the \napplicable law and actual administrative practice of that country must be taken into consideration. \n \n6.8 Paragraph A108(1)(d): The person has voluntarily become re- \nestablished in the country that the person left or remained outside of \nand in respect of which the person claimed refugee protection in \nCanada. \n \nA protected person must voluntarily return to become re-established in their country of origin or former \nhabitual residence. A protected person voluntarily re-establishes themselves in the country of origin or \nformer habitual residence when the intent of the return is to permanently reside there (UNHCR \nHandbook, paragraph 134). \n \nTemporary returns may, however, constitute re-establishment under paragraph 108(1)(d) if such visits are \nprolonged and frequent with evidence of attachment. It can be argued that a regular presence in the state \nof origin for a significant part of the year is prima facie-inconsistent with a continued need for protection. \n \nThere are no defined criteria as to when a person could be considered re-established. The length of stay \nis only one possible factor in determining re-establishment. The protected person’s sense of commitment \nin regard to the stay in the country of origin or former habitual residence should be considered. If the \nprotected person remained and held a normal livelihood and performed obligations of a normal citizen, \nthen cessation may be warranted, regardless of the duration of the stay, given that this is indicative of a \nnormalization of relations with the country. \n \nRe-establishment was addressed in the following decisions: X (Re), 2011 CanLII 100748 (CA IRB) and X \n(Re), 2011 CanLII 100780 (CA IRB). \n \nA cessation application should be considered in absentia when the protected person has returned to their \ncountry of origin or former habitual residence and evidence indicates the person left Canada to become \nre-established in their country of origin or former habitual residence. However, this does not remove the \nobligation to serve the application to cease refugee protection in accordance with subrule 64(3) of the \nRPDR. \n \n6.9 Paragraph A108(1)(e): The reasons for which the person sought \nrefugee protection have ceased to exist. \n \nThis provision is based on consideration that protection is no longer justified because the reasons for a \nperson becoming a protected person have ceased to exist. Often, this will be the case due to changes in \ncountry conditions where persecution was feared.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n42 \n \n \nIn Winifred v. Canada (MCI), 2011 FC 827, the Federal Court outlined the following conditions that must \nbe met before invoking paragraph A108(1)(e) on the ground that changes in country condition occurred: \n \n \nthe change must be of substantial political significance; \n \nthere must be reason to believe that the substantial political change is truly effective; and \n \nthe change of circumstances must be shown to be durable. \n \nFactors which assist in determining whether there has been a significant, effective, and durable political \nor social change include democratic elections, significant reforms to the legal and social structures of the \nstate, amnesties, repealing of repressive laws, dismantling of repressive security forces, and an overall \ngeneral respect for human rights. Additional examples include \n \n \ngenocide in a country after which the international community has intervened; \n \nprolonged war that has come to an end; and \n \npersecution of a particular group ends due to a change in regime. \n \nIn Youssef v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999), the Federal Court provides some \nguidance as to how the above-mentioned conditions may not always be applicable in the \nparagraph A108(1)(e) context. \n \nMs. Youssef was granted refugee status on the grounds that she feared her violent and abusive husband. \nMs. Youssef subsequently tried to include her husband in her application for permanent residence. She \ntold both IRCC and the RPD at her cessation hearing that her husband had changed, her children needed \nhim, and he had acknowledged that he was wrong. \n \nThe Minister of IRCC filed a cessation application on the grounds that the reasons for which the RPD \ngranted refugee status to Ms. Youssef, namely her fear of her husband, had ceased to exist. The RPD \nagreed and allowed the application. \n \nIn Youssef, the Federal Court concluded that a change of circumstance is a question of fact and that \nthere is no separate, legal test by which any alleged change in circumstances must be measured. The \nuse of words such as “meaningful,” “effective,” or “durable” is only helpful, Justice Teitelbaum says, if one \nkeeps clearly in mind that the only question, and therefore the only test, is one derived from the definition \nof Convention Refugee in section A2: does the claimant now have a well-founded fear of persecution? At \nparagraph 21, Justice Teitelbaum concluded the following: “Whether the situation is a political change of \ncircumstances in one’s country of origin or simply a change in the personal circumstances of an individual \nfor which that individual claimed refugee status, as it is a question of fact, the Board could conclude, on \nthe evidence before it, that the ‘original’ fear the applicant had no longer exists.” \n \nAt paragraph 22, Justice Teitelbaum stated the following: “When an application is made… for a \ndetermination of cessation of refugee status, the burden to show that there is a cessation of refugee \nstatus rests on the Minister. That is, the evidence that must be brought before the Board, by the Minister, \nin a [cessation] application, to ‘satisfy its burden of proof’ is not always the same. It depends on the \nparticular circumstances.” \n \nIn circumstances such as in Youssef, when dealing with a change in personal circumstances of an \nindividual’s previously abusive husband, the burden to show that the husband has changed and that the \nchange is a durable change does not rest with the Minister. Justice Teitelbaum stated at paragraph 31 \nthat it is impossible for the IRB to determine how “durable” the “change of circumstances” is in a case\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n43 \n \n \nsuch as Youssef, and that it is sufficient that the IRB be satisfied that the “change of circumstances” is \nsignificant and effective. \n \n6.10 Subsection A108(4): Exception to paragraph A108(1)(e) \n \nArticle 1C(5) of the Refugee Convention provides for an exception to the ground expressed under \nparagraph A108(1)(e), when a protected person is “able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of \nprevious persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality.” \nParagraph 136 of the UNHCR Handbook states that the exception reflects a general humanitarian \nprinciple that those who have “suffered under atrocious forms of persecution should not be expected to \nrepatriate.” For example, the RPD may grant a person who has been tortured by the authorities of their \ncountry of nationality the exception of having compelling reasons for not wanting to return to their country. \nThis concept is incorporated in Canada’s domestic legislation at subsection A108(4). The Federal Court \nof Appeal noted the exceptional circumstances envisaged by subsection 2(3) of the Immigration Act, now \nsubsection A108(4), would apply to only a minority [M.E.I. v. Obstoj, [1992] 2 F.C. 739 (C.A.)]. The \nprinciples developed in the case law relating to subsection 2(3) of the former Immigration Act are \napplicable to subsection A108(4). \n \nThe decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Belouadah (2013-05-10 IMM-10536- \n12) outlines the procedure RPD members must follow when determining whether to use the exception of \ncompelling reasons under subsection A108(4) in the context of a refugee hearing.Members must \n \n \nacknowledge that the person was at some point in time a Convention refugee [A96] or a person in \nneed of protection [A97]; \n \ncome to the conclusion that paragraph A108(1)(e) applies since there is a change in country \nconditions; and \n \ndetermine, once the two steps above have been completed, if compelling reasons exist to warrant \nthe retention of protected person status pursuant to subsection A108(4). \n \n6.11 Multiple cessation grounds including paragraph A108(1)(e): The \ntemporal aspect \n \nOnce an officer is satisfied that there is a prima facie case for one of the cessation grounds set out in \nsubsection A108(1), the officer is not required to, but may, conduct a further investigation or assessment \nas to whether a prima facie case exists for any of the other grounds set out in subsection A108(1). \n \nWhen there are multiple cessation clauses, and one of those clauses is paragraph A108(1)(e) and the \nother(s) is/are one or more of paragraphs A108(1)(a), A108(1)(b), or A108(1)(d), then a temporal aspect \ncomes into play (Note: paragraph 108(1)(c) has been intentionally excluded from consideration). The \napplication of the temporal aspect is as follows: \n \n1. When a prima facie case has been identified on the grounds set out in paragraph A108(1)(a), \nA108(1)(b), or A108(1)(d), and the officer does not know whether there is a prima facie case for \nparagraph A108(1)(e), then the officer is not required to conduct an assessment for a possible \ncase on the ground set out in paragraph A108(1)(e). In this circumstance, the officer should bring \nan application to the RPD on the ground(s) identified. In this circumstance, it is up to the person \nconcerned to raise any possible ground for cessation set out in paragraph A108(1)(e). The RPD \nhas the jurisdiction to decide on the applicability of any possible grounds set out in \nparagraph A108(1)(e) and on the temporal aspect of the ground set out in paragraph A108(1)(e),\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n44 \n \n \nshould it be raised by the person concerned. If the RPD decision that any ground set out in \nparagraph A108(1)(e) occurred prior to the other ground(s), is well reasoned and justified, then \nthe Minister will be satisfied, should the IRB find cessation only on the basis of \nparagraph A108(1)(e). \n2. When a prima facie case has been identified on a ground set out in paragraph A108(1)(a), \nA108(1)(b), or A108(1)(d) and (e), but the officer does not know if the ground set out in \nparagraph A108(1)(e) occurred first, then the officer is not required to conduct an assessment on \nthe temporal nature of the ground set out in paragraph A108(1)(e). In this circumstance, the \nofficer should bring an application to the RPD on all the grounds identified. The RPD has the \njurisdiction to decide on the applicability of paragraph A108(1)(e) and on the temporal aspect of \nthe ground set out in paragraph A108(1)(e). If the RPD decision that the ground set out in \nparagraph A108(1)(e) occurred prior to the other ground(s) is well reasoned and justified, then the \nMinister will be satisfied, should the IRB find cessation only on the basis of paragraph A108(1)(e). \n3. When a prima facie case has been identified on a ground set out in paragraph A108(1)(e), and \nthe officer knows that it occurred prior to the other ground(s) for cessation, which has/have been \nidentified under paragraphs A108(1)(a), A108(1)(b), or A108(1)(c), then the officer should not \nbring forward an application for cessation to the RPD. This is only when the officer has such \nknowledge. \n \nThe rationale behind this position is that a prior change in country conditions or personal circumstance, \nas the case may be, which led to the conclusion that the reasons for which the person sought refugee \nprotection have ceased to exist, would by necessary implication be the basis for the person concerned \nhaving later re-availed themselves of the protection of the country against which they had claimed \nrefugee protection, reacquired their nationality, or re-established themselves in this country. \n \n6.12 Consequences of cessation of refugee protection \n \nLoss of permanent residence and inadmissibility \n \nOn June 28, 2012, the IRPA was amended to provide for the loss of permanent resident status by \noperation of law when protected person status is lost as a result of a final determination by the RPD \nunder subsection A108(2) that refugee protection has ceased for the reasons outlined in \nparagraphs A108(1)(a) to A108(1)(d) [A46(1)(c.1)]. In Silvia Olvera Romero v. Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration 2014 FC 671, par. 130, the Federal Court stated that \"the fact that the applicant was granted \nrefugee protection and permanent residency status at a time when the disputed provisions [A46(1)(c.1)] \nwere not in effect does not mean that new legislation would not apply to her. Further, while the facts that \nmay underlie the RPD's determination occurred before the subject amendments came into force, this \nwould not, in my view, change their effect\" (see also Li v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC \n459). \n \nAll persons who lose their permanent resident status under paragraph A46(1)(c.1) are, therefore, foreign \nnationals for the purposes of the admissibility provisions set out in section A40.1. \n \nSubsection A40.1(1) states that a foreign national is inadmissible on a final determination by the RPD for \nany of the grounds cited in subsection A108(1) [A40.1(1)]. It is the Minister’s position that \nsubsection A40.1(1) applies to foreign nationals who were ceased under paragraphs A108(1)(a) to \nA108(1)(e) as well as to foreign nationals who were former PRs who lost their permanent resident status \nunder paragraph A46(1)(c.1) as a consequence of being ceased under paragraphs A108(1)(a) to \nA108(1)(d). Consequently, a removal order for inadmissibility under section 40.1 need only make \nreference to subsection 40.1(1).\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n45 \n \n \nParagraph R228(1)(b.1) establishes that a departure order is the appropriate removal order when a \nforeign national is inadmissible under subsection A40.1(1) on grounds of the cessation of refugee \nprotection. \n \nVarious bars \n \nBecause cessation is considered a rejection of the claim for refugee protection (see subsection A108(1)), \nthe one-year Humanitarian and Compassionate Considerations bar under paragraph A25(1.2)(c) and the \none- or three-year Pre-Removal Risk Assessment bar—depending whether or not the foreign national is \nfrom a designated country of origin—under paragraph A112(2)(b.1) apply. \n \nA decision of the RPD allowing or rejecting a cessation application by the Minister cannot be appealed to \nthe RAD pursuant to paragraph A110(2)(e). \n \n6.13 Cessation within a refugee hearing \n \nThe grounds for cessation set out in subsection A108(1) can be invoked in the context of a refugee \nhearing as well as of an application to cease a person’s protected status. \n \nThe following are examples of when paragraph A108(1)(e) would apply in a refugee hearing context: \n \n \nA person had a well-founded fear of persecution at the time of fleeing their country and/or at the \ntime of making their refugee claim, but the reasons for which the person sought refugee \nprotection have ceased to exist prior to the conclusion of the RPD hearing. \n \n7 Vacation \n \nPursuant to subsection A109(1), the RPD may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow \na claim for refugee protection if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly \nmisrepresenting or withholding material facts. \n \nIn Bayat v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999, FCA 9354 [Imm 338-95], the Federal \nCourt upheld the order of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) (now the RPD) to \nvacate the Convention refugee status of Mr. Bayat and his family, who had been determined to be \nConvention refugees by a visa officer. \n \nBy PRRA under section A114 \n \nThe Minister of IRCC has the authority to annul or set aside a decision to allow a PRRA application that \nwas obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts on a \nrelevant matter. The authority to vacate a decision is contained in subsection A114(3). When a PRRA \ndecision is vacated, the decision is nullified, and the application for protection is deemed to have been \nrejected at the time of the decision to vacate [A114(4)] (refer to PP3). \n \n7.1 Direct vs. indirect misrepresentation \n \nSection A109 includes misrepresentations made by one claimant on behalf of all of the members of their\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n46 \n \n \nfamily. \n \nWang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1059, in the context of an appeal \nfrom an Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) decision, the court found that indirectly misrepresenting means \nmisrepresentation by another person. \n \n7.2 Misrepresentation or withholding material facts \n \nThe concept of \"misrepresentation of a material fact\" is broader than simple fraud or fraudulent means. It \nincludes both intentional and unintentional concealment or suppression of facts. Where a \nmisrepresentation has the effect of “averting further inquiries,” it can be said to be material. \n \n \nCanada (Minister of Manpower and Immigration) v. Brooks, [1974] S.C.R. 850 at 873. \n \nMohammed v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] 3 FC 299. \n \nNur v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 636. \n \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Pearce, 2006 FC 492. \n \nThe court held that whether or not the respondent had the intellectual capacity to understand or the \nintention to misrepresent the facts or withhold material facts is not relevant. Withholding material facts \noccurs when certain facts are omitted in the application for refugee protection. \n \nThe case of Khamsei v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1981] 1 F.C. 222 (Fed. C.A.) \naddressed the question of material misrepresentation as follows: \n \n“Materiality, in my opinion, is a question of fact. But that does not mean that there must be direct \nevidence that, but for the misrepresentation, the visa would not have been granted. The fact of \nmateriality may be inferred.” \n \nIn Singh Chahil v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 1214, the court stated the \nissue of identity is fundamental to a refugee claim. \n \n7.3 Relevant matter \n \nA relevant matter is a fact that, if not disclosed, could result in an error in the administration of the IRPA in \nrelation to granting Convention refugee protection. \n \nIn Zheng v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 619, the court found that the \nmisrepresentation of the claimant’s original entry to Canada by using a valid passport issued by the \nCommonwealth of Dominica was a misrepresentation of fact on a relevant issue because its disclosure \nwould reasonably have called for the original panel to examine whether or not the Commonwealth of \nDominica was a country of reference. \n \n7.4 Application to vacate \n \nThe application to vacate must be in writing and must follow the format outlined in rules 50 and 64 of the \nRPDR.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n47 \n \n \nFor general principles applying to vacation, see Wahab v. Canada (MCI), 2006 FC 1554. \n \nA vacation application is adversarial, and the burden of proof rests on the Minister to show why the \nperson's refugee protection should be vacated according to Nur v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2005 FC 636. \n \nStandard of proof \n \nThe Minister’s application has to create a prima facie case for the RPD to grant the application. The \nburden then shifts to the respondent to rebut the Minister’s case. The standard of proof required to create \na prima facie case is a balance of probabilities. A prima facie case is one in which the Minister’s evidence \nwould reasonably allow the conclusion that the Minister seeks and, in fact, compels such a conclusion if \nthe claimant produces no evidence to rebut it. \n \n \nHaji-Dodi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1996] IMM-2908-94, F.C.J. No. \n438. \n \nThe Minister sought to call the respondent as a witness to support the application to vacate. The \nrespondent’s counsel objected that the respondent was not a compellable witness and that he had been \ngiven no notice that he would be called to testify. The court held that the tribunal did not err in law in \ndetermining that the respondent should not be compelled to testify in circumstances where no evidence \nhad been presented at the hearing by the Minister, and the documentary evidence presented in support \nof the vacation application in advance of the hearing was not entirely satisfactory. In other words, the \nMinister’s materials must establish a prima facie case to which the respondent might be expected to reply. \n \nIf the Minister’s application does not establish a prima facie case, the hearings officer may not be allowed \nto question the respondent. However, if counsel for the respondent calls their client as a witness, the \nhearings officer will be in a position to question. Finally, if counsel for the respondent does not call the \nrespondent to rebut, the hearings officer can rest the Minister’s case based on the documentation filed in \nthe application. \n \nNote: If the person is a Canadian citizen, before taking any actions, the hearings officer is to contact the \nCase Management Branch at IRCC, Citizenship Unit, via email to coordinate the approach for these \ncases. \n \n7.5 Rejection of application – Subsection A109(2) \n \nThe RPD may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the \ntime of the first refugee determination to justify refugee protection. \n \nThe application to vacate is a two-step process (see Shahzad v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2011 FC 905). The RPD must decide if \n \n1. the misrepresentation is material; and \n2. there is any untainted evidence from the first hearing that would justify refugee protection. \n \n7.6 New evidence\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n48 \n \n \nNew evidence is excluded from the vacation hearing. The claimant cannot introduce new evidence to \nsupport the refugee claim but can introduce evidence to rebut the Minister’s evidence. \n \nThe principle of new evidence was articulated in the Federal Court of Appeal decisions of \nCoomaraswamy v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 153, [2002] 4 FC 501 \nand Annalingam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 281. When attempting to \nestablish that a claimant made misrepresentations at the refugee determination hearing, the Minister may \nadduce evidence at the vacation hearing that was not before the IRB at the initial hearing, and the \nclaimant may present new evidence in an attempt to persuade the IRB that they did not make the \nmisrepresentations according to Waraich v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC \n1257 and Gunasingam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 181. \n \nAccording to Thambipillai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (F.C.T.D., IMM-5279-98, \nJuly 22, 1999), the Minister can introduce evidence which was available at the time of the first hearing but \nof which the Minister was not aware during that hearing (for instance, CSIS reports that have become \navailable after the original hearing). \n \nThe Minister can also introduce and rely on new developments in areas of law to be considered during \nthe vacation hearing, such as new jurisprudence in the area of exclusion [Duraisamy v. Canada (Minister \nof Citizenship and Immigration), (F.C.T.D., IMM-6216-99, November 24, 2000)]. \n \nIn Sethi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1178 (CanLII) and Bortey v. \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 190, the Federal Court held that the RPD \nmust determine if any of the evidence cited in support of the original positive decision is left “untainted.” \n \nThis refers to situations where there has been a misrepresentation or withholding of material facts by the \nperson concerned, but there is sufficient evidence remaining from the original hearing after the \nmisrepresentations or omissions have been subtracted to justify continued refugee protection. \n \nIn Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Fouodji, 2005, FC 1327, the Federal Court \ndetermined that the RPD failed to observe a principle of natural justice and proceedural fairness by failing \nto provide adequate reasons to support its decision to reject the Minister’s application to vacate. “The \npanel did not set out clearly and explicitly what part of the remaining evidence filed before the first panel \nremained credible and why it was credible”. “In fact, the evidence relied on by the member involves the \nsituation of women in Cameroon in general and does not relate to the respondent in particular. Without \nevidence relating to the respondent in particular, the IRB could not in this way find a reason to justify \nallowing the respondent’s refugee claim. According to subsection A109(2), the existence of documentary \nevidence regarding the general situation of a country is not in itself sufficient to justify a person’s refugee \nprotection.” \n \nIt should be noted that the Minister and the person concerned do not have a right to appeal a rejected \napplication to the RAD pursuant to paragraph A110(2)(f). \n \n7.7 Allowance of an application: Subsection A109(3) \n \nIf the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed rejected, and the decision that led to the \nconferral of refugee protection is nullified.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n49 \n \n \nThe effect of vacating a refugee claim and the consequent nullification of refugee protection would render \na claimant ineligible, under paragraph A101(1)(b), to make a further claim. \n \nPursuant to paragraph A46(1)(d), vacation of refugee protection also leads to a loss of permanent \nresident status. \n \nIn order to effect the removal of the person concerned, a subsection A44(1) report is written as follows: \n \n \nSubsection 40(1) misrepresentation – A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible \nfor misrepresentation. \n \nParagraph 40(1)(c) misrepresentation – A permanent resident or a foreign national is \ninadmissible for misrepresentation on a final determination to vacate a decision to allow their \nclaim for refugee protection or application for protection. \n \nPursuant to subsection A40(2), a permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible for \nmisrepresentation for five years. \n \nA Minister’s delegate has the authority to issue a deportation order under paragraph R228(1)(b) \nfor this allegation in the case of a foreign national. \n \n7.8 Exclusion in the context of a vacation application \n \nAn assessment of evidence that may exclude a refugee claimant from protection pursuant to articles E \nand F of the Refugee Convention is part of any hearing determining whether a person is a Convention \nrefugee. This means that the decision maker considering the application to vacate may consider any new \nevidence adduced by either the Minister or the individual in order to determine whether article 1F of the \nRefugee Convention applies. \n \nRefer to: Thambipillai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 8413 (F.C.); \nMahdi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (1995), 191 N.R. 170 (F.C.A.); Aleman v. \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FC 710; and Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration) v. Yaqoob, 2005 FC 1017. \n \nIn the case of Aleman v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 710, the court held \nthat the vacation panel was clearly entitled to consider the new evidence regarding the alleged crimes \nagainst humanity of the applicant (a member of the Salvadoran army), which was not before the original \npanel. The panel must be able to establish whether or not the applicant would have been excluded from \nConvention refugee status under article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention, had he revealed such evidence \nat the original hearing. \n \nOnce the RPD concludes that the applicant is excluded under article 1F or 1E of the Refugee Convention, \nthe remaining evidence does not have to be examined with regard to the application of subsection \nA109(2), since the RPD cannot grant refugee protection to an individual described in section A98. \n \nAlso refer to Parvanta v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1146 (CanLII) \nconcerning vacation and exclusion under article 1E of the Refugee Convention and Frias v. Canada \n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 753 for exclusion under article 1F(b) of the Refugee \nConvention.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n50 \n \n \n8 Procedure: Roles and responsibilities \n \nIRCC is responsible for ministerial interventions involving program integrity and credibility issues as well \nas for cases where exclusion under article 1E of the Refugee Convention arises. \n \nThe CBSA continues to intervene in cases that involve serious criminality and security concerns and is \nresponsible for hybrid cases (i.e., combined program integrity/credibility issues and criminality or security \nconcerns). Where a case is determined to be a hybrid case, and the Minister of PSEP elects not to \npursue the criminality or security ground, the CBSA has made a comittment to IRCC to go forward on \ngrounds of credibility or program integrity. \n \nRefer to Appendix E for the national directive regarding credibility and program integrity interventions. \n \n8.1 Hearings officers representing the Minister of PSEP or the Minister \nof IRCC \n \nHearings officers represent the Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC in hearings before all divisions of \nthe IRB. \n \nIn this capacity, hearings officers \n \n \nare in direct contact with counsel and clients; \n \nare the representatives of the Minister; and \n \nmust show professionalism at all times, in particular in their telephone manner, their written \ncorrespondence, their conduct at hearings, and all other interactions with the public. \n \nNote: Professionalism shall be exhibited by preparing adequately for cases and by treating all \nparticipants at a hearing, including claimants, members, counsel, witnesses, interpreters, and observers, \nwith dignity and respect. \n \n8.2 Roles and responsibilities of hearings officers at RPD hearings \n \nThe hearings officer is responsible for presenting evidence, cross-examining witnesses, and defending \nthe position of the Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as the case may be, in arguments relating to \njurisdictional matters or questions raised by the Charter. \n \nThe hearings officer may address questions that concern the merits of the refugee protection claim, but \nthis task is normally left to the RPD member. \n \nClaimants are more likely to be cooperative if they are not frightened and confused. Refugee hearings are \nusually non-adversarial; however, when the Minister intervenes, the hearing may become adversarial. \n \nIn performing their responsibilities, hearings officers have a duty to treat all parties, including the claimant, \nwith respect. This includes \n \n \nshowing sensitivity, especially towards claimants, many of whom have had traumatic\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n51 \n \n \nexperiences, including torture or rape; \n \nobtaining the relevant facts and bringing forward arguments (such steps are perfectly compatible \nwith respectful and sensitive communication); \n \nadopting a moderate and respectful tone and being aware of body language that may be \nperceived as aggressive; \n \nconsidering carefully if any questions concerning sensitive points are really necessary before \nasking them; and \n \nmonitoring the claimant’s reaction to the questions posed and, if the claimant seems to be \ndistressed, considering modifying the approach in order to make the claimant more comfortable. \n \nWhen making comments, the hearings officer must respect the dignity of the refugee claimant by avoiding \n \n \nsarcasm or insults; \n \nreferences to aspects that are not relevant to the case; and \n \na condescending tone. \n \n8.3 Role of hearings officers in preparing a case \n \nIn preparing a case, a hearings officer must \n \n \nresearch and gather evidence pertaining to the exclusion ground, credibility, or program \nintegrity issue; this may involve contacting visa offices overseas, requesting an inland \ninvestigation, searching the internet for particular groups, and/or determining jurisprudence \nrelating to the exclusion issue, etc.; \n \nensure that all documents on which the Minister intends to rely during the hearing are \ndisclosed to all parties pursuant to the RPDR. \n \nensure that all documents on which the RPD and counsel intend to rely have been disclosed \nto the hearings officer; the hearings officer should request the RPD exhibit list before the \nhearing and check it closely to ensure that the hearings officer has all the documents; \n \nreview all documents pertaining to the claim and take note of inconsistencies; and \n \nplan the issues to be addressed in cross examination and determine potential witnesses. \n \nThe hearings officer has a duty to determine if there are any particularly sensitive issues. For example, \nthe claimant may \n \n \nallege having been tortured; \n \nhave been a witness to a massacre; or \n \nhave been detained in a place where torture was practised or have been in contact with \nmilitary forces accused of systematic rape. \n \nWhere a pre-hearing conference is held, there is an opportunity to reduce the number of sensitive issues \nthat will have to be dealt with at the hearing. \n \nHearings officers should read the IRB’s Chairperson’s Guidelines, which provide guidance on child \nrefugee claimants, detained claimants, and vulnerable persons. The Chairperson’s Guidelines are \navailable at the following link: http://www.irb- \ncisr.gc.ca/Eng/brdcom/references/pol/guidir/Pages/index.aspx.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n52 \n \n \nNote: Hearings officers should be aware that behaviour that seems off-putting may have rational \nexplanations. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder or cultural differences may account for some \nbehaviours. \n \n9 Procedure: Maintaining the integrity of the program at the RPD \n \n9.1 File triage and assessment \n \nIRCC and CBSA refugee intake officers are required to scan all intake documents, including the Basis of \nClaim form, the appropriate IMM 0008 form, Schedule A, and officer notes, if applicable, and send them \nthrough the electronic sharing folder to the triage office closest to where the RPD hearing will be held. \nOnce CBSA and IRCC officers have access to GCMS, all the aforementionned documents will be \ndownloaded in GCMS instead of sending them through the electroninc sharing folder. \n \nPort of entry, CBSA inland and IRCC refugee intake officers should flag and note in FOSS/GCMS any \npotential cases which may warrant an intervention by the Minister. \n \nTriage offices to review all claims for possible intervention have been set up in Vancouver (CBSA), \nMontréal (CBSA), and Toronto (IRCC). \n \nIRCC and the CBSA have developed the following list of triggers or screening criteria for cases to be \nreferred for potential intervention: \n \nReferrals to IRCC \n \n \npossible status in a third country (exclusion under article 1E of the Refugee Convention); \n \nmultiple nationalities; \n \npossible multiple identities; \n \nhigh-profile case with no criminality or security issues; \n \nprevious Canadian immigration history (e.g., adverse, visa-related information; previous \nmisrepresentation); \n \nmigration trends (officers must will be told which trends to look for, as this will vary over time); \n \nclaim initiated more than 6 months after entry to Canada; \n \nclaimant was subject to a Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) exception at intake; or \n \nfile was transferred for other reasons (e.g., major discrepancy, contraditions in dates provided, \nstory changes between port of entry and basis of claim forms). \n \nReferrals to the CBSA \n \n \nan indication of criminality; \n \nan indication of participation in or membership in a group that has engaged in espionage, \nsubversion of a government, or terrorism; \n \nan indication of involvement in war crimes or crimes against humanity; \n \nan indication of organized criminality (i.e., human smuggling or human trafficking); \n \npresent or past detention of the claimant; \n \nan irregular arrival designation (DFN);\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n53 \n \n \n \nCharter challenges; or \n \nhybrid cases. \n \nOnce the electronic file containing the refugee intake documents is sent to the triage centre, the file \nreview is conducted to identify potential invervention by the CBSA or IRCC. The triage workflow is as \nfollows: \n \n1. Receive the initial refugee claim intake documents. \n2. Prioritize case (e.g., designated country of origin vs. non-designated country of origin; detained \nvs. non-detained; port of entry vs. inland). \n3. Conduct triage activities using the relevant departmental triage checklists. \n4. Record findings on the Triage Checklist and in NCMS/GCMS. \n5. Refer to the CBSA or IRCC R&I Unit, retain for further review within own department, or put away \n(i.e., no further action required). \n \nWhen the claim is made at the port of entry, the claimant will have 15 days to send the completed basis of \nclaim form to the IRB. Once the IRB receives this form, they will send a copy of the completed basis of \nclaim form to the appropriate triage centre for screening. \n \nCases determined to have program integrity and/or credibility issues or exclusion grounds under \narticle 1E of the Refugee Convention will be referred to the appropriate IRCC R&I office via the managed \nsecure file transfer (MSFT) for further review and potential intervention. \n \nAll identified cases excluded under article 1F of the Refugee Convention (i.e., serious criminality, war \ncrimes, crimes against humanity, acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations), all \ntypes of criminality, irregular arrivals, Charter challenges, security (i.e., subversion, terrorism), organized \ncrime (i.e., human smuggling or trafficking), and detained and/or hybrid cases (i.e., combined program \nintegrity/credibility issues and security/criminality) will be referred to the appropriate CBSA hearings office \nvia the MSFT within five (5) calendar days of receipt for further review for intervention. \n \nIf the triage centre does not identify potential exclusion or program/credibility issues, the case will be \nclosed and put away. The triage staff will make the appropriate entries in NCMS and will send the paper \nfile to the appropriate IRCC or CBSA inland office. \n \nIf additional documents, including port of entry basis of claim forms and amended basis of claim forms, \nare received by the triage centre after the triage is completed, and no intervention grounds were \npreviously identified, another triage will be conducted. An additional triage checklist will be completed and \nsent, along with the new document(s), to the appropriate IRCC R&I Office or the appropriate CBSA \nhearings office if the new information leads to a referral for possible intervention. \n \nOnce a file is referred to a hearings office for possible intervention, the hearings officer should review the \ntriage checklist and the reasons for the referral to determine if the file contains information that might \nrequire further investigation and/or if there is sufficient information on file to warrant filing an intervention. \nSection 5.5 and Tables 4 and 5 of this manual chapter list factors to consider for each type of case, but \nthis is not an exhaustive list. Pursuant to rule 29 of the RPDR, if the Minister wishes to intervene in a \nclaim, the Minister must provide both the claimant and the RPD with the notice to intervene and must \nindicate the following:\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n54 \n \n \na) the purpose of the Minister’s intervention; \nb) whether the Minister will intervene in person, in writing, or both; and \nc) contact information for the Minister’s representative (hearings officer). \n \nIf the hearings officer is of the opinion that an exclusion clause applies, the notice of intervention must \ninclude the facts and law on which the Minister relies. All documents provided in the notice of intervention \nmust be received no later than 10 days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. \n \nIf the hearings officer, after reviewing the case, is of the opinion that the refugee protection claim does not \nrequire intervention or other action, the reasons for non-participation should be noted, and NCMS and \nGCMS should be updated accordingly. The claim will follow the normal course at the RPD for \ndetermination of the right to refugee protection without ministerial participation. \n \n9.2 Investigation \n \nIf information has to be checked, officers or investigators may undertake verifications before determining \nif an intervention is required. These verifications are useful for adding to the information already on file or \nfor confirming or refuting certain facts. The result of the investigation will determine if an intervention is \nnecessary to pursue the case. \n \n \nCriminal and security checks \n \nCriminal, security, and medical checks are completed for all refugee claimants at the time of their arrival \nin Canada and at the triage centre that reviewed the claim. Criminal checks include \n \n \nCPIC (Canadian Police Information Centre) check; and \n \nNCIC (National Crime Information Center) check. \n \nNote: After receiving a file from the triage center, if further checks are necessary, the hearings officer \nshould request these checks, notate the file accordingly, and place the results on file. \n \n9.3 Five country conference (FCC) checks \n \nUnder the High Value Data Sharing Protocol, IRCC and the CBSA exchange biometric and biographical \ninformation with FCC partners: Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. In certain \nsituations, IRCC and CBSA officers may submit a request to have a client’s fingerprints searched against \nthe immigration fingerprint holds of an FCC partner country. Requests may be sent when there are \nreasonable grounds to believe that a refugee claimant may have come into contact with an FCC partner \ncountry and where confirmation of that contact would have an impact on any proceedings carried out \nunder the IRPA. \n \n9.4 Interpol checks \n \nInterpol checks are conducted when there is a suspicion that the claimant has been involved in criminal \nactivity in another country. To request Interpol checks in the country of alleged persecution, the approval \nof a supervisor is required.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n55 \n \n \nInterpol requests are sent to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who supply criminal \ninformation obtained through the Interpol network. When the RCMP advises that a refugee claimant has \nbeen identified as having a criminal history, additional information on foreign charges, criminal statute \ninterpretations, and penalties related to the offence should also be requested from the liaison officer at \nthe visa office in the relevant country. \n \n9.5 Front-end security screening (FESS) refugee protection claimants \nwho made a claim at a port of entry or at a CBSA or IRCC inland office \n \nThe purpose of the FESS program is to strengthen the integrity of the refugee determination process and \nenhance public security by identifying and filtering potential security cases from the refugee claimant \nstream as early as possible. \n \nAt ports of entry, security screening is requested via the Refugee Monitoring screen in FOSS. Once \nentered, the information is stored in FOSS and sent to screening partners. At CBSA and IRCC inland \noffices, the security screening request is sent via GCMS. \n \n \nThe National Security Screening Division (NSSD) of the CBSA conducts security screening on all \nrefugee claimants over the age of 18 for inadmissibility pursuant to sections A34, A35 and/or A37. \n \nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) screens all refugee protection claimants over \nthe age of 18, pursuant to section 13 of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, for \nindividuals who may pose threats to the security of Canada. \n \nNote: CSIS does not screen applications with respect to a person’s admissibility to Canada. \n \nNote: The RPD will be notified via interface with FOSS that security screening is completed and that the \ncase can proceed to a hearing. \n \nIf no adverse information is discovered, the NSSD will complete the Refugee Monitoring screen \naccordingly, and the RPD can proceed with the hearing. \n \nIf the NSSD collects sufficient adverse information to support inadmissibility pursuant to sections A34, \nA35 and/or A37, the NSSD will contact the relevant hearings office by email to advise that a \nrecommendation is forthcoming. \n \nThe RPD monitors FESS for all claimants and will not proceed to a hearing if FESS has not been \ncompleted. If FESS is not completed six months after the file was referred to the RPD, the RPD will \nschedule a hearing with due notification to the CBSA. \n \n9.6 Potential intervention \n \nIt is at this stage that the hearings officer should consider if an intervention is warranted and whether or \nnot to submit a change date and time (CDT) application to the IRB to postpone the hearing. \n \nVisa office requests \n \nAt the triage centres, all claims undergo a GCMS check to determine if the claimant has applied for or\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n56 \n \n \nreceived status under another application under the IRPA (e.g., a temporary resident visa [TRV]). If a \nTRV was issued by a visa office abroad, the triage centre may print a report containing pertinent \ninformation from the application. \n \nIf the original application is required, the hearings officer should send an email to the visa office specifying \nthe need for a copy of the application. The message must not include any personal information identifying \nthe claimant. It should be formatted as follows: \n \nRequest for IC3 information: TRP V970100012 issued on 02Jan03 \n \nProvide details of temporary resident visa request for subject and forward a copy of the temporary \nresident visa application by fax to (your name and fax number). \n \nAll other information relating to immigration matters should be obtained through the liaison officer at the \nappropriate visa office. Files at visa offices are retained for two years. \n \nNote: All liaison officer related assistance requests must be directed to the International Network \nSection (INS). For urgent matters, the hearings officer may contact a liaison officer directly and copy INS. \n \n9.7 Special cases of verification with foreign authorities \n \nOfficers and investigators must always keep in mind the importance of not disclosing personal information \nto the authorities of the country of nationality or of any other country where there is an allegation of \npersecution or mistreatment. Secure checking mechanisms that do not compromise the safety of the \nclaimant or the claimant’s family must be used, since disclosure of information to the authorities of the \ncountry of nationality may lead to the creation of refugees sur place. \n \nWhen making contact with foreign authorities, it is important not to disclose the fact that the claimant is \napplying for refugee protection in Canada; that the claimant is presently in Canada; the claimant’s name, \naddress, and telephone number; etc., unless the claimant has expressly consented to such disclosure or \nthis information is provided to authorities of a country where there is no allegation of persecution. \n \nWhere possible, officers are urged to ask the claimant to sign a declaration authorizing the disclosure of \npersonal information. Some foreign authorities require such authorization before they will share personal \ninformation. \n \n9.8 Intervention in person \n \nParagraph A170(e) gives the Minister of PSEP the right, without restricting rightful intervention in \nexclusion cases, to present evidence, question witnesses, and make representations in all cases. In \ncases that are identified as requiring the presence of a hearings officer (to represent the Minister of \nPSEP), the hearings officer is not restricted and may present any evidence, reply to any argument, \nquestion witnesses, and make representation deemed to be useful. \n \nHearings officers must serve notice of the intention to intervene by sending a notice of intervention no \nlater than 10 days before the date fixed for the hearing, in accordance with rule 29 of the RPDR and by \ndisclosing the evidence no later than 10 days before the hearing date (rule 29 of the RPDR) or 5 days\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n57 \n \n \nbefore the hearing if responding to a document filed by a party or the RPD (subrule 34(3) of the RPDR). \n \n9.9 Intervention by filing documents and submissions \n \nSection A170 gives the Minister of PSEP the right to present evidence, question witnesses and make \nrepresentations in all cases, without restriction. This right implies that the Minister of PSEP may choose to \npresent evidence and representations in writing by filing documents in accordance with the requirements \nof subrule 29(2) of the RPDR. \n \n9.10 Review of reasons for RPD decisions \n \nOfficers may review the RPD’s written reasons to determine whether or not an appeal to the RAD or an \napplication for leave and judicial review should be requested. In cases where a refugee protection claim \nhas been granted, and written reasons have not been provided, officers must send a request for written \nreasons to the RPD registry within 10 days of receiving the notice of decision (rule 67 of the RPDR). \n \n9.11 Appeal to RAD \n \nThe Minister may appeal RPD decisions to the RAD if there is reason to believe that there was an error in \nlaw, fact, or mixed law and fact. However, pursuant to subsection A110(2), certain decisions may not be \nappealed to the RAD, including decisions of the RPD rejecting the Minister’s application to vacate or \ncease a claim. \n \nRefer to ENF 26 for RAD procedures. \n \n9.12 Application for judicial review \n \nThe Minister of PSEP or the Minister of IRCC, as the case may be, may file an applicaton for leave and \njudicial review of RPD decisions to the Federal Court and to the Federal Court of Appeal under certain \nconditions. \n \nNote: Officers who think that a decision should be the subject of a judicial review must follow the \nprocedure set out in ENF 9, Judicial Review. \n \n9.13 Operational procedures for interventions \n \nIn all ministerial intervention cases, officers must follow the procedures indicated below to ensure \ncomplete follow-up of the case and proper conduct of the intervention. \n \nTable 7: Operational procedures for interventions \n \nStage \nAction \n1.

Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention: Crimes against peace, war crimes, and \ncrimes against humanity \n \nIn order to define crimes under article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention, decision makers should refer to \ninternational instruments as well as other sources. Canadian courts generally rely on the Charter of the \nInternational Military Tribunal, the Statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \nCourt as well as the jurisprudence of the ad hoc tribunals. \n \nWhere a claimant has not personally committed a crime, but has had a role in aiding, instigating, or \ncounselling someone else to commit a war crime or crime against humanity, the claimant may be held \nresponsible as an accomplice and may be excluded from refugee protection. An accomplice is as guilty \nas the person who committed the crime. Canadian courts have defined complicity as \n \n \nbeing present at an international crime if combined with authority (also known as command \nresponsibility/superior orders); \n \nvoluntary, significant, and knowing contribution; and \n \naiding and abetting. \n \n1.1 SCC decision in Ezokola v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 SCC 40 \n \nThe SCC ruling in the matter of Ezokola v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 SCC 40 has \nreformulated the legal test by which to assess complicity in the context of exclusions that were previously \nestablished in Ramirez2 as follows: \n \n \neliminated complicity by association; \n \neliminated the assumption that membership in an organization with a limited, brutal purpose \nmakes an individual complicit in the crime the group is alleged to have committed; and \n \nadded one new factor to the existing list of factors to be considered when assessing complicity \n(see section 1.3 below). \n \nThe SCC proposes that a contribution-based test be used when assessing complicity in the context of \nexclusions pursuant to article 1F of the Refugee Convention. This test requires that there are serious \nreasons for considering that the individual made a voluntary, knowing, and significant contribution to the \ncrime or criminal purpose of the group alleged to have committed the crime. \n \n1.2 Key components of the contribution-based test for complicity \n \n \nVoluntary contribution to the crime or criminal purpose: Decision makers are to consider the \nmethod of recruitment by the organization and any opportunity the claimant has had to \n \n2 Ramirez v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 2 F.C. 306 (C.A.) is the seminal decision \naddressing complicity in the context of exclusion.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n64 \n \n \ndisassociate from the organization. The requirement to show that the contribution was voluntary \ncovers the defense of duress. The contribution to the crime or criminal purpose must be \nvoluntarily made; it cannot be made under duress. \n \nSignificant3 contribution to the group’s crime or criminal purpose: The mere association factor is \nreplaced with a culpable complicity factor when an individual makes a significant contribution to \nthe crime or criminal purpose of a group. The degree of contribution must be carefully assessed \nto prevent an unreasonable extension of criminal participation in international criminal law. \n \nKnowing contribution to the crime or criminal purpose: The individual must be aware of the \ngroup’s crime or criminal purpose and aware that their conduct will assist in the furtherance of the \ncrime or criminal purpose. \n \n1.3 Revised factors to be applied when assessing complicity in the context of exclusions \n \n \nThe size and nature of the organization \n \nThe part of the organization with which the refugee claimant was most directly concerned (looks \nnew, but already applied in practice) \n \nThe refugee claimant’s duties and activities within the organization (new) \n \nThe refugee claimant’s position or rank in the organization \n \nThe length of time the refugee claimant was in the organization, particularly after acquiring \nknowledge of the group’s crime or criminal purpose \n \nThe method by which the refugee claimant was recruited and the refugee claimant’s opportunity \nto leave the organization \n \nNote: The SCC has made it clear that the above factors are not necessarily exhaustive and are not given \nthe same weight in each case. The focus of the assessment must remain on the individual’s contribution \nto the crime or criminal purpose, and any viable defences should be taken into account. The weight of \neach factor will depend on the context of the case at hand. \n \nNote: In applying the new test, the focus must always remain on the individual’s voluntary, significant, \nand knowing contribution to the crime or criminal purpose. \n \n1.4 What does this mean in the context of exclusions? \n \nIn its decision on Ezokola, the SCC eliminated guilt by association, and, as a result, being a member of \nan organization with a limited, brutal purpose no longer leads automatically to exclusion from refugee \nprotection. Decision makers must now establish a nexus between the refugee claimant and the crime or \ncriminal purpose of the group [para. 9, 30] to exclude the claimant from refugee protection. \n \nWhile the new contribution-based test for complicity set out in Ezokola replaces the former personal and \nknowing participation test, it does not replace other potential modes of partial liability for the commission \nof international crimes such as aiding and abetting, inciting, ordering, commanding, or having superior \nresponsibility, etc., as set out in international instruments. \n \n1.5 Relevant case law following Ezokola \n \n \n3 The Court has not defined “significant” in this context, but it should be assessed in the context of each individual \ncase.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n65 \n \n \n1.5.1 Organizations with a limited, brutal purpose \n \nFollowing the SCC decision on Ezokola, individiduals can no longer be excluded from refugee \nprotection simply because they were associated with an organization with a limited, brutal \npurpose. Instead, decision makers have to show that the individual made a significant, voluntary, \nknowing contribution to the crime or criminal purpose of the organization. That is, the claimant’s \nconduct and role within the organization must be carefully established on an individualized basis \nto show that the contribution was voluntarily made and had a significant impact on the crime or \ncriminal purpose of the group. \n \nJurisprudence with respect to the nature of an organization remains relevant, since establishing \nthat an organization has a limited, brutal purpose may assist decision makers in assessing the \nfactors related to the size and nature of the organization. The link between the contribution and \nthe criminal purpose will be easier to establish. \n \nThe following cases remain relevant when assessing complicity using the factors established by \nthe SCC in Ezokola: \n \n \nRutayisire v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 1168, par. 35. \n \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Hajialikhani, [1999] 1 FC 181, \npar. 24. \n \nYogo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCT 90. \n \n1.5.2 Non-brutal organizations \n \nNon-brutal organizations are entities that have a legitimate purpose but have committed war \ncrimes or crimes against humanity outside of their main function. \n \nComplicity in non-brutal organizations must be established on a voluntary, knowing, and \nsignificant contribution to the crime or criminal purpose of the group alleged to have committed \nthe crime. \n \nThe cases below on identifying non-brutal organizations remain relevant in establishing complicity \nfor the purpose of exclusion, as part of the aiding and abetting type of involvement, which should \ntheoretically apply and be captured by the contribution-based test established by the SCC in \nEzokola. \n \nPlease see the following cases as examples of handing over persons as a form of aiding \nand abetting: \n \n \nSulemana v.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCA 178, the court summarized its \nreading of the general purposes of article 1F of the Refugee Convention and article 1F(b) of the Refugee \nConvention in particular as ensuring that the \n \n \nperpetrators of international crimes or acts contrary to certain international standards will be \nunable to claim the right of asylum; \n \nperpetrators of ordinary crimes committed for fundamentally political purposes can find refuge in \na foreign country; \n \nright of asylum is not used by the perpetrators of serious, ordinary crimes in order to escape the \nordinary course of local justice; and \n \ncountry of refuge can protect its own people by closing its borders to criminals whom it regards as \nundesirable because of the seriousness of the ordinary crimes which it suspects such criminals of \nhaving committed. (para.119) \n \nIn Canada for a crime to be considered serious in the context of exclusion under article 1F(b) of the \nRefugee Convention, it must be a capital crime or a very grave, punishable act. \n \nThe notion of what is to be considered a serious crime is to be considered in relation to the criminal law \nsystem of the country of refuge rather than the country of origin. \n \n \nZrig v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCA 178. \n \nLai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FCA 125. \n \nJayasekara v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FCA 404. \n \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Li, 2010 FCA 75. \n \nIn addition to examining the Criminal Code of Canada regarding the seriousness of the crime, it is also \npermissible to canvas international instruments that deal with the subject matter of the crime in question. \n \n \nKovacs v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1473 (child abduction). \n \nJayasekara v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FCA 404. (drug trafficking \nthat makes reference to legislation of other western countries). \n \nNote: Decision makers may consider as evidence the criminal charges and convictions in a foreign \ncountry; however, they should be cautious when doing so [Biro v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2007 FC 776 and Arevalo Pineda v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 \nFC 454]. \n \n2.1 Federal Court of Appeal decision in Jayasekara \n \nThere is a strong tendency to consider any crime, the equivalent of which carries a maximum penalty of \nat least ten years in Canadian criminal law as a serious crime, even though the actual sentence imposed \nin the country in which the crime was committed may be considerably less than the maximum penalty,\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n68 \n \n \nhad the crime been committed in Canada, the application of the methodology adopted in Jayasekara v. \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC238/2008 FCA 404 may rebut this \npresumption. \n \nIn Jayasekara, the Federal Court of Appeal established that in interpreting article 1F(b) of the Refugee \nConvention with respect to seriousness of a crime, an evaluation of the following factors should be \nconsidered: \n \n \nthe elements of the crime; \n \nthe mode of prosecution; \n \nthe penalty prescribed; \n \nthe facts; and \n \nthe mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction. \n \nSince 2010, the Federal Court has dealt mostly with the application of of the methodology adopted by the \nFederal Court of Appeal in Jayasekara. \n \nNote: In Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC, the SCC provided the following \ncomments: “The Federal Court of Appeal in Chan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), \n[2000] 4 F.C. 390 (C.A.) and Jayasekara has taken the view that where a maximum sentence of ten years \nor more could have been imposed, had the crime been committed in Canada, the crime will generally be \nconsidered serious. I agree. However, this generalization should not be understood as a rigid \npresumption that is impossible to rebut. Where a provision of the Canadian Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, \nc. C-46, has a large sentencing range, the upper end being ten years or more and the lower end being \nquite low, a claimant whose crime would fall at the less serious end of the range in Canada should not be \npresumptively excluded. Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention is designed to exclude only those \nwhose crimes are serious. The UNHCR has suggested that a presumption of serious crime might be \nraised by evidence of commission of any of the following offences: homicide, rape, child molesting, \nwounding, arson, drugs trafficking, and armed robbery (G. S. Goodwin-Gill, The Refugee in International \nLaw (3rd ed. 2007), at p. 179). These are good examples of crimes that are sufficiently serious to \npresumptively warrant exclusion from refugee protection. However, as indicated, the presumption may be \nrebutted in a particular case. While consideration of whether a maximum sentence of ten years or more \ncould have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada is a useful guideline, and crimes \nattracting a maximum sentence of ten years or more in Canada will generally be sufficiently serious to \nwarrant exclusion; the ten-year rule should not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust \nmanner.” \n \n2.2 Mode of prosecution \n \nThe Federal Court has held that the mode of prosecution relates to the choice made by a foreign \nprosecutor in deciding to proceed in the case of hybrid offences, with the more serious offence(s) in \nquestion by way of indictment or with the less serious offence(s) by laying a charge using a summary or \nmisdemeanour offence with the implication that going ahead with the less serious charge is a factor in \nfavour of the asylum seeker. The cases below dealt with minor sexual offences in the U.S., resulting in \nthe persons not being excluded in Canada, as these offences did not meet the threshold of serious \ncriminality. \n \n \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Lopez Velasco, 2011 FC 627.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n69 \n \n \n \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Ammar, 2011 FC 1094. \n \nVucaj v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 381. \n \nFor an example where exclusion was upheld, refer to \n \n \nHernandez Gomez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 271. (weapons \noffences in the U.S.) \n \nOn the other hand, if an offence is committed outside of Canada, but the behaviour amounts to a hybrid \noffence in Canada of which the summary variation has a maximum penalty much higher than other \nsummary offences in Canada, such as the offence of sexual interference, a person can be excluded \npursuant to article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. \n \n \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Raina, 2012 FC 618. \n \n2.3 Penalty prescribed \n \nDecision makers should not take into account the cumulative effect of the penalties that could be \nimposed for all of the offences committed by a person. \n \n \nVucaj v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 381. \n \nMaximum penalties that can be imposed for the commission of an offence with a mandatory minimum \nsentence should not be taken into consideration in the assessment of what constitutes a serious crime. \n \n \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Nwobi, 2014 FC 520. \n \n2.4 Aggravating and mitigating circumstances (including rehabilitation) \n \nThe aggravating and mitigating circumstances go to the nature of the crime committed, not what might be \nlater considered as factors to be taken into account in determining whether the offender has been \nrehabilitated. \n \n \nRojas Camacho v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 789. \n \nNote: It is important for the decision maker to actually consider these contextual factors in a meaningful \nway and reflect how the competing factors have been assessed and weighed in determining if a crime \nwas serious for the purpose of exclusion pursuant to article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. It is not \nenough for the decision maker to simply list the factors and then state a conclusion. \n \n \nAguilar v.

(drug trafficking in \nGermany and killing in Nigeria) \n \n2.4.1 Mitigating factors \n \nA constraint short of duress may be a relevant mitigating factor in assessing the seriousness of \nthe crime committed. \n \n \nJayasekara v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), para.45. \n \nHowever, a full defence such as duress goes beyond being a mitigating factor and negates \nliability under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. \n \n \nGuerra Diaz v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2013 FC. \n \nThe claimant’s admission of guilt, a favourable plea bargain and a troubled childhood may be \nrelevant mitigating factors. \n \n \nGudima v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 382. \n \nThe claimant’s age and lack of previous convictions, the limited amount of drugs, and the fact that \nthe substance contained methamphetamine as opposed to pure methamphetamine along with the \nclaimant’s refugee status and life in a marginalized neighbourhood may be relevant mitigating \nfactors. \n \n \nShire v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 97. \n \nThe claimant’s addiction to painkillers, resulting from an injury sustained during a criminal gang \nfight, the claimant’s cooperation with authorities, their role as an instrumental key witness for the \nCrown, the lack of weapons involved in the drug trafficking offence, and the absence of serious \ninjury resulting from the offence may be relevant mitigating factors. \n \n \nVucaj v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 381. \n \nMitigating circumstances are only relevant if they directly relate to the commission of the offence \nat that time and not to issues related to the character of the refugee claimant after the \ncommission of the offence. To this end, the seriousness of a crime is to be assessed at the time \nthe crime was committed. \n \nRehabilitation and current lack of dangerousness are irrelevant considerations in determining if a \nperson should be excluded under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention and do not need to be \ntaken into account. In other words, the seriousness of the crime is not to be balanced against \nfactors that are extraneous to the commission of the offence, such as current dangerousness, \nexpiation, or rehabilitation. Only factors related to the commission of the criminal offences can be \nconsidered.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n71 \n \n \n \nFebles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68. \n \nNote: Rehabilitation is not taken into account and is not balanced against the presumed \nseriousness of the crime arising from the fact that, if committed in Cananda, the crime is \npunishable by at least ten years imprisonment. \n \n \nRojas Camacho v.

Canada (Minister of \nCitizenship and Immigration) 2014 FCA 157.) \n \nWhen assessing seriousness of a crime in the context of exclusions under article 1F(b) of the \nRefugee Convention, the fact that the person is not a danger to the security of Canada after \narrival is also not to be taken into account. \n \n \nHernandez Febles v.

Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (C.A.), [1995] 1 F.C. 508, the Federal Court of \nAppeal held that, for a crime to be characterized as political and, therefore, to fall outside the scope of \narticle 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention, it must meet a two-pronged incidence test as follows: \n \n1. the existence of a political disturbance related to a struggle to modify or abolish either a \ngovernment or a government policy; and \n2. a rational nexus between the crime committed and the potential accomplishment of the political \nobjective sought. \n \nThe Court of Appeal considered and rejected the notion of balancing the seriousness of the persecution \nthe claimant is likely to suffer against the gravity of the crime they committed.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n76 \n \n \nIn Gil, the court upheld a tribunal decision to exclude an individual who had been involved five or six times \nin placing Molotov cocktails in crowded business premises owned by wealthy supporters of the Khomeini \ngovernment in Iran and by members of local revolutionary committees. \n \nThe court noted that violent acts committed randomly for political purposes may not be regarded as \npolitical acts, due to the lack of a causal connection between the crime committed and the alleged \npolitical end. The court also stressed that violent acts committed against unarmed civilians, which \ninevitably result in the death or serious injury of civilians, are completely disproportionate to the legitimate \npolitical objective sought, regardless of what that is. \n \nThe court states that, while the political offence exception occurs in both extradition and refugee law, \nthere are substantial differences between the two systems, as a result of which these considerations \n“would seem to point to a need for even greater caution in characterizing a crime as political for the \npurposes of applying article 1F(b) [of the Refugee Convention] than for the purpose of denying \nextradition” (Gil v. Canada). \n \nAfter considering in detail the extradition law of other countries, the court decided that the incidence test \nfrom extradition law was also the most appropriate to assess the political offence exception in refugee \nlaw. In applying this test to the facts of the case, the court was of the opinion that there was no objective \nrational connection between injuring the commercial interests of certain wealthy supporters of the regime \nand any realistic goal of forcing the regime itself to fall or change its ways or politics. This nexus was too \ntenuous to justify the kind of indiscriminate violence the refugee claimant admitted to (Gil v. Canada). \n \nIn Durango v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1081, the court found that the \npolitical offence exception did not apply in this case because the crime was not committed in Colombia, \nwhere the political activities took place, but in the country of refuge. In addition, there was no evidence \nthat the person actually had engaged in political activities when returning to Colombia with a false \npassport that had been obtained in the U.S. \n \nA.C. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1500 involved the killing of the \npresident of Bangladesh in the early seventies as part of an attempt to overthrow the government and \nalso the killing of his family and entourage. The political defence exemption was found to be not \napplicable, but it is not clear whether this decision was based on only the lack of proportionality or also \nthe lack of nexus (see also A. Kaushal and C. Dauvergne4). \n \nOther cases where the claimant was unable to convince a court that their criminal activities fit the political \noffence exception, primarily by already failing this first part of the test, which was said not to apply, \ninclude the following: \n \n \nGregorio v.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 1147, the Federal Court \nupheld the RPD’s decision to exclude a refugee claimant under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention, \neven though he had completed his sentence for the crime in question (paras. 54 and 58).

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 97. \n \nIn Jaysekara, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed that if the length or completion of a sentence is \nconsidered in the context of exclusion under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention, it should not be \nconsidered in isolation for the following reasons: \n \n \nThere are a number of reasons why a lenient sentence may actually be imposed in the country \nwhere the crime was committed, even for a serious crime. The sentence, however, would not \ndiminish the seriousness of the crime committed. \n \nOn the other hand, in some countries, a person may be subjected to substantial prison terms for \nbehaviour that is not considered criminal in Canada (para. 41, Jaysekara FCA 404.). \n \n2.9 Complicity \n \nNote: The legal test established by the SCC in Ezokola also applies to establishing complicity pursuant to \nexclusions under article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. \n \n3 Article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention – Acts contrary to the purposes and \nprinciples of the United Nations \n \nArticle 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention only applies to acts that amount to sustained, systematic, and \nserious violations of human rights or acts of terrorism, forced disappearance, torture, hostage taking, and \napartheid.

This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of \nthe country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are \nattached to the possession of the nationality of that country.” \n \nThe purpose of article 1E of the Refugee Convention is to exclude persons who do not require the \nprotection of refugee status. Therefore, it supports the purposes of the IRPA by limiting refugee claims to \nthose who clearly face the threat of persecution. \n \n \nKroon v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1995), Imm. L.R. (2d) 164 (F.C.T.D.) \nat 167-168. \n \nThe rationale for the enactment of article 1E of the Refugee Convention in 1951 was to exclude refugees \nand expellees of German ethnic origin in the Federal Republic of Germany, who, by virtue of article 116 of \nthe Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, were treated as German nationals. The reason for \nexcluding these persons was that the signatories to the Convention considered they should be the \nresponsibility of Germany. \n \n \nAtle Grahl-Madsen, The Status of Refugees in International Law, Vol. 1, Sijthoff-Leyden, 1966, \npp. 267–270. \n \nJames C.

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), (FCTD, A-1424-92, October 20, 1993), the judge \nmerely stated that the exclusion clause under article E of the Refugee Convention did not apply to the \nclaimant, who had lost the citizenship of the USSR when he emigrated to Israel but had the right to \nreapply for citizenship of the Ukraine, although it was not clear if he was able to return. \n \nIn Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Mahdi, Roon Abdikarim (F.C.A., no. A-632-94), \n(supra), the Federal Court, Trial Division, overruled the CRDD decision excluding a person from Somalia \nwho was in possession of a U.S. residency card, based on exclusion on the ground set out in article 1E of \nthe Refugee Convention, because the CRDD, while stating that the claimant had most of the rights \nenjoyed by citizens, did not inquire whether the right to return was extinguished by the fact that she had \ngiven up her residency in the U.S. The case is presently under appeal as the result of certification.\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n82 \n \n \nIn Kroon v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (F.C.T.D., no. IMM-3161-93) (supra), the \nCRDD decision excluding a person who was a national of Russia but had residency in Estonia was \nupheld. The judge indicated that exclusion under article 1E of the Refugee Convention should be not be \nconfined to those cases where applicants have moved from their own country of nationality to seek \nrefugee status in another country, where they then reside with essentially similar rights to those of \nnationals of the second country. \n \nThe court found that, in this case, the person would have a status comparable to that of Estonian \nnationals and consistent with international conventions and treaties relating to rights and obligations of \nindividuals. It also held that the person could be expected to be restored to his rights of residency in \nEstonia as a registered non-citizen and that, upon his return within a reasonable time, he would be \nentitled to apply for citizenship and, in the meantime, had a right to remain there with rights similar to \nmost enjoyed by citizens. \n \nIn Shamlou (supra), the CRDD decision to exclude a person from Iran who had permanent resident status \nin Mexico and who had been convicted of attempted sexual battery in the U.S. after a guilty plea, based \non articles 1E and 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention, was upheld by the court. In agreeing with the CRDD \non the exclusion under article 1E of the Refugee Convention, the judge relied on Hathaway (supra), \nWaldman (Lorne Waldman, Immigration Law and Practice, vol. 1, Toronto: Butterworths Canada Ltd., \n1992), and the UNHCR Handbook for the parameters of article E of the Refugee Convention and referred \nto the Olschewski (supra), Kroon (supra), Hurt (supra), and Mahdi (supra) cases regarding the rights and \nobligations for nationals. The court accepted Waldman's criteria for this exclusion clause as the rights to \nreturn, to work freely without restrictions, to study, and to full access to social services in the country of \nresidence. With respect to the assertion that the claimant had lost his permanent resident status as the \nresult of the operation of Mexican law, the decision indicated that, since there was no conclusive \nevidence to that effect, it was not unreasonable for the CRDD to exclude the person. \n \nThe Mahdi (supra) case was decided as a result of certification of a judgment of the Federal Court, Trial \nDivision, which had overturned a CRDD decision excluding a Somalian person who had been granted \npermanent resident status in the U.S. and who had returned to Somalia and had then come to Canada in \norder to claim refugee status. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Trial Division judge \nprimarily as a result of the peculiar factual situation. The court indicated that this was not a case where a \nperson had voluntarily renounced the protection of one country in order to seek refuge elsewhere. The \nevidence did not show that the person had left the U.S. for Somalia with the intention of coming to \nCanada. In these circumstances, the person was not precluded from claiming refugee status in Canada, \nas she still had good reasons to fear persecution in Somalia. \n \nWith respect to the question of whether the person was still recognized as a permanent resident by the \ncompetent authorities of the U.S., the court held that the evidence that showed that there was a possibility \nthat U.S. authorities would no longer recognize her as a permanent resident and would, therefore, deny \nher the right to return should be taken into account in deciding if it would be established, on a balance of \nprobabilities, that the U.S. authorities still recognized her as a permanent resident. \n \nIn Hadissi (supra), the CRDD decision excluding a person who was a permanent resident of the U.S. and \nwho had come to Canada to claim refugee status, based on article 1E of the Refugee Convention, was \nupheld by the court. Hadissi argued that she had abandoned her permanent resident status and that she \nhad no right to entry to the U.S. The court decided that there was no evidence that she had lost her status \nin the U.S. Based on Mahdi (supra) (both the Federal Court, Trial Division, and the Federal Court of\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n83 \n \n \nAppeal), the court found that the CRDD had not made a reviewable error based on the evidence before it \nin which more weight was given to the Minister's evidence than to the hearsay evidence of the applicant. \n \nIn Wassiq (supra), the CRDD decision to exclude a person from Afghanistan who had obtained refugee \nstatus in Germany, but whose travel documents from Germany had expired, was overturned. As a result \nof the expired travel documents and the inability under German law to renew them, the person’s \nresidency permit had also expired. The finding of the CRDD that Germany should have assumed \nresponsibility was not sufficient for the application of exclusion under article 1E of the Refugee \nConvention if, in fact, Germany did not allow the person to return. \n \nIn Hassanzadeh (supra), the decision whereby a person who was living in Austria, where he was allowed \nto work and return, was excluded on the basis of exclusion on the ground set out in article 1E of the \nRefugee Convention was upheld by the court. The argument used by the applicant that, in order to \ncontinue to be able to work in Austria, he was required to have a valid passport from his home country \nwas rejected, as there was no evidence of that assertion, and the onus was on the applicant to prove his \nstatement. Mahdi (supra) does not apply in these circumstances. \n \nIn Kanesharan (supra), the CRDD decision excluding a person who had temporary status in the U.K., \nbased on exclusion under article 1E of the Refugee Convention, was overturned by the Federal Court, \nTrial Division. The court found that a person such as the applicant, who had temporary status in the U.K. \nbut was in a situation where the Home Office reserved the right to remove him to his country of nationality \nshould prevailing circumstances change significantly in a positive manner, was eligible to remain after \nhaving been on exceptional leave for four years and on renewal for three years, and had the right to make \ntrips to and from the U.K., does not have the rights envisaged by exclusion under article 1E of the \nRefugee Convention. \n \nHamdan (supra) resulted in a CRDD decision excluding a person who, in the Philippines, had the rights to \nreturn to that country and to study and who received a stipend from the UNHCR (as a result, the right to \nwork was not material in this case). The right to social services was not clear on the evidence based on \nexclusion under article 1E of the Refugee Convention. The CRDD decision was overruled by the court on \nthe basis that it was not necessary to determine whether the above criteria (from Shamlou, supra) were \nfulfilled. What had to be determined was whether the person had all rights and obligations of citizens in \nthe country of residence, which can change depending on the country of residence. In this case, \naccording to the court, it would appear critical that the applicant had neither the right to work nor the right \nto receive social services. The court also found that the CRDD had applied the wrong standard, namely \nwhether the Philippines was a safe haven and not whether the applicant had the rights and obligations of \ncitizens. \n \nIn Mohamed (supra), the court upheld the CRDD decision excluding a person on the ground set out in \narticle 1E of the Refugee Convention to a person who originated from Somalia and who had permanent \nresident status in Sweden until April 12, 1997. The evidence indicated that permanent residents in \nSweden have the same rights as permanent residents in Canada, that the certificate of permanent \nresidency is automatically renewed if the person is still in Sweden, and that, if the person abandons \nSweden as their place of residency, their status lapses on the date that the certificate is up for renewal. \nThe court dismissed the application from the bench so that the applicants could return to Sweden in time \nto renew their certificate. The court indicated that, although the applicants arrived in Canada with no \nstatus (they were still waiting on their application for refugee status, which was rejected, but instead \nbecame permanent residents after arriving in Canada), the critical time for the question of their status was\nENF 24 Ministerial interventions \n2016-03-18 \n84 \n \n \nat the CRDD hearing, at which time the applicants had permanent resident status in Sweden. The court \nalso raised the concern of asylum shopping, where a person voluntarily abandons a legal status in a \ncountry that has provided protection and goes to another country. This is not what the Refugee \nConvention intends. \n \nIn Shahpari (supra), the Federal Court, Trial Division, upheld a CRDD decision involving exclusion under \narticle 1E of the Refugee Convention, where a person from Iran was given a carte de résident in France \nin 1991, valid for ten years, came to Canada in 1994 after first obtaining a French exit/re-entry visa, and, \nupon arriving in Canada, destroyed this visa. The court held that, in cases of exclusion under article E of \nthe Refugee Convention, the onus is on the government, but the onus shifts to the applicant to show why \nthe clause should not apply in circumstances where the government has put forward a prima facie case \nthat the exclusion clause applies. Expiration of the visa, the impossibility to renew it outside of France, \nand the destruction thereof are not sufficient reasons to discharge the shifted onus on the applicant. The \ncourt also indicated that exclusion under article 1E of the Refugee Convention will be given broad \napplication against claimants who are engaged in asylum shopping. \n \nIn Agha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (IMM-4282-99, January 12, 2001, Nadon J.), \nthe court concluded that the IRB did consider the factual situation regarding the possibility of the applicant \nreturning to the U.S., as his permanent residence status was still active. In doing so, the court departed \nfrom the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Mahdi and followed Jerome J.'s decision in Hadissi. The \ncourt also confirmed the principle stated in Shahpari (Rothstein J.), i.e., once the Minister submits \nevidence to the effect that an applicant can return to a given country, the onus shifts to the applicant to \nshow that they cannot. The judicial review was dismissed.

The IRCC pilot project has been established as a result \nof the coming into force of the amended IRPA and will be in place until 2015. IRCC senior immigration \nofficers are located in satellite offices in Vancouver, Montréal, and the main R&I office in Toronto. \n \nThe Minister of PSEP will intervene in cases involving credibility, program integrity issues, and exclusion \nunder article 1E of the Refugee Convention only in the following circumstances: \n \n \nhybrid cases (combined security or serious criminality and credibility/program integrity issues); \n \ndetained cases; \n \nconstitutional challenges; \n \nmass arrival cases; and \n \npeople smuggling/human trafficking cases. \n \nHowever, if a hybrid case is referred to CBSA Hearings and results in a determination that no intervention \nis warranted under article 1F of the Refugee Convention, CBSA Hearings will maintain carriage of the file \nand may intervene solely on program integrity or credibility grounds. \n \nConsiderations \n \nThe Minister is bound by the new RPDR, and hearings officers should familiarize themselves with the \nRPDR and follow them accordingly. \n \nThis national directive is effective immediately, and ENF 24 has been updated accordingly."
