In each instrument, \nIRCC and the CBSA designate and delegate authorities to their own officers, as well as to \nofficers in other departments. Therefore, it is important to read both documents to know all \nauthorities linked to a position under IRPA. \nAny person in a prescribed position and making decisions under a designated or delegated \nauthority must successfully complete all official prerequisite CBSA training required for \nthose positions before exercising their designated or delegated authority. \nThese instruments can be found in manual IL 3, Designation of Officers and Delegation of \nAuthority. \n4.1 Powers and authorities of an officer \nThe following sections provide authority for an officer relating to the examination of persons \nseeking to enter Canada: \nPowers of an officer under IRPA and IRPR \nRelevant \nprovisions \nAuthority to conduct an examination where a person makes an application. \nR28 specifies that every person who seeks to enter Canada is making an \napplication and is, therefore, subject to an examination. \nA15(1)\n20 \n \nAuthority to: \n \nboard and inspect any means of transportation bringing persons to \nCanada; \n \nexamine any person carried by that means of transportation and \nany record or document respecting that person; \n \nseize and remove any record or document to obtain copies or \nextracts; and  \n \nhold the means of transportation until the inspection and \nexamination are completed. \nThis section provides authority for officers to commence an examination \nprior to the passenger’s arrival at the Primary Inspection Line (PIL). \nA15(3)  \nAuthority to require a person being examined to produce a visa and all \nrelevant evidence that the officer reasonably requires, including, in the \ncase of FNs, photographic and fingerprint evidence. \nAuthority to request that the FN undergo a medical examination. \nA16(1) and \n(2) \nAuthority to require that a person who makes an application appear for an \nexamination. \nA16(1.1) \nAuthority to require that a FN who makes an application appear for an \ninterview conducted by CSIS. \nA16(2.1) \nAuthority to require or obtain from a PR or FN who is arrested, detained, \nsubject to an examination or subject to a removal order, any evidence — \nphotographic, fingerprint or otherwise — that may be used to establish \ntheir identity or compliance with this Act. \nA16(3) \nAuthority to authorize a person to enter Canada for the purpose of further \nexamination or an admissibility hearing at a later time or date. \nA23 \nAuthority to issue a TRP, if justified by the circumstances, to a foreign \nnational who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of the \nAct, and to cancel the TRP at any time. \nA24 \nAuthority to prepare a report on PRs and FNs who are believed to be \ninadmissible. \nA44(1)  \nAuthority to impose conditions, including the payment of a deposit or the \nposting of a guarantee for compliance with any conditions considered \nnecessary, on a PR or FN who is the subject of a report. \nA44(3)  \nAuthority to authorize a FN against whom a removal order has been \nenforced to return to Canada. \nA52(1)  \nAuthority to issue a warrant for the arrest and detention of a PR or FN who \nthe officer has reasonable grounds to believe is inadmissible and: \n \nis a danger to the public or  \n \nis unlikely to appear for \n \nexamination,  \n \nan admissibility hearing or  \n \nremoval from Canada or \n \na proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal \norder by the Minister under A44(2) \nA55(1)\n21 \n \nAuthority to arrest and detain, without a warrant, a foreign national, other \nthan a protected person: \n \nwho the officer has reasonable grounds to believe is inadmissible \nand is a danger to the public or is unlikely to appear for \nexamination, an admissibility hearing, removal from Canada, or at \na proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by \nthe Minister under A44(2); or \n \nif the officer is not satisfied with the identity of the FN in the course \nof any procedure under the Act. \nA55(2)  \nAuthority to detain a PR or FN on entry to Canada if the officer considers it \nnecessary to do so in order to: \n \ncomplete an examination or  \n \nhas reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is inadmissible \nunder A34, 35, 36, or 37. \nA55(3)  \nAuthority to order the release from detention of a PR or a FN before the \nfirst detention review by the ID if the officer is of the opinion that the \nreasons for the detention no longer exist.

Code, where the \ndefinition of “peace officer” includes the term officer described at \nCA2. The term “Officer” is defined for the purposes of the \nCustoms Act as a person employed in the administration or \nenforcement of this Act, the Customs Tariff or the Special Import \nMeasures Act and includes any member of the Royal Canadian \nMounted Police (RCMP).  \nSection CA2  \nLists the particular sections of the Customs Act that, if violated, \nare punishable by either indictment or summary conviction; \nofficers, therefore, may arrest for contraventions of those \nsections listed. \nSection CA160 \nAuthorizes designated officers, when at a customs office and \nperforming their normal duties, to make an arrest for a criminal \noffence under any other Act of Parliament. \nSubsection CA163.5(1)  \n4.2 Designation of officers \nA6(1) authorizes the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and \nthe Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to designate officers or classes of \nofficers to carry out any purpose or provision of the Act. A designation is made, in most \ncases, where the word “officer” is referred to in the Act or Regulations with respect to a \npower, duty, requirement, or authority. \n4.3 Ministerial delegations \nA6(2) authorizes the Minister of IRCC and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness to delegate powers to other persons. A delegation is made, in most cases, \nwhere the word “minister” is referred to in the Act or Regulations with respect to a power, \nduty, requirement, or authority. Certain ministerial powers, referred to in A6(3), may not be \ndelegated. \n4.4 Designations of Ports of Entry (POE)s \nThe Minister has authority under R26 to designate a place as a POE. The purpose in \ndesignating a POE is to ensure that persons seeking to enter Canada are aware of where \nthey are required to report for examination. \nSee a list of POEs with detailed information, including the types of services and hours of \noperation.\n24 \n \n5 Departmental policy \n5.1 Examinations \nA15(1) authorizes an officer to examine any person making an application in accordance \nwith the Act. This manual deals only with the examination of persons seeking to enter \nCanada. \nR28 stipulates that a person makes an application by: \n \nsubmitting an application in writing; \n \nseeking to enter Canada; \n \nseeking to transit through Canada in airports as provided for by R35; or \n \nmaking a claim for refugee protection. \n5.2 Persons to be examined \nA18(1) provides that every person who seeks to enter Canada, whether they intend to or \nnot, must appear for an examination.  \nA18(2) provides that this also applies to persons who, without leaving Canada, seek to \nleave an area at an airport that is reserved for passengers who are in transit or who are \nwaiting to depart Canada. \n5.3 Primary and secondary examinations \nEvery person seeking to enter Canada must appear for an examination to determine \nwhether they have a right to enter Canada or may become authorized to enter and remain \nin Canada. The examination process at a POE may include a primary and a secondary \nexamination. Primary examinations are completed by a BSO at the PIL. In some airports, \ntravellers will use a Primary Inspection Kiosk (PIK) to verify their travel documents, confirm \ntheir identity and complete an on-screen declaration. In some remote ports, an RCMP officer \nmay complete the primary examination. Immigration Secondary examinations are \nconducted by a BSO at Immigration Secondary following a referral from a BSO at the PIL or \nfrom the PIK. This manual refers to both primary and secondary examinations at a POE. \n5.4 Ministerial Instructions \nA15(4) provides that an officer will conduct an examination in accordance with any \ninstructions that the Minister of IRCC or the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness may give. The authority for the Ministers to give instructions to officers can be \nused to ensure consistency in the application of the Act with respect to examinations. \nMinisterial instructions are not regulations (see A93) but are nevertheless binding on \nofficers.\n25 \n \n5.5 Duties and conduct of the Border Services Officer (BSO) \nA BSO must deal with each person being examined in a courteous, professional and efficient \nmanner. If it is determined that the person has a right of entry under A19, the BSO must \nnot delay their entry into Canada.     \nA FN who is determined: \n \nto be admissible, should be authorized into Canada as a temporary resident \nwith minimal delay; and \n \nto be inadmissible, should be counselled accordingly and the BSO should \nconsider all options afforded by the IRPA and IRPR prior to making a decision. \nA BSO should carefully examine all the facts before making a decision and, where \nappropriate, explain the reasons for that decision to the traveller. \n5.6 End of examination \nR37 provides that the examination of a person seeking to enter or transit through Canada is \nnot final until one of the following outcomes takes place: \nOutcome \nExplanation \nA final determination is made that \nthe person has a right to enter \nCanada or is authorized to enter \nCanada and the person leaves the \nport of entry. \nThe Regulations provide that an examination is not \nfinal until the person has left the controlled area of \nthe POE or, if no controlled area exists, has left the \nPOE. \nFor example, an examination may be continued if, \nduring a Customs Secondary examination, evidence \narises that indicates the person may be \ninadmissible to Canada. If the person’s passport \nhas been stamped or even if the person has been \ngranted PR status, these decisions are not final and \nmay be revisited as long as the person has not left \nthe controlled area of the POE. \nA person in transit departs from \nCanada. \nCertain passengers in transit through Canada are \nnot required to appear for examination if they \nremain in a controlled area pending their onward \nflight out of Canada. They are, nevertheless, \nsubject to examination. If they seek to leave, for \nany reason, the area at an airport that is reserved \nfor passengers who are in transit or who are \nwaiting to depart Canada, they must report for \nexamination [A18(2)]. \nThe person is allowed to leave \nCanada, and their departure is \nconfirmed. \nA BSO may determine a person to be inadmissible \nand allow them to leave Canada pursuant to R42 if \nno report referred to in A44(1) is prepared or \ntransmitted. The examination concludes once their \ndeparture is verified. If, for any reason, the person \ndoes not depart, the examination resumes.\n26 \n \nEntry is authorized by the Minister \nand the person leaves the port of \nentry.  \nThe Minister’s delegate, in reviewing a report \npursuant to A44(1), continues the examination of \nthe person seeking entry. If the Minister’s delegate \ndetermines the report is not founded, the person \nwill be allowed to enter Canada, and the \nexamination will conclude when the person leaves \nthe POE. \nA removal order is issued by the \nMinister and the person leaves the \nport of entry.  \nThe Minister’s delegate, after reviewing a report \npursuant to A44(2), may issue a removal order. \nThe examination ends when the person leaves the \nPOE. \nThe Minister refers the case to the \nID for an admissibility hearing and \nthe person leaves the port of entry.  \nThe Minister’s delegate, after reviewing a report \npursuant to A44(2), may determine that the report \nis well founded and refer it to the ID of the \nImmigration and Refugee Board (IRB) for an \nadmissibility hearing. The examination ends when \nthe person leaves the POE. \nFor refugee claims made at a POE, \nthe examination ends when the \nlater of the following occurs: \n \nthe officer determines that \ntheir claim is ineligible under \nA101 or the Refugee \nProtection Division (RPD) \naccepts or rejects their claim \nunder A107, or \n \na decision in respect of the \nperson is made under \nA44(2) and the person \nleaves the POE. \nThe point at which examination ends is different \nwhere the person is a refugee claimant as the \napplication exists up until the claim has been \ndecided. \nR37(2) provides delegated officers the authority to \nexamine a refugee claimant until a decision is made \nin regards to the claim. \nFor more details, please consult section 11.6 of ENF \n5, Writing 44(1) Reports.  \nA23 allows an officer to authorize a person to enter Canada for the purpose of further \nexamination or an admissibility hearing.  \nFor more information on pre-removal risk assessments, see IRCC’s Program Delivery \nInstructions. \nFor more information on removals, see ENF 10, Removals. \n6 Definitions \nBorder services officer \n(BSO) \nA person designated as an officer by the Minister, \nemployed by the CBSA [A6(1)] [R2] \nCanadian citizen (CC) \nA citizen referred to in subsection 3(1) of the Citizenship \nAct \nCommon-law partner \nIn relation to a person, an individual who is cohabiting with \nthe person in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited \nfor a period of at least one year [R1(1)]\n27 \n \nConvention refugee \nA person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of \npersecution based on race, religion, nationality, \nmembership in a particular social group or political opinion, \n(a) is outside of their country of nationality and is unable \nor, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of \nthe protection of that country; or \n(b) does not have a country of nationality, is outside the \ncountry of their former habitual residence and is unable or, \nby reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country \n[A96] \nForeign national \nA person who is not a Canadian citizen or a PR; includes a \nstateless person [A2(1)] \nGCMS \nGlobal Case Management System: IRCC/CBSA client \nimmigration database \nOfficer \nA person designated as an officer by the Minister under \nA6(1) [R2] \nPermanent resident (PR) \nA person who has acquired permanent residence status and \nhas not subsequently lost that status under A46 [A2(1)] \nProtected person (PP) \nA person on whom refugee protection is conferred and \nwhose claim or application has not subsequently been \ndeemed to be rejected because of cessation or vacation \nproceedings [A95(2)] \nSterile transit area \nAn area in an airport where in-transit passengers, in-transit \npre-clearance passengers or goods that are in transit or \npre-controlled are physically separated from other \npassengers and goods [R2] \n7 Primary Inspection Line (PIL) examinations \nThe examination process usually commences upon the arrival of a person at a POE. This \nmay be a land border, an airport, a marine harbour or any other place designated as a POE. \nBSOs at the PIL are delegated the authority to conduct the initial immigration examination \nof persons seeking entry into Canada. BSOs at the PIL administer legislation and programs \nby providing a wide range of inspection, examination and enforcement activities on behalf of \nmany government departments and agencies. \n7.1 Memorandum of Understanding with Immigration, Refugees and \nCitizenship Canada (IRCC) \nOn December 12, 2003, the CBSA was created, and immigration enforcement and \nintelligence responsibilities under IRPA were transferred to this new agency from IRCC. \nThe purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to define, in general terms, the \nbasis for cooperation between IRCC and the CBSA regarding: \n \nthe delivery of the immigration program; \n \ninformation sharing; and \n \nthe provision of various services.\n28 \n \nFor more information on the roles and responsibilities of the CBSA and IRCC, see the full \ntext of the MOU. \n7.2 Immigration secondary referral list \nParagraph 59 of part 2, chapter 1 of The People Processing Manual provides the \nImmigration Secondary Referral List which contains the categories of persons who are \nmandatory referrals for an Immigration examination, such as: \n \ninadmissible persons under sections 34 to 42 of the IRPA; \n \npersons whose citizenship or status is doubtful; \n \nFNs refusing to answer questions; \n \nFNs refused entry into another country; \n \npersons whose documents, such as passport, seems doubtful; \n \nimmigration Lookouts; \n \nCanadian citizens in possession of an emergency passport issued abroad; \n \nPRs of Canada who have had extended absences from Canada; \n \nFNs intending to stay longer than six (6) months; \n \nFNs seeking medical treatment or appear ill; \n \nForeign workers and students on first entry. \nBSOs at the PIL may also refer anyone else who they believe should be examined in more \ndetail.  \nExamples of types of referrals that should be sent to Immigration Secondary include cases \nwhere the BSO at the PIL: \n \nhas doubts about the person’s identity; \n \nsuspects the FN may have a criminal record; \n \nbelieves the FN may require documentation such as a WP or SP; \n \nhas concerns about the length of time the FN is requesting to stay in Canada in light \nof their actual travel plans. \n7.3 Liaison with officers at the PIL \nBSOs at the PIL are encouraged to inquire about the results of their referrals to Immigration \nSecondary. BSOs at Immigration Secondary do not operate under the same time constraints \nas BSOs at the PIL and have more time to conduct immigration examinations effectively. \nBSOs at Immigration Secondary should, whenever possible, provide feedback on the results \nof referrals. Liaising between officers is a key element in developing and maintaining an \neffective and positive working relationship with officers who conduct the primary portion of \nthe examination process. In addition, discussing cases allows BSOs at Immigration \nSecondary to give guidance to BSOs at the PIL regarding immigration requirements. This \nincreases the quality of referrals from the PIL. BSOs working at the PIL are encouraged to \nwrite in referral notes in IPIL when referring someone to secondary. See OBO-2019-030 for \nmore details.\n29 \n \n7.4 Responsibilities of primary examining officers \nBSOs conducting primary examinations are responsible for: \n \nconfirming the identity of the person and verifying that the biometric photograph \nmatches in PIL, when applicable; \n \nquestioning persons and reviewing documentation to determine whether persons \nhave a right to enter Canada (Canadians, PRs and persons registered under the \nIndian Act) or are FNs who may be authorized to enter Canada as temporary \nresidents; \n \ndetermining whether or not persons seeking entry into Canada are doing so as new \nor returning PRs; \n \nauthorizing persons to enter Canada and stamping passports when required. As per \nthe CBSA Stamp Policy, which came into effect on April 2, 2012, BSOs are not \nexpected to notate stamps in passports at the PIL except in the following \ncircumstances: \no \nOfficers will notate the stamp at the PIL (as per the CBSA Operational Bulletin \nPRG-2018-40) when authorizing entry under the \n \nParents and Grandparents Extended Stay Temporary Resident Visa \n(Super Visa), and  \n \nAuthorized Period of Extended Stay;  \no \nOfficers may place a stamp in the holder’s passport on subsequent entry of \npersons with a valid and subsisting status document. \n \nIf a stamp is placed in the passport, the officer will notate the initial \nexpiry according to the status document. \n \nIf a stamp is not placed in the passport, the officer will remind the \nperson of the initial expiry date; \n \nreferring persons for a more detailed Immigration Secondary examination when \nappropriate, in accordance with the Immigration Secondary referral list; and \n \nauthorizing FNs to leave Canada or directing them to return to the U.S. at ports \nwhere there are no BSOs present at the Immigration Secondary. \n7.5 Primary examination questions \nPrimary examination questions are designed to elicit essential information about citizenship, \nresidency, intention, employment, length of stay and identity as quickly as possible. \nNormally, the examining BSO at the PIL begins by asking one or more of the six primary \nquestions below. Under most circumstances, a BSO at the PIL does not need to ask all \nquestions of all travellers. \nIssue \nQuestion \nRationale \nIdentity \nWhat is your \nname? \nIf the BSO has any reason to doubt the person’s \nidentity, they will ask for the person’s name. A \ncomparison can then be made with the person’s \ndocuments to determine if the name given is the same \nas the name in the document.  \nCitizenship \nWhat is your \ncitizenship? \nBy asking this question, the BSO can identify a person \nwho may enter Canada by right. It is rare that a \nperson who has a right to enter Canada be referred to \nImmigration Secondary.\n30 \n \nIf the person is not Canadian, this question enables \nthe BSO to determine whether a passport, a visa or an \nelectronic Travel Authorization (eTA) is required to \nenter Canada. If the person has a machine-readable \npassport, the BSO does not necessarily have to ask \nabout citizenship. A passport reader, however, is no \nsubstitute for a good verbal examination. \nResidency \nWhere do you \nreside? \nThis question helps the BSO to determine, should the \nperson answer they have status in Canada, what their \nobligations and conditions are. If the person is a PR, \nthe BSO may ask the supplementary question “How \nlong have you been away?” The BSO at the PIL must \nrefer for Immigration Secondary examination all PRs \nwho may not comply with the residency obligation of \nA28, which requires PRs to reside in Canada for at \nleast 730 days out of every five-year period to \nmaintain their status. The possible loss of PR status \nunder A46 can be further explored at a secondary \nexamination. \nIntention \nWhat is the \npurpose of your \ntrip to Canada? \nOnce the BSO determines that the traveller is a FN, \nthey must establish why the FN is coming to Canada. \nBy asking this question, they can identify the need for \na referral to Immigration Secondary for control \npurposes (for example, to become a PR, to work, or to \nstudy). \nEmployment \nDo you intend to \ntake or seek \nemployment while \nin Canada? \nIf the BSO has not yet determined whether the person \nis coming to Canada to work, this question ensures \nthat employment opportunities for Canadians are \nprotected and that the person will comply with \nrelevant employment regulations. \nLength of \nstay \nHow long do you \nintend to stay in \nCanada? \nBSOs may allow a FN to enter Canada for a stay of up \nto six months and should stamp the passport of a \nperson who is otherwise admissible. A FN who is \nintending to remain in Canada for longer than six \nmonths should be referred for a Immigration \nSecondary examination. \nThe BSO at the PIL may ask additional questions as warranted but usually does not conduct \nin-depth examinations. This would create line-ups and delays for the travelling public. A \nBSO at the PIL who doubts the bona fides of a person or believes that a detailed \nexamination may be in order should refer the person to an Immigration Secondary \nexamination. \nMost travellers seeking entry at an international airport will use a Primary Inspection Kiosk \n(PIK) instead of being seen by a BSO at the PIL. Travellers in possession of an ePassport \nwill have the photo stored in their passport’s chip compared to their photo taken at the PIK \nto authenticate their identity. If the traveller does not have an ePassport or the system was \nunable to validate their identity, the podium officer will verify their identity by comparing \nthe photograph in the passport with that of the traveller in front of them. Also, travellers \nwho have previously had their biometrics enrolled will be asked to verify their identity via \nfingerprint verification at PIK.\n31 \n \n7.6 Criminality \nBSOs at the PIL shall not ask a FN about criminality during a PIL examination. Questions \nabout criminality are better suited for Immigration Secondary, where BSOs have more time \nto conduct a full examination and to question a person in a more private setting. \nConsequently, when a BSO at the PIL suspects, through questioning, lookouts and IPIL, or \nother indicators, that a FN may have a criminal record, the FN should be referred to an \nImmigration Secondary examination. All BSOs at Immigration Secondary should take care \nto ensure privacy by not questioning a person about criminality in the presence of \naccompanying family members or other travellers. \nNational Crime Information Center (NCIC) queries cannot be conducted as a matter of \ncourse and should never be done as a matter of routine. However, travellers can be queried \nin NCIC if officers have reasonable suspicion indicating criminal activity. If the reasonable \nsuspicion (or reasonable grounds to suspect) standard has been met, name-based checks in \nNCIC for an investigative purpose or for criminal history are authorized on persons \noriginating from or associated with the United States of America or any of its territories.  \n \nBSOs must have completed the mandatory training, M1126-P in the ESS self-service portal \nprior to doing any NCIC query. Refer to OBO-2020-080 on authorized usage by CBSA of the \nNCIC. \nBSOs may refer to the NCIC Quick Reference Guide on Atlas for instructions on how to \nquery NCIC. \n7.7 Referral of FNs with medical conditions \nA38 states that FNs are inadmissible to Canada on health grounds if a medical officer has \nconcluded that the applicant’s health condition: \n \nis likely to be a danger to public health; \n \nis likely to be a danger to public safety; or \n \nmight reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social \nservices. \nReferral for an Immigration Secondary examination is mandatory when a foreign national: \n \nis seeking to enter Canada in order to undergo medical treatment; or \n \nis obviously ill. \nIt is not possible, given the time constraints of the primary examination process, to assess \nthe health status of every FN seeking authorization to enter Canada. BSOs at the PIL should \nadopt a practical approach based partly on visual risk assessment and partly on common \nsense and experience. \nBSOs should not be consciously looking for medical problems as part of their examination \nbut should refer for further examination those whom a reasonable person would judge to be \nill. Examples could include FNs who: \n \nact abnormally;\n32 \n \n \nhave incoherent speech; \n \nare on a stretcher or are accompanied by medical personnel (e.g., nurse, personal \nphysician, etc.); \n \nexhibit obvious signs of illness. \nCertain viruses can lead to widespread epidemics/outbreaks in a specific country and could \neven lead to a global pandemic such as COVID-19 did. In the past, Ebola, Severe Acute \nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 swine flu have threatened the global populations. \nIn response to these epidemics, CBSA and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) work \ntogether to screen travellers who might be infected. BSOs at the PIL are to notify PHAC \nimmediately if they believe a person is showing signs of infection. A PHAC quarantine officer \nwill assess the person, either over the phone or in person depending on your work location, \nand render an opinion. Each POE should have protocols in place for these types of situation. \nBSOs can access a health specialist through the new PHAC Notification Line:  \n1-833-615-2384 and email phac.cns-snc.aspc@canada.ca.  \n \nOn occasion, a FN who is critically ill or injured will be transported to a hospital in Canada \nvia an ambulance. Due to the seriousness of the foreign national’s condition, the BSO may \nfeel that conducting a full primary or secondary examination is not advisable at that time. \nThe BSO should not unduly delay a person who needs urgent medical treatment. \nInformation should be obtained from the emergency medical technician (EMT) as to which \nhospital the FN is being transported to and the FN’s passport should be seized so that the \nBSO can conduct an examination when the FN is release from the hospital. \nFor more information on medical inadmissibility, see section 17 below or visit IRCC’s PDI on \nthe matter. \n7.8 CBSA referral forms  \nThere are various forms that a BSO at the PIL uses to refer a person to the Customs or \nImmigration Secondary examination areas. \nCBSA referral forms \nForm  \nUse  \nExplanation  \nE311  \nPrimarily \nairports \nThe E311 form is completed by passengers on airplanes \ndestined to Canada and by some bus and train passengers. A \npassenger presents the E311 form to the BSO at the primary \ninspection booth, and the BSO verifies the information and \ncodes the form. This form is being phased out and replaced \nwith BSF423. \nBSF423 \nAirports \nThe BSF423 is completed by a BSO when a passenger is \nunable to use the PIK. \nPIK \nreceipt \nAirports with \nPIK \nPrimary Inspection Kiosks (PIK) allow travellers to verify their \ntravel documents, confirm their identity and complete an on-\nscreen declaration. Once completed, the PIK will print a receipt \nfor the traveller to present to a BSO.\n33 \n \nBSF235 \n(E67) \nLand border \ncrossings and \nferry sites \nThe BSF235 form is completed by a BSO at the PIL at land \nborders. \nY28  \nLand border \ncrossings and \nferry sites \nThe Y28 form is completed by a BSO at the PIL for commercial \ndrivers. \nThese forms facilitate the control and streaming of passengers, provide data for Statistics \nCanada and are used to refer passengers to Customs and/or Immigration Secondary.  \nNote: The PIK receipt, E311 and BSF423 forms are not only a referral form but also a \ndeclaration card. While travellers use PIK, complete an E311 or have a BSF423 completed \nby a BSO in air mode, the BSF235 (E67) at land and marine modes is only issued if the \ntraveller or vehicle is referred to a secondary examination. \nThe forms carry a code by which the BSO at the PIL gives the reason for referral to a \nsecondary examination. \nThe immigration portion of the BSF235 (E67) is coded with four letters: T, E, L, and O. \nWhen using the BSF235 (E67), the BSO at the PIL will circle the appropriate letter to \nindicate the reason for referral. \nTELO coding on the BSF235 (E67) \nLetter  \nMeaning \nExplanation  \nT \nTime \nThe person intends to stay in Canada for an extended or unusual \nperiod of time. \nE \nEmployment The person has indicated an intention to seek employment in \nCanada. \nL \nLookout \nThe person may be the subject of a “watch for” as being of \ninterest to CBSA’s BSOs in Immigration Secondary. \nO \nOther \nThis includes any other reason not covered above. In this case, \nthe PIL officer will typically write a few words on the BSF235 (E67) \nto guide the secondary examination. Officers should be cautious \nwhen recording any information on the BSF235 (E67), as the \nperson who is being referred may be able to read the form.  \n8 Secondary examinations \n8.1 Immigration Secondary examinations \nAn Immigration Secondary examination is usually initiated by a referral from a BSO at the \nPIL. It can also result from a referral from a BSO, such as a Disembarkation and Roving \nTeam (DART) member who has boarded and inspected an airplane, bus, train or ship before \nany of the passengers have presented themselves at the PIL. An Immigration Secondary \nexamination is usually conducted by a BSO in the Immigration Secondary area but may be \nconducted by a BSO at Customs Secondary if no BSO at Immigration Secondary is available \nat the POE. An Immigration Secondary examination may also be conducted by telephone or \nother electronic means if the person is in a remote location, where no BSO is available.\n34 \n \n8.2 Responsibilities of examining BSOs at Immigration Secondary \nBSOs conducting Immigration Secondary examinations are responsible for facilitating the \nentry of Canadians, persons registered under the Indian Act, and PRs as well as bona fide \nFNs and identifying inadmissible persons. \nResponsibilities of such officers include: \n \nexamining persons seeking entry to Canada to determine admissibility; \n \nfacilitating the entry of Canadians, PRs and persons registered under the Indian Act; \n \nconfirming identity and biometrics verification; \n \ncollecting biometrics when FNs makes a claim, application or request; \n \nauthorizing FNs to enter Canada as temporary or PRs and issuing documents where \nappropriate; \n \nreceiving refugee claims and determining eligibility to make such claims; \n \nreporting persons who are inadmissible; \n \nreviewing inadmissibility reports; \n \nissuing removal orders, where appropriate, to inadmissible persons; \n \nreferring cases to the Immigration Division, where appropriate, for an admissibility \nhearing; \n \nauthorizing inadmissible persons to enter Canada on a TRP; \n \ndenying entry to inadmissible persons, arranging for their removal and confirming \ntheir departure;  \n \nallowing persons who have indicated that they want to withdraw their application to \nenter Canada to do so and leave Canada; and \n \narresting and/or detaining persons if applicable grounds exist.  \nAll BSOs working at Immigration Secondary are responsible for “closing the loop” in IPIL as \nper OBO-2019-029. \n8.3 Right to counsel at POE examinations \nFor the purpose of routine information-gathering to establish admissibility during an \nImmigration Secondary examination, a person is not entitled to counsel unless arrested or \ndetained. A person who is arrested or detained must be informed without delay of their right \nto counsel and granted the opportunity to retain and instruct counsel. \nThe Supreme Court of Canada has held that an Immigration Secondary examination at a \nPOE does not constitute a detention within the meaning of paragraph 10(b) of the Canadian \nCharter of Rights and Freedoms [Dehghani v. Canada (Minister of Employment and \nImmigration), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 1053]. The Court determined that the principles of \nfundamental justice do not include the right to counsel for routine information-gathering, \nsuch as is gathered at POE examination interviews. \nThis Court decision clarifies that the Charter only gives the right to counsel to those who are \narrested or detained. Generally, CBSA’s policy is not to permit counsel at an examination if \ndetention has not occurred. However, if a BSO is dealing with a FN/PR who does have legal \nrepresentation with them, even though the FN/PR is not entitled to have legal \nrepresentation present, the BSO should allow the legal representative to remain present as \nlong as they do not interfere with the examination process. If the legal representative does\n35 \n \ninterfere, the BSO or Minister’s delegate (MD) can ask the legal representative to leave, as \nthere is no legal obligation to allow them to be present. \nThe right to counsel depends on what transpires after the FN/PR is first subject to \nexamination. For example,  \n \nif a FN/PR is being examined, and the examination does not go beyond what is \nrequired to establish admissibility, the person is not entitled to legal counsel; \n \nif the examination becomes very lengthy and exhaustive but not beyond what is \nrequired to establish admissibility, the FN/PR is not entitled to legal counsel. The \nBSO may, however, consider allowing the person to acquire legal counsel; \n \nif the FN is not restrained in any way but advised to come back the next day for \nfurther examination as outlined in A23, then they are not considered detained, and \nthere is no right to counsel; \n \nif a person is being held for a lengthy period of time and is subject to questioning by \nother agencies, such as the RCMP or CSIS, then this may constitute detention, and \nthe FN should be notified of their right to counsel; \n \nif restraining devices are used, or the person is placed in a holding cell, even \ntemporarily, then an officer must inform the person of the reason for the detention \nand of their right to counsel; and \n \nif the person is arrested for a criminal offence, they must be informed of the reason \nfor the arrest and of their right to counsel. \nAt any time an officer arrests and/or detains a FN or PR they must advise them of their right \nto counsel. The right to counsel is triggered with a physical restriction, such as being placed \nin a restraint or a holding cell, or mentally, when informed of the arrest and or detention. \nFor more information on the right to counsel during POE examination, refer to ENF 6, \nReview of reports under A44(2). \nFor more information on IRPA arrest and detention, including right to counsel, refer to \nimmigration manuals ENF 7, Immigration Investigations and IRPA s. 55 Arrests/Detention \nand ENF 20, Detention. \n8.4 Use of interpreters \nBSOs regularly encounter hundreds of different languages and dialects. Often the person \nseeking entry to Canada does not speak French, English or any other language familiar to \nthe BSO. In such cases, the BSO may be able to authorize entry on the basis of \ndocumentation in the possession of the traveller. In appropriate circumstances, the BSO can \nask accompanying friends or family members to assist in translation. At times, a BSO may \nalso solicit help from staff or other persons who are familiar with the language. This is a \npragmatic practice that allows a BSO to facilitate the entry of travellers in cases where an \nofficial interpreter is not readily available. \nA BSO who is using a non-accredited interpreter to conduct a basic examination should \nsuspend the examination if it becomes apparent that the person may be inadmissible or \nmore intrusive questions need to be asked. The examination can be continued once an IRB’s \naccredited and security-cleared interpreter is available. This is important for the following \nreasons:\n36 \n \n \nWhen making a decision on admissibility, the BSO needs a reliable and trustworthy \ninterpreter in order to be sure that information provided by the client is accurately \ntranslated. Inaccurate translation could result in a decision based on misinformation, \nwhich is detrimental to the person. This would constitute a breach of natural justice. \n \nInformation obtained at examination is often used as evidence in admissibility \nhearings and, less frequently, in criminal prosecutions. If a competent interpreter is \nnot used, the evidence can be discredited or rendered inadmissible. \n \nAll immigration decisions relating to admissibility are subject to judicial review by the \nFederal Court. The Federal Court reviews the fairness of the process leading to the \ndecision and will strike down any decision based on evidence obtained through an \ninterpreter whose competency is in doubt. \n \nIt is to the benefit of both the person and the CBSA that a competent interpreter be \nused in examinations that may lead to a person being found to be inadmissible to \nCanada. \nFurther information on the use of interpreters can be found on IRCC Connexion, Interviews \nand interpreters page. \nGuidelines for the use of telephone interpretation \nTelephone interpretation is a viable alternative to in-person interpretation and should be \nconsidered in order to process refugee claimants, establish identity and purpose of travel, \nissue a removal order, deny entry and detain and/or arrest a FN. BSOs should allow for a \ndegree of discretion when deciding to provide interpretation services in other situations not \nincluded in this list. \nThe following guidelines outline procedures for the use of telephone interpretation when the \nservice is available and appropriate. The BSO should do the following: \n \nDetermine if interpretation services are required. If the person speaks an official \nlanguage of Canada, the BSO asks them if they would be comfortable conducting the \ninterview in that language or if they would like an interpreter. The BSO records this \nin their officer notes. The BSO reiterates throughout the interview that if the person \nshould require an interpreter at any point, the BSO will pursue this request. \n \nSecure an interpreter by accessing the IRB list of accredited interpreters. \n \nFollow port procedures in terms of completing interpreters’ contracts, worksheets \nand obtaining required payment information. \n \nEnsure that the interpreter is alone. \n \nEnsure that the interpreter and the person concerned are not known to each other \nand that there is no conflict of interest. \n \nWhenever operationally feasible, provide refugee claimants the option of being \ninterviewed by an officer of the same sex or gender identity with the assistance of \ninterpreters of the same sex or gender identity when cultural sensitivities or signs of \ngender related persecution exist. \n \nAsk the question “Do you and the interpreter understand one another?” to begin the \ndialogue and to ensure that the person and interpreter understand each other. \n \nUse, when necessary, a series of introductory warm-up questions to observe the \nperson’s ability to respond quickly and easily to the questions and to satisfy the BSO \nthat the interpreter is fluent in both languages. \n \nAsk the person directly whether they are able to clearly understand the interpreter \nand record this question and the person’s response in their officer notes.\n37 \n \n \nAdvise the person and the interpreter to let the BSO know if, at any point in the \nexamination, either the person or the interpreter does not understand or is having \ndifficulties. \n \nRemain vigilant throughout the examination to ascertain if the person is able to \nunderstand the interpretation and communicate effectively. \n \nRead back the information provided by the person through the interpreter in order to \nconfirm that it accurately captures the person’s responses. \n \nWhen processing a refugee claimant, record the name of the telephone interpreter \non the Generic Application Form for Canada [IMM 0008E], the Schedule A – \nBackground/Declaration form [IMM 5669E], and the Interpreter Declaration form \n[IMM 1265B] and note that the interpretation was provided over the phone along \nwith the start and end time of the interview as well as any breaks in interpretation \nservices. \n \nMake a note if more than one interpreter was used with the corresponding names \nand start and end times. \n \nIn the case of unaccompanied minors, contact the relevant child protection office and \nmake every attempt to obtain interpretation services in the interim. \n \nMake attempts to find another interpreter in cases where it is evident that the person \nis unable to communicate through the current interpreter. \n \nIf no interpretation services are available, note on file all attempts that were made to \nsecure these services. This is especially important in cases of detention. \nSituations where it would be inappropriate to conduct a telephone interview include but are \nnot limited to: \n \nCertain cases where travellers are physically and/or mentally challenged. \n \nWhen guidelines for the interpreters are not met, such as  \no \nwhen the interpreter does not have access to a landline or is unable to work \nin a private space; or \no \nwhen telephone line quality or equipment quality makes hearing all parties \nvery difficult.  \n8.5 Confidentiality \nFast-flow counters where BSOs conduct Immigration Secondary examinations are designed \nto deal with cases expeditiously but offer limited privacy. A BSO should take care to \nconsider the sensitive nature of information that may arise during an examination and, \nwhere appropriate, should secure a private setting for the continuation of an examination. \nSuch cases might involve personal medical information or issues of criminality. \nInformation obtained in the course of a secondary examination is confidential. The Privacy \nAct requires that personal information concerning clients be released only to the client or \nthe client’s designated representative. \nSubsection 8(2) of the Privacy Act contains exceptions to this requirement. For example, \npursuant to paragraph 8(2)(f) of the Privacy Act, IRCC has entered into a Statement of \nMutual Understanding (SMU) with the United States Immigration and Naturalization \nService (USINS), now the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the U.S. State \nDepartment (DOS), which permits the exchange of information on persons who are \ninadmissible or whom there are reasonable grounds to believe may be inadmissible or\n38 \n \nsubject to removal. This agreement also allows for the sharing of information between the \nCBSA and the DHS and DOS. \n8.6 Pre-questioning procedures \nBefore questioning a traveller, a BSO at Customs or Immigration Secondary should: \n \nreview the referral information from the PIL, such as that found on the BSF235 \n(E67), E311 or BSF423 forms or the PIK receipt, to identify the reason for the \nreferral; \n \nobtain the person’s relevant identity documents, such as a passport, travel \ndocument, citizenship card, Certificate of Indian Status/Secure Certificate of Indian \nStatus card, Permanent Resident Card or birth certificate; \n \nview the airline ticket of anyone travelling by air;  \n \ndetermine whether the person is in possession of any immigration documents that \nmay assist in quickly establishing the reason the person is seeking entry into \nCanada; and \n \nopen the PIL referral and verify if the person is flagged and what for. \nSee section 13.36 of this manual for information on processing biometrically enrolled FNs at \nPrimary. \n8.7 Global Case Management System (GCMS) checks \nUsing the information on the identity document presented by the person, a BSO at \nImmigration Secondary completes an integrated search in the GCMS. It is a departmental \npolicy that a GCMS check be completed for every person referred for an Immigration \nSecondary examination. During secondary examination, it is mandatory that the BSO \nconduct system queries based on the traveller’s name and date of birth, and not on a \nunique client or application/document number. This will ensure that potential derogatory \ninformation will be identified. Officers must also remain vigilant in identifying close name \nmatches that may be related to the traveller. \nWhere small POEs do not have access to GCMS, they must call another POE in their district \nto get them to run the checks.  \n8.8 Basic questioning \nBasic questioning by BSOs at immigration secondary should cover the following areas, as \nappropriate: \nIssue \nQuestion \nExplanation \nIdentity \nWhat is your name? \nThis will enable the BSO to identify the \nperson. The name should be verified \nagainst the referral card, identity \ndocuments and airline ticket. \nCitizenship \nWhat is your country of \ncitizenship? \nThe BSO should ask this of each \nperson being examined to ensure that \nthe person’s stated citizenship matches \nthe identity document they present.\n39 \n \nThis response will help the BSO \ndetermine passport, visa or eTA \nrequirements. If satisfied that the \nperson is a Canadian citizen, the BSO \nwill allow the person to enter Canada \nwithout further questioning. \nOfficers should show sensitivity with \nthis question as Indigenous Peoples, \nincluding persons registered under the \nIndian Act may not abide by colonial \nviews of citizenship. If the BSO is \npresented with a Certificate of Indian \nStatus (CIS), a Secure Certificate of \nIndian Status (SCIS) or an original \nTemporary Confirmation of \nRegistration Document (TCRD) issued \nby Indigenous Services Canada (ISC), \nthe officer shall allow the person entry \nby right under A19(1). \nResidency \nWhere do you reside? \nEstablishing whether a person is a PR \nmay enable the BSO to authorize entry \ninto Canada with minimal further \ndelay. This question will also help the \nBSO to determine visa, requirements \nand to verify whether the person can \nreturn to the country of residence if it \nis different from the country of \ncitizenship. For example, if the person \nclaims to be a resident of the United \nStates but has a passport of another \ncountry, the BSO may want to see \ntheir US Permanent Resident Card \nbefore authorizing entry into Canada.  \nIntentions \nWhat is the purpose of your trip? \nHow long do you intend to stay \nin Canada? Where in Canada are \nyou planning to go? Do you \nintend to look for work in \nCanada? Do you intend to study \nin Canada? Where will you be \nstaying while in Canada (hotel or \nfriend’s place)? \nIf the person is not someone who may \nenter Canada by right, the BSO should \nestablish the person’s intention in \nseeking entry. Questions such as these \nmay assist in this determination. \nFunds \navailable \nDo you have a return ticket? \nShow it to me please. What \nsources of funds do you have \naccess to while in Canada? \nQuestions such as these are \nappropriate for determining if a FN \npossesses the financial means to carry \nout their intended travel plan and to \ndepart at the end of their authorized \ntime. The BSO should be satisfied that \nthe FN will not take unauthorized \nemployment or have to rely on social \nassistance while in Canada. Additional\n40 \n \nquestioning may be required if a FN \ncannot establish how they will support \nthemselves while in Canada. If they \nindicate that a friend or relative will \nsupport them, it may be advisable to \ncontact the support person to verify \nthis information. \nPersonal \nhistory \nWhat is your occupation? Are \nyou currently employed in your \ncountry? Do you intend to visit \nanyone in Canada? Do you have \nany family or friends in Canada? \nIf the BSO is concerned that a FN may \nnot leave Canada at the end of the \nauthorized time, further questioning \nmay be necessary to establish ties to \nthe foreign national’s homeland. In \nthese cases, questions concerning the \nforeign national’s family both abroad \nand in Canada may be appropriate, \nincluding questions concerning marital \nstatus. \nBackground \nDo you or have you had any \nhealth problems? Have you ever \nbeen arrested, charged or \nconvicted of a crime or an \noffence? Have you ever been \nrefused entry to or removed \nfrom Canada? \nThe person’s past may be relevant to \nadmissibility. Questions such as these \nmay be appropriate for determining \nwhether the person is inadmissible due \nto ill health, criminality or previous \nnon-compliance with immigration \nrequirements. \nSee manual ENF 2, Evaluating Inadmissibility, for more information on determining \nadmissibility. \n8.9 Verifying electronic/digital devices \nAs per the policy guidance, BSOs are responsible for:  \n \ncompleting the Examination of Digital Device online training course (S7188-P) in \norder to conduct digital device examinations; \n \nobtaining approval from their Superintendent/Chief prior to conducting a digital \nexamination; \n \ntaking steps to disable network connectivity; \n \nremaining sensitive to the potential private nature of data stored on digital devices; \nand \n \nmaking timely and comprehensive notes explaining their rationale whenever a \ntraveller's digital device is examined, including what indicators are present and what \ncontravention those indicators are pointing towards. \nFor more information on CBSA’s Policy on Port Of Entry Examinations Of Travellers’ Digital \nDevices, consult CBSA’s Enforcement Manual, part 4, chapter 16. Also, OBO-2021-037, \nOBO-2021-023, OBO-2019-055 and 2020-HQ-AC-10-30 are good references.\n41 \n \n8.10 Travel Documents Issued by Canada for Non-Citizens \nThere are two types of travel documents issued by the government of Canada to protected \npersons and PRs of Canada. These are: \n \nCanada Travel Document (pale blue passport type) – issued to refugees to whom \nCanada has conferred protected person status. Can be used to travel internationality \nexcept to the country against which they claimed protection from. \n \nCertificate of Identity (grey passport type)– issued to PRs of Canada who are not yet \nCanadian citizens and are either stateless or can’t get a travel document for an \nunknown reason. \nTo see examples of these documents, refer to Part 10 of the Guide for Transporters on the \nCBSA’s website. \n9 Examining Canadian citizens at POEs \n9.1 The right to enter Canada \nA Canadian citizen within the meaning of the Citizenship Act has a right to enter and remain \nin Canada pursuant to A19(1). \n9.2 Examination of Canadian citizens \nA15(1) provides for an officer to proceed with an examination if a person makes an \napplication to the officer in accordance with the Act. \nR28(b) provides that a person seeking to enter Canada is making an application. \nAdditionally, A18(1) requires every person seeking to enter Canada to appear for an \nexamination to determine whether they have the right to enter Canada or may be \nauthorized to enter and remain in Canada. This includes Canadian citizens. \nA BSO at Immigration Secondary will normally examine a Canadian citizen only when the \nBSO at the PIL doubts the person’s citizenship. A BSO at Immigration Secondary should \nexamine Canadian citizens as expeditiously as possible. Once the officer establishes that a \nperson is a Canadian citizen, the examination should end, and the person should be allowed \nto enter Canada without further delay. It is not appropriate for BSOs at Immigration \nSecondary to elicit further personal information from a Canadian citizen. \nHowever, Canadian citizens may be asked to willingly provide additional information if it will \nassist a BSO in determining the admissibility of an accompanying foreign national. \n9.3 Determining Canadian citizenship \nBSOs at POEs have the discretion to authorize the entry of Canadian citizens, even in the \nabsence of documentation. For more details, see section 9.4 of this manual.\n42 \n \nThe following documents are acceptable proof of Canadian citizenship: \n \nCanadian passport (regular, diplomatic, special or temporary); \n \nEmergency Travel Document for a Single Journey Only document (a BSO at the PIL \nwill automatically refer for an Immigration secondary examination a person in \npossession of a this document. Once the person’s identity has been verified, the BSO \nat Immigration Secondary retains the document and forwards it to: \nPassport Program Integrity Branch \nAttention: Intelligence Division, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship \nCanada \n70 Crémazie, 3rd floor \nGatineau, Quebec, J8Y 3P2 \n \nEnhanced Driver’s License (EDL) and/or the Enhanced Identification Card (EIC). \nThe following documents are good indicators of Canadian citizenship however must be \nsupported by other Canadian government issued photo-identification.  \n \nCertificate of Canadian Citizenship (Issued on or after February 1, 2012: 8.5 x 11 \npaper format or the wallet-sized card issued before February 1, 2012); \n \nA Canadian provincial/territorial birth certificate; \n \nCertificate of Naturalization issued before January 1, 1947; \n \nCertificate of Registration of Birth Abroad issued between January 1, 1947, and \nFebruary 14, 1977, inclusively; and  \n \nCertificate of Retention of Canadian Citizenship issued between January 1, 1947 and \nFebruary 14, 1977, inclusively.  \nSee if you may be a citizen is a useful link in determining if someone may be a Canadian \ncitizen. \nTo see examples of these documents, refer to Part 10 of the Guide for Transporters on the \nCBSA’s website and the Government of Canada’s public website concerning travel \ndocuments. \nMore information on documents can be found in ENF 32, Passports and Travel Documents. \n9.4 Establishing citizenship without documents \nCanadian citizens returning to Canada by air usually have to provide proof of identity and \ncitizenship to get on the flight. Canadian citizens arriving at land borders, however, will \nfrequently be without satisfactory documentary proof of Canadian citizenship. In these \ncases, the BSO should question the person until the BSO is satisfied with the person’s claim \nof Canadian citizenship. Once the BSO is satisfied that the person is a Canadian citizen, the \nperson must be allowed to enter Canada without further delay.\n43 \n \n9.5 Citizenship record searches \nBSOs at Immigration Secondary may request a search of citizenship records by emailing the \nCitizenship Case Processing Centre in Sydney (CPC-S), Nova Scotia, at CPC-SYDNEY-\nSEARCHENQ@cic.gc.ca. \nThe official response will be provided via email. Where a record letter is required, BSOs at \nImmigration Secondary must follow up the email request by submitting a completed \nApplication for a Search of Citizenship Records form [CIT 0058E]. A written response will be \nforwarded by facsimile as well as by regular mail. \nNote: Citizenship searches will only reveal if a person has obtained Canadian citizenship \nthrough naturalization. The Sydney CPC does not keep records of persons who are Canadian \ncitizens by birth. Proof of citizenship by birth can be established by a search of provincial \nbirth certificates or baptismal records. \nAfter a person has received Canadian citizenship, the information is entered into GCMS.  \n9.6 Canadian Travel Documents \nThe Canadian passport comes in four categories: regular, special, diplomatic and temporary.  \nFor Canadian citizens who are abroad and in need of a Canadian travel document to return \nto Canada, Consular Services can issue another type of travel document in urgent cases. \nThis is: \n \nThe Emergency Travel Document for a Single Journey Only - may be issued at a \nCanadian visa office abroad to facilitate the return of a Canadian citizen. It may also \nbe issued as a one-trip document for travel from a Canadian visa office abroad \nwithout passport services to another office with full passport services in another \ncountry. \nThe Emergency Travel Document for a Single Journey Only is a single page document \nprinted on 8.5 x 11 security paper serially numbered. \nBSOs at the PIL are required to refer holders of this document for an Immigration \nSecondary examination. The Passport Office requires the surrender of an emergency \npassport immediately on the holder’s arrival in Canada or at the destination for which the \npassport was issued. BSOs at Immigration Secondary recover the emergency passport and \npromptly forward it to: \nPassport Program Integrity Branch \nAttn: Intelligence Division \nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada \n70 Crémazie, 3rd Floor \nGatineau, Quebec J8Y 3P2 \nA space is provided on the back of the document for a signature indicating that the \ndocument has been received.\n44 \n \nIn circumstances where the traveller has not reached their final destination upon arrival at a \nPOE and will be boarding a domestic flight, the BSO may use discretion to provide the \ntraveller with a photocopy of the emergency travel document to present to the airline for \nidentification validation when boarding. The BSO may also issue their contact information \n(e.g., a business card) for the traveller to provide to the airline should verification be \nrequired. \nTo see examples of these documents, refer to Part 10 of the Guide for Transporters on the \nCBSA’s website. \n10 Examining people who are registered under the Indian Act at \nPOEs \nA19(1) provides that every person registered under the Indian Act (Canadian legislation), \nwhether or not that person is a Canadian citizen, has the right to enter and remain in \nCanada. \n \nSection 6 of the Indian Act specifies (subject to provisions in section 7) persons entitled to \nbe registered under the Indian Act. Under the terms of the Indian Act, Indian status in \nCanada—and inclusion in the Indian register maintained by Indigenous Services \nCanada (ISC)—is not determined on the basis of Canadian citizenship but rather on the \ndegree of descent from ancestors who were registered or entitled to be registered as \nIndians. As a result, it is possible for a FN to be recognized as registered under the Indian \nAct and have the right to enter and remain in Canada under A19(1). \nA15(1) provides the authority for an officer to proceed with an examination where a person \nmakes an application to the officer. R28(b) provides that a person seeking to enter Canada \nis making an application. Additionally, A18(1) requires every person seeking to enter \nCanada to appear for an examination to determine if they have the right to enter Canada or \nis or may become authorized to enter and remain in Canada. This includes people who are \nregistered under the Indian Act. If a BSO at PIL is not satisfied that the person is registered, \nthe officer can make a referral to Immigration Secondary. Once the officer establishes that a \nperson is registered under the Indian Act, the immigration examination should end, and the \nperson must be allowed to enter Canada without further delay.  \nIf a FN is a person registered under the Indian Act, they are authorized to work and study in \nCanada without a permit, per R186(x) and R188(d). See PRG-2018-72 for details. \n \nNote: When examining people who are registered under the Indian Act, officers should be \naware of People Processing Manual, part 1, chapter 4, paragraphs 21 to 28, Articles of \nReligious, Spiritual and Cultural Significance. \n10.1 Determining status of registration under the Indian Act \nBSOs at POEs have the discretion to authorize the entry of persons registered under the \nIndian Act, even in the absence of documentation. Acceptable documents establishing one’s \nstatus as registered under the terms of the Indian Act include the Certificate of Indian \nStatus (CIS) and the Secure Certificate of Indian Status cards (SCIS). Both are commonly \nreferred to as the status card and are produced by ISC. The paper-laminate CIS card is \nissued in partnership with First Nations in 500 communities across Canada through ISC’s\n45 \n \nIndian Registration Administrator Program. An original Temporary Confirmation of \nRegistration Document (TCRD) issued by ISC may also be used as proof of Indian \nstatus.The SCIS is an identity card with enhanced security features. Some but not all SCIS \nfeature a machine readable zone (MRZ). \nSubject to an application process, the CIS and SCIS cards are issued to adults, children and \ndependent adults listed in the Indian Register. The Indian Register, which is maintained by \nISC, is the official record identifying people who are registered under the Indian Act. Bands \nalso have the option of determining their own membership.  \nIf BSOs require verification of a person being registered under the Indian Act, or if officers \nhave reason to doubt the authenticity of a card being presented, they may contact the \nsupervisor of Registration Services at: \n \nSecure Certificate of Indian Status Application Centre \nM006-15 Eddy Street \nGatineau, QC K1A 0H4 \nFax: 1-819-994-2622 \n \nHours of operation: 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) \nToll-free telephone: 1-800-567-9604 \nEmail: InfoPubs@aadnc-aandc.gc.ca \n10.2 Establishing status of registration under the Indian Act without \ndocuments \nPeople who are registered under the Indian Act and who are seeking entry to Canada may \nnot be in possession of documentary proof of their status. In such cases, the BSO should \nquestion the person until they are satisfied with the person’s status. The officer’s decision \non ascertaining identity and status is based on all the evidence presented at that time, \nincluding verbal statements and documentation. Once the BSO is satisfied that the person is \nregistered under the Indian Act, the person must be allowed into Canada without further \ndelay. Border processing of people who are not registered under the Indian Act is discussed \nin the following paragraph. \n10.3 American Indians1 who are not registered in Canada \nThe authorization of entry to Canada is governed solely by IRPA and IRPR. Travellers who \ndo not meet criteria for a right of entry under A19 are treated as FNs and must meet \nadmissibility and documentary requirements, such as visas and eTAs, to be allowed to enter \nCanada. \n \nFor example, Native Americans (also could be identified by the U.S. legal term “American \nIndians”) who may have cultural or family connections to First Nations in Canada, but who \n                                                      \n1 American Indian is the legal term; Native American is the preferred term in the U.S.\n46 \n \nare not Canadian citizens, PRs of Canada or registered under the Indian Act, do not have \nright of entry under A19. \n \nMany First Nations people from Canada and the U.S. assert a right to mobility across the \nCanada–U.S. border, which in their view, is recognized in Article III of the Jay Treaty of \n1794, an international agreement between the U.S. and Great Britain. The courts in Canada, \nhowever, have found that the Jay Treaty was abrogated by the War of 1812, and it is not a \ntreaty conferring rights to Indigenous peoples under Canada’s laws. \nAs a result, Native Americans coming to work or study in Canada who are not registered \nunder the Indian Act require a WP or SP. Some travellers in these circumstances may object \nto being processed as FNs to enter Canada. BSOs should deal tactfully with cases of this \nnature while still upholding the requirements of the IRPA. \nCanada’s immigration laws regarding the entry of North American Indigenous peoples differ \nfrom those of the U.S. Under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, a right of entry to \nthe U.S. for the purposes of employment and residence is recognized for “American Indians \nborn in Canada”. This right is conditional, however, on a person being able to demonstrate \nthat, under the terms of the law, they “possess at least 50 per centum of blood of the \nAmerican Indian race”. \nIn the case of First Nations people from Canada, the U.S. provides an indication that it \naccepts the CIS and SCIS card, issued to people who are registered under the Indian Act by \nISC, as evidence of meeting the prescribed “blood quantum” criteria. In some cases, \nhowever, more evidence is required. \nIndications from concerned U.S. government departments are that the proof of meeting the \nblood quantum requirement is sufficient to establish both a right of entry and a right to \nwork and reside permanently in the U.S. without obtaining PR status, more commonly \nknown in the U.S. as a “green card.” \n \n10.4 Haudenosaunee passport \nFor information on travellers seeking to enter Canada with the Haudenosaunee passport, \nplease consult operational bulletin OPS-2011-03. \n11 Examining Permanent Residents (PRs) at POEs \nA2(1) defines a permanent resident as a person who: \n \nhas acquired PR status; and \n \nhas not subsequently lost that status under A46. \n11.1 Rights of PRs \nA27(1) provides that a permanent resident has the right to enter and remain in Canada \nsubject to the provisions of the Act.\n47 \n \nA19(2) requires a BSO to allow a permanent resident to enter Canada if satisfied following \nan examination on their entry that they have that status. \nPRs who are under enforcement proceedings keep their PR status and retain the right to \nenter Canada until a final determination of their loss of status has been made. \n11.2 Verifying PR status \nThe Permanent Resident Card is the best evidence of PR status in Canada. \nThe following documents may be satisfactory indicators of permanent residence: \n \nthe original Record of Landing (such as IMM 1000); \n \na certified true copy of a Record of Landing document issued by IRCC National \nHeadquarters (NHQ); \n \na letter issued by IRCC NHQ verifying permanent residence; \n \na passport duly stamped showing the date on which permanent residence was \ngranted if the person was granted PR status before 1973; \n \na Confirmation of Permanent Residence form [IMM 5292B or IMM 5688]; and \n \na permanent resident travel document (visa counterfoil). \nCBSA’s website lists acceptable travel and identity documents. \n11.3 Establishing PR status without documents \nBSOs at POEs have the discretion to authorize the entry of PRs, even in the absence of \ndocumentation. If documentary evidence is not available, the BSO at Immigration \nSecondary must establish the person’s PR status by questioning the person and checking \nthe person’s status in GCMS. The status of persons who became PRs before 1973 has to be \nverified by contacting the Operations Support Centre at IRCC’s National Headquarters at \nOSC-CSO@cic.gc.ca. However, the burden of proof lies on the person who is claiming to be \na PR at a POE. An adjournment for further examination can be done under A23 to allow the \nperson to get their documents and return to the POE to show the BSO.  \n11.4 Investigating PRs for inadmissibility \nWhen a PR appears at a POE for examination, the BSO must determine whether the person \nis a PR. The person is considered a FN until the BSO is satisfied that the person is a PR. The \nburden of proof lies on the person at a POE examination. \nBSOs must remain cognizant of the fact that A19(2) gives permanent residents of Canada the \nright to enter Canada at a POE once it is established that a person is a PR, regardless of non-\ncompliance with the residency obligation in A28 or the presence of other inadmissibility grounds. \nMeaning, should a BSO write up an A44(1) report for non-compliance and the superintendent \nissue a departure order that is not in force, the person still has the right to enter Canada until a \nfinal determination has been made regarding their loss of PR status and the removal order \nbecomes in force.\n48 \n \nBSOs can not refuse entry to a PR. However, once a person has lost their PR status under A46, \nthey are considered a FN and may be inadmissible if they do not meet the requirements of the \nAct. For example, when a final determination has been made outside of Canada that the PR has \nfailed to comply with the residency obligations, or when a removal order comes into force and all \ntheir rights to appeal have passed.  \nHowever, as per A27(1), this right to enter and remain in Canada is subject to the provisions of \nthe Act, and does not preclude the CBSA from ensuring that PRs are in compliance with IRPA and \nthus admissible to Canada. During the process of determining that a person is a PR, BSOs will \nsometimes become aware of evidence of inadmissibility. The BSO should explain to the person \nthat while it has been established that they have a right to enter Canada, there is some reason \nto believe they could be the subject of a report under IRPA which could lead to the issuance of a \nremoval order.  \nOfficers should always remain aware of the principles of procedural fairness in these proceedings. \nThe PR must be given a fair opportunity to know the case to be met; to provide evidence in order \nto correct or contradict any concerns related to admissibility; and to have the evidence fully and \nfairly considered by the decision-maker. \nIn cases where: \n \nPR status is established; and \n \nthe BSO believes on a balance of probabilities that the person is in non-compliance with \nIRPA for failure to comply with residency obligation (A41(b), A28) or for \nmisrepresentation (A40); or \n \nthe BSO has reasonable ground to believe that the person is inadmissible to Canada for \nany other reasons outlined at A34, A35, A36(1) or A37, \nthe BSO at Immigration Secondary may report the person (pursuant to A44(1)) if there is \nsufficient evidence to support an inadmissibility allegation. In the absence of sufficient evidence \nto support the writing of an inadmissibility report, the BSO may enter any available information \ninto an Info Alert in GCMS without delay (date of entry, last country of embarkation, current \naddress in Canada, etc.) and forward notification of the same to a CBSA inland office in Canada \nto determine whether an investigation is warranted.  \nFor more information on assessing inadmissibility, refer to ENF 1, Inadmissibility and ENF 2, \nEvaluating inadmissibility. \nFor more information on procedures for dealing with clients who fail to meet the residency \nobligation, refer to ENF 23, Loss of Permanent Resident Status.  \nQuestioning Permanent Residents Regarding Cessation (A108) and Vacation (A109): \nIn cases where the PR was granted Convention Refugee or Protected Person status prior to \nbecoming a PR, and the BSO has suspicions that the individual has: \n \nvoluntarily reavailed themself of the protection of their country of nationality; \n \nvoluntarily reacquired their nationality;\n49 \n \n \nacquired a new nationality and enjoys the protection of the country of that new \nnationality;  \n \nhas voluntarily become re-established in the country that they left or remained \noutside of and in respect of which they claimed refugee protection in Canada; or \n \nhas obtained protected status directly or indirectly via misrepresentation or \nwithholding  of material facts relating to a relevant matter; \nthe BSO may ask questions of a PR where the officer suspects, on a balance of probabilities, the \nexistence of a potential inadmissibility under A40(1)(c) or A40.1(1) or A40.1(2) in relation to the \ncessation (A108) and/or vacation (A109) of refugee protection. \nThe BSO, for example, may ask questions about: \n \nwhether the person has travelled to the country of persecution;  \n \nwhy they returned;  \n \nfor what length of time they were there.   \nThe BSO may also make photocopies of documentation presented at the time of examination.  \nThe BSO must have reasonable grounds to believe that the documents that are photocopied are \nrelevant to a potential inadmissibility under A40(1)(c) or A40.1(1) or A40.1(2) and that the \nphotocopies would be reasonably required should the CBSA file an application under A108 or \nA109 with the IRB.   \nAny information gathered should be forwarded to the appropriate Hearings Office via the \nBSF729E form. For more information, see IRCC’s Program Delivery Instructions (PDI) on the \nsubject. \n11.5 Permanent Resident Card  \nThe PR card is the status document referred to in A31(1) that indicates that the holder is a \nPR of Canada. A person who holds a PR card is presumed to have PR status unless a BSO at \nImmigration Secondary determines otherwise. The PR card, or, alternatively, the A31(3) \ntravel document issued by one of Canada’s visa offices, is the prescribed document for PRs \nwhen boarding a commercial transporter bound for Canada. \nCanadian PRs need to show their card when travelling to Canada in order to prove their PR \nstatus. PRs who do not have a PR card or who are not carrying their PR card when travelling \noutside the country will need to obtain a PR travel document (counterfoil) before returning \nto Canada by air mode in order to comply with eTA requirements.  \nFor more information on the PR card, refer to ENF 27, Permanent Resident Card. \n11.6 Prescribed document \nA148(1)(a) prohibits commercial transporters from carrying to Canada a person who does \nnot hold a prescribed document. R259 makes the PR card a prescribed document for the \npurpose of A148. Valid PR cards and A31(3) travel documents are prescribed documents for \nestablishing PR status. Consequently, the PR card or the A31(3) travel document is the \nprescribed document for PRs for the purposes of boarding a commercial transporter (e.g., \naircraft, train or ship) bound for Canada.\n50 \n \n11.7 Permanent resident cards with one-year validity date \nR54(2) provides that a PR card will be issued with a validity of one year instead of five years \nas per R54(1) if the PR: \n \nis subject to a process set out in A46(1)(b) until there has been a final \ndetermination; \n \nis the subject of a report prepared under A44(1) that is being considered by the \nMinister; \n \nis the subject of a removal order made by the Minister pursuant to A44(2) and the \nperiod for filing an appeal from the decision has not expired or, if an appeal is filed, \nthere has been no final determination of the appeal; or \n \nis the subject of a report under A44(1) that has been referred by the Minister to the \nImmigration Division (ID) under A44(2) and the period for filing an appeal from the \ndecision of the ID has not expired or, if an appeal is filed, there has been no final \ndetermination of the appeal. \n11.8 Travel document \nA31(3) states the following: \nA PR outside Canada who is not in possession of a status document indicating PR status \nshall, following an examination, be issued a travel document if a visa officer at a visa office \nis satisfied that: \n(a) they comply with the residency obligation under A28; \n(b) an officer has made the determination referred to in A28(2)(c); or \n(c) they were physically present in Canada at least once within the 365 days before \nthe examination and they have made an appeal under A63(4) that has not been \nfinally determined or the period of making such an appeal has not yet expired. \nThe purpose of the travel document is to facilitate the return of all PRs to Canada. This \nincludes those who may have lost their PR card while outside of Canada as well as those \nwho are appealing a decision made outside Canada that they failed to meet the residency \nobligation under A28. \nThe travel document will take the same form as a temporary resident visa counterfoil that is \nplaced in a passport or travel document. It is usually valid for one entry to Canada simply to \nfacilitate the PR’s return, but it may be issued for multiple entries. \nIf the travel document was issued for a single entry, the BSO is to strikethrough the \ncounterfoil upon entry to Canada by drawing a line from the top left of the counterfoil to the \nbottom right. The BSO at Immigration Secondary would counsel the PR that they may apply \nfor a PR card from within Canada. If the travel document was issued for multiple entries, it \nshould be treated like a multiple-entry temporary resident visa.\n51 \n \n11.9 Coding on the travel document \nPRs who have demonstrated that they have complied with the residency obligation listed in \nA28 will be issued counterfoils bearing the coding “R”. \n \nIn cases where PRs have not met the residency requirement, but humanitarian and \ncompassionate considerations grounds exist to support the retention of their status \npursuant to A28(2)(c), a counterfoil bearing the coding “RC” will be issued. \n \nIn cases where the document has been issued pursuant to A31(3)(c) where an \nappeal of a loss of status determination is filed or the time period for filing an appeal \nhas not expired, and the person has been physically present in Canada at least once \nin the past 365 days, the counterfoil will bear the coding “RX”. \n \nIn cases where the PR does not meet the residency obligation and no humanitarian \nand compassionate grounds exist, but the Immigration Appeal Division has ordered \nthe PR to appear in person at the hearing, a counterfoil bearing the coding “RA” will \nbe issued. \nCounterfoils bearing the “RX” code or the “RA” code will be mandatory referrals to \nImmigration Secondary for BSOs at the PIL. \nIf a person with a counterfoil bearing the “RX” or “RA” coding is returning to Canada to \nattend an appeal of a decision made outside of Canada regarding loss of status or an appeal \nhas yet to be filed and the period for filing has not expired, the BSO at Immigration \nSecondary should authorize entry without delay if satisfied that no final determination has \nbeen made with respect to the person’s loss of PR status. The BSO at Immigration \nSecondary should update GCMS with the person’s date of entry into Canada and current \naddress. \nThe principal difference between a travel document and a one-year PR card is the period of \nvalidity. The travel document is used to return to Canada, while the PR card remains valid \nuntil the outcome of an appeal is decided or until the period for making an appeal expires. \nSince the PR is already pending a determination by the Immigration Appeal Division, the \nBSO should not prepare an A44(1) report for the same inadmissible grounds at the POE. \n11.10 Persons appealing the loss of PR status \nBSOs at Immigration Secondary who encounter a person in possession of a PR card issued \nwith a one-year validity should check GCMS to determine whether there is a final \ndetermination that the person has lost their status under A46. If the person is returning to \nCanada to attend the appeal of a decision made outside Canada regarding the loss of status \nor an appeal has yet to be filed, and if the period for filing has not expired and that person \nis in possession of a travel document, the BSO must acknowledge their right of entry \nwithout delay if satisfied that no final determination has been made with respect to the \nperson’s loss of status. \nThe BSO should update GCMS with the person’s date of entry into Canada, current address \nin Canada and contact information. \nUpon a final determination of loss of PR status, a person becomes a foreign national. Should \nthey return to Canada, they must be assessed to determine if they meet the requirements\n52 \n \nof the Act and Regulations for entry as a temporary resident, even if they still possess a PR \ncard . For more information, refer to ENF 23, Loss of Permanent Resident Status. \n11.11 PRs holding other travel documents  \nPRs may also travel to Canada with a Canadian Travel Document (pale blue passport-type), \na Canadian Certificate of Identity or a Single Journey Travel Document. Where a PR travels \non one of these documents in air mode, the PR must be in possession of a PR card or PR \ntravel document (counterfoil). \n11.12 Residency obligation for PRs \nA28(1) states that a PR must comply with the residency obligation with respect to every \nfive-year period. A28(2) stipulates that a PR complies with this obligation if, on each of a \ntotal of at least 730 days in that five-year period, they are: \n \nphysically present in Canada; \n \noutside Canada accompanying a Canadian citizen spouse or common-law partner or, \nin the case of a child, their parent; \n \noutside Canada employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or by the \npublic service of Canada or of a province; \n \noutside Canada accompanying a PR spouse or common-law partner or, in the case of \na child, their parent, who is employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or \nby the public service of Canada or of a province; or \n \nable to meet other conditions for compliance that are set out in the Regulations. \nWhen BSOs are assessing the residency obligation, the period considered is limited to the \nfive years immediately preceding the examination. If a person has been a PR for less than \nfive years, they must be able to comply with the residency obligation for the five-year \nperiod immediately after becoming a PR. \nFor more specifications on how to apply A28(2), refer to R61.  \nFor more information on loss of PR status, see ENF 23, Loss of Permanent Resident Status. \nSince November 2014, regulatory amendments came into force giving the decision to \nvoluntarily renounce PR status the force of law. For more information, refer to IRCC’s \nProgram Delivery Instructions and Operational Bulletin PRG-2014-066. \n11.13 Issuing removal orders for failure to comply with PR obligations \nThe decision that a PR has lost their status may be made outside Canada by a visa officer, \nwhereas, at a POE, if following an examination of a PR, an officer concludes that a PR has \nfailed to comply with the residency obligation under A28, the officer may prepare a report \nfor inadmissibility under A41(b), taking into account prescribed considerations set in the \nIRPA. A28(2)(c) specifically requires officers and the MD to take into account humanitarian \nand compassionate considerations, including the best interests of a child directly affected by \nthe determination, when assessing whether such considerations overcome any breach of the \nresidency obligation prior to the determination. Officers must articulate consideration of \nthese prescribed factors in the decision to write a report under A44(1) and/or their\n53 \n \nrecommendation to the MD. These considerations must be written in the  Examination’s \nNotes tab without delay by both the BSO and the MD. If the report is well founded, and \ninsufficient humanitarian grounds exist, the MD will issue a departure order pursuant to \nR228(2). \nThe PR has the right to appeal the decision made outside Canada or at the POE to the \nImmigration Appeal Division, pursuant to A63. PRs who have been issued a removal order \nmaintain their right of entry until the appeal period has elapsed; therefore, BSOs should \nallow entry into Canada until a final determination of status is made. \nFor more information, see the following manuals: \n \nENF 2, Evaluating Inadmissibility \n \nENF 5, Writing 44(1) Reports \n \nENF 23, Loss of permanent resident status \n \nENF 6, Review of reports under A44(1) \n \nENF 19, Appeals before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration \nand Refugee Board (IRB) \n11.14 Other inadmissibility allegations \nIf a BSO believes a PR is inadmissible for reasons other than failure to comply with the \nresidency obligation (A28), they are still required to allow the person to come into Canada. \nIf the PR does not wish to answer any further questions, the BSO at Immigration Secondary \nshould attempt to obtain sufficient information (including current address, phone number, \nand employment location) to enable follow-up action from an inland office.  \nSee ENF 2, Evaluating Inadmissibility, for more information on determining inadmissibility. \n11.15 Arrest and detention of PRs \nIf an immigration arrest warrant was issued against a PR pursuant to A55(1), the BSO must \nexecute the warrant and arrest the PR. The BSO may then release the PR from detention if \nreasons for detention no longer exist as per A56. \nIn certain circumstances, PRs may also be detained under A55(3), if a BSO believes it \nnecessary to complete the examination or they have reasonable grounds to suspect is \ninadmissible on grounds of security (A34), violating human or international rights (A35), \nserious criminality (A36(1)), criminality (A36(2)) or organized criminality (A37). \nFor more information on arrest and detention procedures, refer to ENF 7, Immigration \nInvestigations and IRPA s. 55 Arrest/Detention and ENF 20, Detention. \n11.16 Seizing PR visas and permanent resident cards \nA140(1) authorizes an officer to seize and hold a document or other thing if the officer \nbelieves on reasonable grounds that: \n \nit was fraudulently or improperly obtained or used;\n54 \n \n \nthe seizure is necessary to prevent its fraudulent use or improper use; or \n \nthe seizure is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act. \nEven if the BSO prepares an A44(1) report against the PR, unless provisions of A140(1) are \nmet, the PR card should be kept by the holder, who will retain their PR status until a final \ndecision is made respecting their loss of status. Pending this decision, A31 requires that a \nPR be provided with a status document. R53(1) provides that the status document is the PR \ncard. \nBSOs may seize these documents if they have reason to believe that the documents were \nfraudulently issued or obtained or if they are trying to prevent improper or fraudulent use of \nthese documents. For example, if there is a final determination that the person has lost \ntheir PR status or renounced their status, the BSO may seize and retain the documents in \norder to prevent their improper use, such as using it to travel to Canada instead of \nobtaining a TRV or eTA. \n12 Examining FNs seeking to become PRs at POEs \n12.1 Permanent resident visas and Confirmation of Permanent \nResidence (CoPR) documents \nUnder R70(1), permanent residence applicants are issued a PR visa when a visa officer was \nsatisfied that, at the time of issuance, the FN named in the document was not inadmissible \nand met the selection criteria and requirements of the Act and Regulations. This visa and \nCoPR document [IMM 5688] are to be presented at the POE for processing in order to \nbecome a PR. \nIn December 2011, the use of a counterfoil was eliminated for countries that are visa-\nexempt. The CoPR is now evidence that a visa officer was satisfied.  \n12.2 Examination of FNs with PR visas/CoPR \nWhen an applicant in possession of a CoPR/PR visa applies to become a PR at a POE, the \nrole of the BSO at Immigration Secondary is to: \n \nverify the applicant’s identity; \n \nconfirm that the information on the CoPR/PR visa is correct; \n \nestablish that the applicant complies with all requirements of the Act and Regulations \nand is not inadmissible; \n \nconfirm that the applicant’s marital, common-law, or family status has not changed \nsince the issuance of the CoPR/PR visa; \n \nconfirm that the applicant and their family members (whether accompanying or not) \nstill meet the requirements of the class of PRs under which the CoPR/PR visa was \nissued; \n \nimpose and explain any appropriate conditions; and \n \nwelcome the new PR to Canada and provide information about programs and \nservices available to facilitate integration into Canadian society.\n55 \n \nThe Regulations require that a FN in possession of a CoPR/PR visa and who is seeking to \nbecome a PR:  \n \nInform the officer at examination if their marital status has changed since the \nCoPR/PR visa was issued, as required by R51(a)(i); and \n \nof any other facts relevant to the issuance of the CoPR/PR visa that have changed \nsince the visa was issued, or that the FN failed to disclose at the time the CoPR/PR \nvisa was issued, as required by R51(a)(ii). \n \nEstablish that they and their family members, accompanying or not, meet the \nrequirements of the Act and Regulations, as required at R51(b). \nThe applicant must be able to show upon landing that their dependents meet the medical \nand criminal criteria. The BSO should check GCMS for any notes added by the visa office to \nensure they were not aware of any changes in the application. Applicants are asked to \ninform the visa office immediately of any change in the composition of their family. If they \nhave not done so, prior to their CoPR/PR visa issuance, a new application will be required \nfor all family members. \nIf the BSO at Immigration Secondary establishes that the FN failed to notify of the changes \nto their marital status or did not declare a dependent before or after the issuance of the \nCoPR/PR visa, the BSO may prepare a report under A44(1) with the specific regulation \nstated above that they did non comply with. The MD, if they find the report well founded, \nwill defer the case for inquiry at the ID under R229(1)(n). \nFor more information on report writing, refer to ENF 5, Writing 44(1) Reports. \n12.3 GCMS check \nBSOs at Immigration Secondary conduct an integrated name search in GCMS for every FN \nin possession of a CoPR who is seeking to establish permanent residence in Canada. A name \nsearch may reveal that the person has multiple FOSS client identification numbers (IDs) or \nGCMS Unique Client Identifiers (UCIs), in which case the BSO should create a household to \nassociate the UCIs/IDs together by following the step-by-step on Wiki.  \nFOSS ID or GCMS UCI numbers under which warrants were issued or sponsorship files must \nbe maintained as the primary identification. \nBSOs ensure that there is no information recorded in GCMS that would alter the decision to \ngrant permanent residence. \nFor example, there may be an outstanding warrant for the applicant’s arrest, or the \napplicant may have been previously deported from Canada. BSOs at Immigration Secondary \nshould carefully review any adverse information to determine whether the applicant satisfies \nall the requirements of the Act and Regulations. In some cases, it may be useful for the \nexamining BSO to contact the officer who issued the CoPR/PR visa to confirm whether this \ninformation would have altered the favorable decision. In some cases, the BSO may need to \ndefer the examination, pursuant to A23, in order to obtain more information before deciding \nwhether to grant PR status.\n56 \n \n12.4 Documents required by FNs seeking PR status \n \nR50(1) specifies the type of passport, travel or identity document that an applicant \nmust have in their possession to be given PR status. This document is necessary to \nverify the identity of the person seeking permanent residence. \n \nR50(2) provides that a protected person who has been issued a PR visa may become \na PR when it is not possible for them to obtain a passport, identity document, or \ntravel document. \n \nR6 specifies that applicants who are citizens of certain countries must have a PR visa \n(coded IM). \n \nConfirmation of Permanent Residence document (IMM 5688); \n \nProof of settlement funds for those in the Federal Skilled Worker Program and the \nFederal Skilled Trades Program; and \n \nA Certificat de Sélection du Québec/ Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) for those \nwanting to reside in the province of Québec. \n \n12.5 Confirmation of Permanent Residence document [IMM 5688]  \nSuccessful permanent residence applicants are issued the Confirmation of Permanent \nResidence document [IMM 5688] from a Canadian consulate or visa office. The Confirmation \nof Permanent Residence (CoPR) is evidence that an officer was satisfied at the time of \nissuance, that the FN named in the document was not inadmissible and otherwise met the \nrequirements of the Act and its associated regulations. \nThe CoPR is printed in two copies on regular 8 1/2 x 14 white paper and one copy contains \na photo of the holder.  \nThe CoPR by itself is not a prescribed document as per R259 to board a means of \ntransportation to Canada. CoPR holders will be issued a visa counterfoil [IMM 1346] bearing \nthe coding “IM” in order to facilitate their boarding for those needing a TRV to travel to \nCanada. For visa-exempt FNs, an IMM 5785 e-Foil (electronic facilitation counterfoil) coded  \nIM will be issued. \nWhen a FN arrives at a POE to become a PR and is in possession of a CoPR, the BSO at \nImmigration Secondary should adhere to the following procedures : \n \nexamine the passport and any other identity documents provided; \n \nuse the applicant’s passport and other identity documents to confirm that each name \nis correctly spelled and that the family and first names are clearly identified; \n \nverify the date of birth with the identity documents provided by the applicant (the \nday and month are sometimes transposed due to different international systems for \ndisplaying the date); \n \nfor CoPRs where a clerical error has been identified, BSOs must correct the \nIMM 5688E form to ensure it is consistent with the biographical data in the passport \nor travel document. The corrections must be made on both copies of the CoPR by \nplacing an asterisk beside the data error and noting the correction in the remarks \nsection of the form. Any corrections made must also be reflected in GCMS.\n57 \n \n \ncheck the information on sex and marital status, particularly when dealing with \ncommon-law relationships and accompanying family members; \n \nverify their biometrics for those not verified at PIK; \n \nconfirm that the applicant intends to establish permanent residence in Canada;  \n \nconfirm that the applicant is not inadmissible under A39;  \no \nPersons who do not need to provide proof of funds are those who: \n \nhave been sponsored;  \n \nhave been issued visas as government-assisted refugees; \n \napplied under the Canadian Experience Class; or \n \nare authorized to work in Canada and have a valid job offer, even if \nthey applied under the Federal Skilled Worker Program or the Federal \nSkilled Trades Program.  \no \nThose who need to provide proof of funds to meet the minimum requirements \nare those who: \n \napplied under the Federal Skilled Worker Program and \n \napplied under the Federal Skilled Trades Program \no \nFor those immigrating to the province of Quebec, the capacity for financial \nself-sufficiency is lower. \n \nassess that the applicant and family members are not inadmissible for any other \nIRPA inadmissibility; and \n \ncollect biometrics only from select resettled refugees when BIO-CDA is printed in \nthe remarks section \no \nRefer to Shift briefing bulletins 2019-HQ-AC-06-04 and 2021-HQ-AC-03-31 \nfor more information. \nThe examining BSO should then: \n \nComplete the following fields on both copies of the CoPR using a black pen: \no \nBecame PR at: The officer must write the location of where PR status is granted \n(either a POE or an inland IRCC office). \no \nBecame PR on: The officer must write the date that PR status is granted. \no \nFlight no.: BSO must write which flight the client arrived on or if it was at a land \nborder. \no \nConditions: Have the client write their initials beside any imposed conditions. \no \nHave you ever been charged/convicted of a crime or offence; refused \nadmission to Canada or required to leave Canada?: The client must write \n“yes” or “no” as well as their initials. If the client is a minor, the answer should \nbe “N/A”. \no \nDependent(s) information: The client must write “yes” or “no” as well as their \ninitials. If the answer is yes, the dependent’s information must be added only if \nthey have been included in the application and they have been examined. \no \nSignature: Have the client sign and date. \no \nOfficer signature: BSO must sign with a complete signature, not just initials or \nbadge number. Add the date. \n \nComplete and confirm the CoPR in GCMS following one of the instructions on the \nCBSA Wiki: \no \nBecome PR with Conditions \no \nBecome PR without Conditions \n \nUpdate the client’s complete address in Canada in GCMS, including the postal code.\n58 \n \n \nIf an address is already indicated on the CoPR, the officer must check with the client \nto ensure that it is still accurate and that the client will be able to receive \ncorrespondence at that address.  \n \nIf they have no address, advise the client that they have 180 days to provide IRCC \nwith their address as per R58(1). BSOs should provide them the IMM 5456B Address \nNotification – Permanent Resident Card form and inform the client to send it to IRCC \nvia one of the methods mentioned on the form or the client may update their \naddress in Canada by accessing the online Change my Address tool. \n \nStamp the travel or identity document as per the stamping policy. \n \nCounsel the client that they will receive their PR card in approximately two – three \nmonths and that if they have not received it within four months they should contact \nthe IRCC Call Centre at 1-888-242-2100. \n \nGive the new PR the second copy and keep the copy with the photograph. \n \nOnce the CoPR has been completed and confirmed in GCMS, the BSO will counsel the \nPR as to their rights and obligations under IRPA and IRPR. See section 12.14 of this \nmanual for more information. \n \nPersons who wish to have their PR card issued in a name that is different from what appears \non the CoPR or passport must submit a formal request to the OSC, using the Guide for this \npurpose [IMM 5218E] and the IMM 1436 form Request to Amend Valid Temporary Resident \nDocuments or Information Contained in the Confirmation of Permanent Residence.  \n \nApplicants should not apply for an amendment to reflect the new name of an adopted child. \nWhen an application for Canadian citizenship is submitted, IRCC will be able to issue the \ncitizenship certificate with the new name, provided they have appropriate supporting \ndocuments. \nPhotographs \nThere are specific requirements for the PR photograph: \n \nThe background must be white (use screens provided with camera to take \nphotographs). \n \nThere must not be any objects in the background. \n \nThe photograph should show the full front view of the person with the head and \nshoulders centred in the photograph. \n \nThere must be no staples, stamps, pen marks, holes or tape on the photograph. \n \nEyeglasses in photos are acceptable if they are a normal feature of a person’s \nappearance, as long as the glasses do not hide the eyes. \n \nHead coverings on photographs, other than those worn for religious reasons, are not \nacceptable. \n \nTorn photos are not acceptable. \nSignatures \n \nChildren 14 years of age and over must sign their own form. \n \nA parent or legal guardian must sign for children under the age of 14, using their \nown name and not the child’s name. \n \nThe signature must match the name on the form except in the case of a child under \nthe age of 14 whose parent or legal guardian has signed on their behalf.\n59 \n \n \nIf the person is illiterate or cannot make a mark (e.g. an X) for a physical reason, a \nthumbprint should be placed on the form. \nFor further details on how to properly process a CoPR, see IRCC’s Operational Bulletin 545. \n12.6 Changes in marital and family status \nR51 requires a FN who has been issued a PR visa/CoPR to advise an officer if their marital \nstatus has changed since the visa/CoPR was issued.  \nA report under A44(1) for A41(a) for R51 is not necessary, if the non-declaration of a \nmarriage or common-law relationship to the visa officer does not affect the grant of \npermanent residence to the person in the following cases: \n \nIn the case of refugees and protected persons, a BSO should grant PR status to \nthese classes of persons and provide counselling regarding the sponsorship of a \nspouse or common-law partner. \n \nA FN who marries their sponsor after the visa/CoPR is issued but before the grant of \npermanent residence. This change in circumstance is not material to admissibility. \nThe BSO should assume the truthfulness of voluntary statements relating to marital status \nand proceed as though the person seeking to become a PR were married, whether or not \nthere is documentary proof of the marital status. The BSO should usually defer the \nexamination pursuant to A23 in order to consult the visa office and obtain more information \nand evidence about the person’s marital status. In some cases, the BSO may ask the visa \nofficer to interview a non-accompanying spouse or common-law partner outside Canada to \ndetermine if they meet the requirements of the Act and Regulations and can be issued a PR \nvisa/CoPR. \nThe procedure for authorizing PR status to the person seeking to become a PR and the \nspouse will vary from case to case, depending on the applicant’s and the spouse’s particular \ncircumstances. The BSO should provide a full case summary to accompany the file, so that \nthe receiving inland IRCC office can follow up appropriately.  \nThe BSO should bear in mind that the applicants’ and their family members’ medical \nexamination, security check and travel document may need to be updated while the spouse \nor common-law partner is being examined and before permanent residence can be granted. \nIf, after the investigation, there is sufficient evidence to proceed with enforcement action, a \nBSO may write the appropriate A44(1) report against the person seeking to become a PR as \nwell as an accompanying spouse or common-law partner. \n12.7 Common-law partners \nR1(1) states the following: \ncommon-law partner means, in relation to a person, an individual who is \ncohabiting with the person in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a \nperiod of at least one year.\n60 \n \nR1(2) states the following: \n“…, an individual who has been in a conjugal relationship with a person for at least \none year but is unable to cohabit with the person, due to persecution or any form of \npenal control, shall be considered a common-law partner of the person.” \nTact and diplomacy should be exercised when conducting an interview about personal \nrelationships as questions could be embarrassing to both BSO and client.  \nEvery person seeking to become a PR should be asked if their marital or common-law status \nhas changed to include either a spouse or common-law partner. \n12.8 Dependent children with common-law partners \nWhen verifying the marital status or common-law partnership status of dependent children \nduring an examination, the situation may arise whereby a dependent child is unmarried, but \nmay have a common-law partner. If so, as in the case of a married dependent child, the \nchild is no longer a dependent according to the established definition (R2). Children under \n22 years of age in married and common-law relationships are no longer dependent children.  \nA dependent who is single, divorced or widowed, whose marriage has been annulled or who \nis no longer in a common-law relationship at the time of the initial receipt of the application \nis considered to meet the definition of a dependent child and must continue to meet the \ndefinition of a dependent child for the duration of processing. \n12.9 Procedure for dealing with children whose marital or family status \nhas changed \nA BSO at Immigration Secondary who determines that the marital status of a dependent \nchild has changed should do the following: \n \nDetermine whether, despite the change in marital or common-law status, the person \nis still considered a dependant: \no \n22 years of age or older;  \no \nhave depended substantially on the financial support of the parent since \nbefore the age of 22; and  \no \nbe unable to support themselves financially due to a physical or mental \ncondition. It is the financial dependency that must have been ongoing since \nbefore the age of 22. It is not necessary for the physical or mental condition \nto have existed before the age of 22.  \n \nIf so, the BSO should grant PR status.  \n \nIf not, and the consequence of a change in marital status or common-law \npartnership status cannot be readily determined, the BSO should defer the \nexamination pursuant to A23. \n \nCreate an Examination in GCMS and add corresponding details in it’s Notes tab \nwithout delay and update the person’s complete address and telephone number on \ntheir GCMS Client record. \n \nSend an email to the visa office that issued the PR visa/CoPR explaining the case \ndetails, including the visa office B file number, GCMS identification number and case \ninformation.\n61 \n \n12.10 Medical surveillance \nInactive pulmonary tuberculosis is the only medical condition for which medical surveillance \nis currently required. Code S2.02 refers to inactive pulmonary tuberculosis and code S2.02U \nrefers to complex inactive pulmonary tuberculosis and/or other complex, non-infectious \ntuberculosis. \nApplicants who have been issued a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (CoPR)  \n[IMM 5688] have already had their immigration medical examination (IME) abroad. If \nfollow-up medical surveillance is required, this condition will appear on the CoPR and is \nimposed by the visa officer who completes a Medical Surveillance Undertaking form \n[IMM 0535B] in GCMS.  \nIt is no longer required for the BSO to complete and fax this form to the Public Health \nLiaison Unit at IRCC. Once the BSO changes the CoPR status in GCMS to “confirmed”, the \ninformation is automatically sent to the Public Health Liaison Unit. It is important that the \nPR’s Canadian residential address and phone number or at minimum, their email address, \nbe in GCMS so that Public Health can contact them. The officer shall counsel the applicant \nconcerning the conditions imposed and the need to contact the Public Health Liaison Unit by \nemail (IRCC.MHBSurveillance-SurveillanceDGMS.IRCC@cic.gc.ca) with an address as soon \nas one has been established, if applicable. It is no longer necessary for the applicant to \ncontact Public Health as indicated on older versions of the IMM 0535B. If the applicant has \nany questions, they can contact IRCC’s Public Health Liaison Unit directly at the \naforementioned email address. Also, there is a new public webpage on medical surveillance \nfor applicants which they can go to. \nFor more information on medical surveillance see OP 15 Medical Surveillance and \nNotifications, the Wiki for GCMS step-by-step or contact the Public Health Liaison Unit \ndirectly. \n12.11 Family members arriving before the principal applicant \nOccasionally, a BSO at Immigration Secondary will encounter a family member (coded DEP \non the CoPR) that arrives to be granted PR status before the principal applicant (coded PA \non the CoPR). R51(b) requires a PR visa/CoPR holder to establish that they and their family \nmembers, whether accompanying or not, meet the requirements of the Act and Regulations. \nFor a family member to meet these requirements, it is usually incumbent on the principal \napplicant being admissible at the POE.  \nA BSO encountering this situation should obtain the following information from the \ndependent: \n \nwhy the dependent is preceding the principal applicant (e.g., to seek accommodation \nor employment, lack of a seat on the aircraft carrying the principal applicant); \n \nwhen the principal applicant is due to arrive; and \n \nthe person’s means of support.  \nThe BSO should complete the verification process but should not grant PR status to the \ndependent. If the person has a valid PR visa/CoPR and the BSO is satisfied that the principal\n62 \n \napplicant intends to come to Canada, the BSO may wish to defer the examination pursuant \nto A23 in order to wait until the principal applicant arrives so they may be examined.  \nThe BSO should enter the information into the Notes tab of the application in GCMS without \ndelay, which indicates that the granting of permanent residence has been deferred pending \nthe arrival of the principal applicant.  \n12.12 Arrival of the principal applicant prior to family members \nA principal applicant may have decided to proceed to Canada in order to commence \nemployment or to confirm that adequate settlement arrangements, such as accommodation \nand educational facilities exist prior to the arrival of their dependents. A BSO at Immigration \nSecondary must confirm that the dependents meet the requirements of the Act and its \nRegulations before granting PR status to the principal applicant. In most instances, the BSO \ncan assume that persons listed as dependents on the principal applicant’s CoPR meet the \nrequirements of the Act and Regulations and can grant PR status to the principal applicant.  \n12.13 Expired or cancelled PR visa / CoPR \nA person who presents an expired or cancelled PR visa and/or CoPR cannot be authorized to \nenter Canada as a PR. The person may be reportable under A41 and R6 for non-compliance \nwith the Regulations because a FN may not enter Canada to remain on a permanent basis \nwithout first obtaining a PR visa/CoPR.  \nIf the examination of a holder of a valid PR visa/CoPR is deferred pursuant to A23, the \nperson may be granted permanent residence at a later date after the expiration of their \nvisa/CoPR provided they initially appeared for examination and presented their PR \nvisa/CoPR within its period of validity.  \n12.14 Counselling new PRs \nThe BSO at Immigration Secondary should counsel each new PR on the following matters: \n \nthe conditions of PR status that have been imposed and how to comply with the \nconditions; \n \nthe residency obligation; \n \nthe procedure for obtaining a PR card; \n \nthe procedure for obtaining a social insurance number via Service Canada; and  \n \nthe procedure for applying for provincial health coverage.  \n13 Examination of FNs at POEs \nFNs may be authorized to enter Canada. A22(1) provides that: \nA FN becomes a temporary resident if an officer is satisfied that the FN has applied \nfor that status, has met the obligations set out in A20(1)(b), is not inadmissible and \nis not the subject of a declaration made under 22.1(1).\n63 \n \nTemporary residents include: visitors, students, workers, and temporary resident permit \nholders. \n13.1 Visa requirements for temporary residents \nA Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) is a counterfoil document issued by a visa officer that is \nplaced in a person’s passport. Every citizen from a TRV required country who is approved \nfor travel to Canada will be issued a TRV (IMM1346B). See section 13.2 below for \nexemptions to this requirement. \nA TRV indicates that the FN has been pre-screened by a visa officer and that this officer was \nsatisfied that the visa holder met the requirements for entry into Canada at the time of the \nissuance of the visa. Holding a TRV does not guarantee that the FN will be authorized entry \ninto Canada. \nA11(1) requires FNs to apply for a visa before entering Canada. R7 also provides that a FN \nmay not enter Canada to remain on a temporary basis without first obtaining a TRV.  \n13.2 Exemptions from a visa requirement \nR7(2) exempts certain FNs from the requirement to obtain a visa. These include: \n \nFNs who hold a TRP issued under A24(1); \n \nFNs who are authorized under the Act or its Regulations to re-enter Canada to \nremain in Canada;  \n \na citizen of Romania who is seeking to enter Canada by air and who obtained an eTA \nbefore December 1, 2017; and  \n \nFNs exempt under R190. \nSee R190 for a complete list of temporary resident visa exemptions for FNs. This section \nincludes: \n \nvisa-exemptions by nationality [R190(1)]; \n \nother document holders who are exempt from the temporary resident visa \nrequirement [R190(2)]; \n \nspecial categories of persons who are temporary resident visa exempt [R190(3)]; \n \npersons entering Canada who are or to become crew members of a means of \ntransportation other than a vessel [R190(3)(a)(i)]; \n \nFNs in transit for refuelling destined to or originating from the US [R190(3)(b)]; \n \nFN on a flight that makes an unscheduled stop in Canada due to an emergency or \nother unforeseen circumstances [R190(3)(b.1)]; \n \nmembers of the Transit Without Visa Program (TWOV) and the China Transit \nProgram (CTP) [R190(3)(c)] (for more information, refer to the Transit Without \nVisa/China Transit Program Standard Operating Procedures on Atlas); \n \nmembers of armed forces coming to carry out official duties under of the Visiting \nForces Act [R190(3)(d)] and in possession of travel or military orders; \n \npersons seeking re-entry into Canada, after visiting only the U.S. or St. Pierre and \nMiquelon, within the authorized period of stay granted upon initial entry into Canada \nor extension to this period [R190(3)(f)] (see section 13.3 below); \n \ntemporary residents seeking re-entry to Canada from the U.S. or St. Pierre and \nMiquelon, after applying to renew their status, remain under their original status\n64 \n \nuntil a decision is made and they are notified [R183(5)]. These people are \nconsidered to have maintained status; \n \npersons conducting inspections on flight operation procedures or cabin safety on \ncommercial air carriers [R190(3)(g)]. Note : This visa exemption does not apply to \nIn Flight Security Officers (IFSO), also known as air marshals. They are not to be \nconsidered as members of a crew; or \n \nPersons participating as an accredited representative or adviser to an aviation \naccident or incident investigation conducted under the Canadian Transportation \nAccident Investigation and Safety Board Act, and have valid documentation to that \neffect [R190(3)(h)]. \nNote: Under the Regulations, the definition of the United States includes Puerto Rico. \n13.3 Re-entry into Canada without a visa \nFNs who require a temporary resident visa and who seek to re-enter Canada must be in \npossession of a multiple-entry TRV unless: \n \nsince leaving Canada after being authorized to enter as a temporary resident, they \nhave only visited the U.S. or St. Pierre and Miquelon, and are returning to Canada \nbefore the end of the period initially authorized by a BSO for their stay or any \nextension to it.[R190(3)(f)]; \n \nthey have only visited the U.S. or St. Pierre and Miquelon and they are in possession \nof a valid visitor record (VR), WP, SP, or a TRP (authorizing re-entry) and are \nreturning within the initial period authorized by a BSO, [R190(3)(f)]; \n \nthey are seeking entry on maintained status. A temporary resident with maintained \nstatus that leaves Canada is exempt from obtaining a temporary resident visa \npursuant to R190(3)(f) if they are returning from a visit solely to the United States \nor St. Pierre and Miquelon. Their status as a temporary resident is extended until a \ndecision is made and they are notified in accordance with R183(5). They are not \nauthorized to work or study in Canada as they did not remain in Canada as per \nR186(u) and R189 until their application for a renewal on their WP or SP has been \napproved. To emphasize these conditions, BSOs may consider documenting these \nFNs on a VR. For guidelines on when to issue a VR see section 13.24 below. \nNote: Under the Regulations, the definition of the United States includes Puerto Rico. \nThese FNs must comply with all other entry requirements. If they visit any country other \nthan those stated above, they are not visa-exempt under R190(3)(f).  \nFurthermore, visa-required FNs may attempt to use the provision in 190(3)(f) to bypass the \nappropriate procedures for extending their TR status in Canada (e.g. to avoid obtaining a \nnew visa). Officers are reminded that if they do not place a new stamp with a specified \nvalidity date the FN automatically receives a 6 months authorized period of stay as per \nR183(2) on every entry. Therefore, officers should consider limiting the authorization to the \ninitial entry validity date by writing that date under a new stamp. However, an officer can \nauthorize the FN into Canada for a 6 month period if they believe the FN is admissible and \nwill comply with the conditions of their entry. \nRegarding work, study, visitor and TRP applications, it should be noted that the CBSA does \nnot have the authority to renew or extend these permits at the POE, but will assess such\n65 \n \nrequests as a completely new application, as well as the individual’s admissibility to \nCanada. Individuals seeking entry to Canada at a POE who currently have a valid TR status \nmay be admitted to Canada on the basis of their existing permit and instructed to apply to \nIRCC in Canada for an extension or renewal. \n13.4 Examples of situations applying R190(3)(f)  \n \nA FN in possession of a TRV valid for one year, who is subsequently issued a four-\nyear SP at a POE, may leave and return to Canada after the expiry of the visa as \nlong as they have only visited the U.S. or St. Pierre and Miquelon and the SP is still \nvalid. \n \nA FN in possession of a single-entry TRV may leave and return to Canada without the \nissuance of a new or multiple-entry visa as long as they return to Canada within the \ninitial period (or any extensions) authorized and have only visited the U.S. or St. \nPierre and Miquelon.  \n \nPursuant to R190(3)(f) a FN who is from a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) required \ncountry, who has been admitted to Canada as a temporary resident and is re-\nentering Canada from the U.S. or St. Pierre and Miquelon, before the expiry of the \nperiod initially authorized for their stay, is exempt from the requirement to obtain a \nTRV. R198(1) allows a person who is exempt from the requirement to obtain a TRV \nto apply for a WP at the POE. Taken together R190(3)(f) and R198(1) allow for a FN \nto apply for the first or subsequent WP at a POE as long as the FN has been initially \nauthorized to enter Canada as a temporary resident and returns to Canada from the \nU.S. or St. Pierre and Miquelon by the end of the period initially authorized for their \nstay and any extension to it. \n13.5 Foreign representatives posted to Canada \nWhether from a visa-exempt country or visa-required one, foreign representatives and their \nfamily members seeking entry into Canada to be accredited (i.e., to take up posting) are \nrequired to apply for a TRV based on instructions devised by IRCC in consultation with \nGlobal Affairs Canada’s Office of Protocol (XDC); related applications are processed based \non operational guidance, in consultation with XDC.  \nForeign representatives and their family members who subsequently enter Canada and \nreceive/maintain a valid diplomatic acceptance, a consular acceptance, or an official \nacceptance issued by the Chief of Protocol of Canada are regarded as properly accredited \nand exempt from obtaining a TRV or an eTA as per R190(2)(a) and R7.1(3)(c). \nIf a BSO has concerns regarding incoming and properly accredited foreign representatives \nand family members they should contact IRCC’s Case Management Branch at: \nIRCC.CMBImmigrationCaseAdvice-ConseilCasImmigrationDGRC.IRCC@cic.gc.ca and in cc \nadd xdc-ircc@international.gc.ca.  \nFor urgent cases, the BSO may contact the IRCC Liaison Unit at the Office of Protocol at \n613-992-0889. The IRCC Liaison Unit is available for urgent cases during regular business \nhours, Monday to Friday. For after-hours service, contact the Operations Officer at 613-944-\n1294.On the first arrival in Canada of a foreign representative or family member whose \npassport bears a D-1 or O-1 visa counterfoil or a single entry counterfoil-less visa, the BSO \nat the PIL should stamp the passport giving them status in Canada for six months. During \nthe six-month period, the official’s embassy or consulate will forward their passport to the\n66 \n \nDiplomatic Corps Services Division, Office of Protocol, Global Affairs Canada. The Office of \nProtocol will issue a diplomatic (D), consular (C), official (J) or international (I) acceptance, \nwhich indicates that the person is accredited to Canada and entitled to remain in Canada for \nthe duration of their official status.  \nDependent children of diplomats, consular officers, representatives or officials who are \nunder 19 years of age and considered to be “members of the family forming part of the \nhousehold” will be issued acceptances. Children over 19 years of age will be issued \nacceptances only if they are registered as full-time students at a Canadian Designated \nLearning Institution (DLI). After 25 years of age, family members are no longer eligible to \nreceive official acceptances, and must change their official status under Foreign Missions \nand International Organizations Act (FMIOA) to a non-official temporary resident status \nunder IRPA. \nFor more information, see procedures related to diplomatic and official visas. \n13.6 Affirmations for visas \nAn Affirmation for Visa form [IMM 1281B] is to be used as a document in lieu of a passport \ninvolving nationals of countries not recognized by Canada. When a person presents an \nIMM 1281B form, a BSO at Immigration Secondary must apply the port stamp in the lower \nright corner of the visa (partly on the visa, partly on the page).  \n13.7 U.S. government officials \nThe following official U.S. government personnel assigned to temporary postings in Canada \nare not issued diplomatic or official acceptances in Canada: \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officers; \n \nU.S. Customs officers; \n \nInternational Joint Commission employees; and \n \nInspectors with the Federal Grain Inspection Service of the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture and other U.S. government officials in possession of \nofficial U.S. government passports and assigned to temporary postings in Canada. \nU.S. government personnel arriving in Canada for the first time will be issued a fee exempt \nWP, on presentation of a “letter of introduction” from the appropriate agency, identifying the \nassignment, its location and the number of years the employee will be assigned in Canada. \nFor more information on the documentation of U.S. government employees, refer to United \nStates government personnel on IRCC’s Connexion page, which deals with temporary \nforeign workers applications at POEs. \n \n13.8 Courtesy visas \nVisa officers may issue courtesy visas to persons who, although not entitled to diplomatic \nprivileges and immunities, warrant a visa to facilitate their entry because of their position or \nbecause their reason for coming to Canada is considered sufficiently important.\n67 \n \nCourtesy visas may be issued to: \n \npersons of diplomatic rank coming to Canada for tourism purposes; \n \nmembers of the International Air Transport Association (IATA); \n \nmembers of a trade mission visiting Canada; and \n \nwell-known visiting professors coming to Canada to attend conferences.  \nCourtesy visas may be issued in any type of passport to FNs who require visas or who are \nnormally visa-exempt. The visa should draw a BSO’s attention to the fact that the individual \nis considered by the IRCC visa office to warrant particularly expeditious and courteous \ntreatment at the POE. Such FNs are subject to normal documentation requirements and are \nnot exempt from regular examination procedures. \n13.9 Parents and Grandparents Extended Stay Temporary Resident \nVisa (Super Visa) \nEligible parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and PRs may be issued a multiple-\nentry TRV coded PG-1 for up to 10 years or for visa-exempt FNs, a letter of introduction will \nbe issued for five (5) years or until passport expiry. The status period of such eligible \npersons will be for two (2) years on each entry to Canada. These travellers can be admitted \nat the PIL however, should they be referred to Immigration Secondary, BSOs should verify \nthat the super visa holder or the holder of a super visa letter of introduction has valid \nmedical insurance, continues to meet the requirements of the super visa and is not \ninadmissible. \nThe BSO will then stamp the super visa holder’s passport, but no handwritten date is \nrequired. Should the BSO authorize a period of stay of less than 2 years, a VR should be \nissued to the client with clear notes indicating the reason why the period of stay was \nshortened. \nSome travellers with a PG-1 TRV may also be subject to medical surveillance.  \nBSOs should follow the same procedure for TRs as for PRs. Refer to section 12.10 of this \nmanual for detailed procedures.  \n13.10 Expired temporary resident visas \nA person seeking to enter Canada with an expired temporary resident visa is inadmissible \nand should be reported pursuant to A41(a) for A20(1)(b). \n13.11 Notification to visa office if a visa holder is refused entry \nA BSO at Immigration Secondary who is of the opinion a FN who holds a TRV or a TRP is \ninadmissible should send full details of the refusal by email to the issuing visa office. This \nallows the visa office to review the decision to issue the visa and to deal with future \nrepresentations that the person may make to the visa office.\n68 \n \nThe BSO must put the phrase: “As requested: ENF 4” in the subject line and include the \nfollowing information in the following order: \n(a) the name and nationality of the subject of the A44(1) report; or a person allowed \nto withdraw their application; \n(b) the person’s date and place of birth; \n(c) the visa or permit number, date and office of issue; \n(d) the date and POE where the person sought to enter Canada; \n(e) the reason for refusal, using the code letter for the reason for refusal: \nA: seeking permanent residence, \nB: claims Convention refugee status, \nC: intends to seek or take employment, \nD: intends to follow a course of study, \nE: has insufficient funds to maintain themselves and their family members, \nF: medical inadmissibility, \nG: criminal inadmissibility, \nH: expired temporary resident’s visa, or \nI: other; \n(f) the name and file number of the office responsible for follow-up enforcement \naction, if the office differs from the POE; and \n(g) the visa office file number (some visa offices include the number on the visa). \nThe BSO should not provide any other details in the email report. This procedure allows the \nBSO to transmit the report as an unclassified message. \nIf the reason for refusal was code “I” (other), the officer should send a report by mail to the \nissuing visa office giving further details of the reason for the refusal.  \nThis reporting system gives IRCC visa offices immediate feedback on their decisions for \nissuing temporary resident visas (TRVs) and assists in monitoring the effectiveness of the \nTRV program. \n13.12 Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) and eTA Expansion (eTA-X) \nAn eTA is an entry requirement for visa-exempt FNs travelling to or transiting through \nCanada by air. U.S citizens and U.S. lawful permanent residents (USLPR) are some of the \nexempted populations from this requirement. An eTA is a paperless document electronically \nlinked to a traveller’s passport that must be obtained prior to travelling to or through \nCanada by air. \nR7.1(1) requires all FNs from visa-exempt countries to obtain an eTA before entering \nCanada.\n69 \n \nR7.01 defines which citizens, from visa-required countries, are eligible for an eTA when \ntravelling to Canada by air under the eTA-X program. The eligibility criteria are: \n \nHave held a Canadian TRV in the preceding 10 years; or \n \nCurrently hold a valid U.S. non-immigrant visa (NIV). \nAn eTA issued pursuant to the eTA expansion provisions of the IRPR has the same legal \nauthority, except that the eligibility criteria differs. \nBSOs should be aware that the TRV exemption for \"contiguous territory\", R190(3)(f) may \napply to eTA–X clients who were authorized entry at an air POE and subsequently departed \nCanada for a visit solely to the US or St-Pierre and Miquelon and then returned to Canada \nvia any mode within the period initially authorized for their visit. \n13.13 eTA exemptions \nR7.1(3) states that select individuals are exempt from the eTA requirement, including: \n \nQueen Elizabeth II and members of the Royal Family; \n \nholders of valid TRVs; \n \ncitizens of the United States or a person who has been lawfully admitted to the US \nfor permanent residence (USLPR); \n \naccredited diplomats, consular and officials in Canada; \n \nselect civil aviation personnel (flight crew, flight safety advisors, accident \ninvestigators); \n \nFrench citizens who are residents of St. Pierre and Miquelon arriving from St. Pierre \nand Miquelon; \n \nforeign military personnel carrying out duties under the Visiting Forces Act; \n \nFNs seeking re-entry directly from the US or Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon with prior \nstatus in Canada; \n \nFNs holding a valid U.S. document travelling to and from the U.S. who are \npassengers on a flight stopping in Canada for the sole purpose of refuelling; \n \nFNs transiting Canada under the TWOV or the CTP; \n \nFNs onboard flights diverted to Canada for medical, mechanical, or other emergency \nreasons. \n13.14 eTA validity and cancellation \nAn eTA will be valid for up to five years or until the passport expires, whichever comes first. \nA visitor may travel to Canada repeatedly without having to apply for another eTA, so long \nas their original eTA remains valid. \nUnlike a TRV, BSOs at the POE may cancel an eTA and eTA-X when the holder may become \nineligible to possess one. The CBSA’s OB PRG-2017-41 describes when a BSO may cancel \nan eTA and eTA-X if at least one of the following conditions are met: \n \nthey are the subject of a declaration made under A22.1(1); \n \nthey were issued a TRP under A24(1); \n \nthey are the subject of a report prepared under A44(1); \n \nthey are the subject of a removal order made under A44(2) or A45(d);\n70 \n \n \nthey withdrew their application to enter Canada under R42(1); \n \nthey were refused a temporary resident visa because they did not meet the \nrequirement set out in R179(b); \n \nthey were refused a WP because they did not meet the requirement set out in \nR200(1)(b); \n \nthey were refused a SP because they did not meet the requirement set out in \nR216(1)(b); or \n \nin the case of a FN referred to in R7.01(1), it is established that, on the day on which \nthey made their application for an eTA-X, they did not meet either of the conditions \nset out in R7.01(2)(a) and (b). \nPlease refer to the Wiki page for step-by-step instructions on how to cancel an eTA in GCMS \nas well as the comments to be inserted in the eTA cancellation Correspondence tab. \n13.15 Document requirements for FNs \nR52(1) provides that a FN seeking to become a temporary resident of Canada must possess \na valid passport, identity or travel document. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure \nadequate identification of the FN and to guarantee that person’s re-entry either into the \ncountry that issued the passport, identity or travel document or into another country.  \nR52(1) provides a list of acceptable passports or travel documents for FNs seeking to enter \nCanada as temporary residents. \nVisa officers should ensure that a travel document is acceptable for travel to Canada before \nissuing a visa. A CBSA officer can normally assume that a document containing an authentic \nvisa is acceptable for travel to Canada, unless there is some reason to question its \nacceptability.  \n13.16 Passport and travel document exceptions \nR52(2) provides a list of persons who are exempt from the requirement to have a passport \nor travel document to enter Canada as temporary residents:  \n \nU.S. citizens; \n \nPermanent residents of the U.S. seeking to enter Canada from the United States or \nSt. Pierre and Miquelon. Note that U.S. Permanent Resident Cards are only \nacceptable upon presentation on contiguous territory and not valid for international \nflights from outside Canada unless accompanied by a valid and subsisting passport \nor travel document; \n \nResidents of Greenland seeking to enter Canada from Greenland; \n \nCitizens of France residing in St. Pierre and Miquelon seeking to enter Canada from \nSt. Pierre and Miquelon; \n \nMilitary personnel seeking to enter Canada under the Visiting Forces Act; \n \nPersons seeking to enter as or in order to become air crew members and who hold \nan airline flight crew licence or crew member certificate issued in accordance with \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) specifications; and \n \nPersons seeking to enter Canada as crew members who hold a seafarer’s identity \ndocument and are crew members of the vessel that carries them to Canada.\n71 \n \n13.17 Examining passports \nThe purpose of examining a passport is to verify information that has been provided by the \nholder or that appears on any immigration document issued to the person. A BSO should \nexamine each passport to confirm the following: \n \nthe name of the holder; \n \nthe date of birth of the holder; \n \nother data such as the person’s physical description, place of birth, marital status \nand profession; \n \nthe country of citizenship; \n \nthe photograph of the holder; \n \nthe date of expiry; and  \n \nvisa pages (to determine previous trips to Canada or other recent trips or visa \nrefusal stamps, typically found on the last page that may be relevant to the overall \nexamination of the person). \nCBSA’s National Document Centre (NDC) contributes to helping prevent the movement of \nunlawful people across the border through the detection and analysis of document and \nidentity fraud at POEs through collaboration with national and international partners on the \nintegrity of their travel and identity documents and issuance processes. The NDC acts as a \ncenter of expertise for the CBSA and IRCC in the analysis of travel and identity document \nfraud. On their page on Atlas, you can find Document alerts, Document bulletins and \nDocument communiqués.  \nBSOs also have access to EDISON TD, a database which allows users to compare doubtful \nor unknown travel documents with high definition images of authentic ones. Most often, the \ndocuments shown are specimens, that is, documents provided by the issuing authority for \ncomparative analysis purposes. \nFor more information, please consult section 13 of ENF 32, Passports and Travel \nDocuments. \n13.18 Valid visas in expired passports \nVisa officers will not put a visa in an expired document and will not issue a visa for a period \nsurpassing the expiry date of the passport or travel document. Occasionally, documents \ncontaining valid visas are cancelled or replaced. If a valid visa inside an expired document is \npresented at the POE along with a valid passport or travel document, the visa is considered \nvalid. \n13.19 Evidence of U.S. citizenship \nThe following documents may be satisfactory evidence of U.S. citizenship: \n \nU.S. passports, U.S. passport cards, and Certificates of Citizenship and Naturalization \nare considered prima facie evidence and are acceptable proof of U.S. citizenship. \n \nA U.S. birth certificate, when accompanied by another document bearing a picture of \nthe holder, is considered an indicator and may be an acceptable proof of U.S. \ncitizenship.\n72 \n \nA U.S. military identification card, although a good supporting document, is not prima facie \nevidence of U.S. citizenship. The U.S. military accepts recruits who are not U.S. citizens. \nSometimes, a verbal declaration may be sufficient to satisfy a BSO that a person is a U.S. \ncitizen. For example, driver’s licenses, health cards, U.S. Voter’s Registration card, school \nrecords, credit cards are not prima facie evidence of citizenship, but they are often used \nalong with a verbal declaration to satisfy the BSO of U.S. citizenship. In other \ncircumstances, the BSO may require better documentary evidence for persons claiming to \nbe U.S. citizens. BSOs should also familiarize themselves with the Enhanced Drivers \nLicence/Enhanced Identification Cards as well as the trusted traveller cards, such as FAST, \nNEXUS, CANPASS and the U.S. SENTRI card. \nIndigenous identity documents which are recognized by the Government of the United \nStates may assist the examining officer in reaching a determination of the person’s US \ncitizenship and country of residence. These documents are the US Enhanced Tribal Card \n(ETC) and I-872 American Indian Card. \nTo assist the travel industry, airlines and travel agents have been supplied with the \nfollowing information: \n \na U.S. passport constitutes the best form of identification for U.S. citizens travelling \nto Canada; and  \n \nU.S. citizens may travel to Canada without passports if they have other means of \nestablishing their citizenship, such as a U.S. birth certificate or naturalization papers.  \n13.20 Conditions imposed on temporary residents \nR183(1) provides for the following general conditions that are automatically imposed on all \ntemporary residents:  \n \nto leave Canada by the end of their authorized period of stay; \n \nto not work, unless they have been issued a WP or are exempt from the requirement \nto obtain a WP pursuant to R186 and/or R187;  \n \nto not study, unless they have been issued a SP or are exempt from the requirement \nto obtain a SP pursuant to R188 and/or R189; and \n \nto comply with all requirements imposed by an order or regulation made under the \nEmergencies Act or the Quarantine Act. \nA BSO does not need to document these conditions for every person authorized to enter \nCanada as a temporary resident as they are automatically imposed. However, if the BSO \nbelieves that a document is necessary as a control measure or as an aid in counselling the \nperson regarding the conditions of their entry, they may generate a VR and explain in the \nNotes tab, without delay, why a VR was issued. \n13.21 Duration of temporary resident status \nR183(2) states that the period authorized for the stay of a temporary resident is six months \nor any other period that an officer imposes based on the following criteria: \n \nthe temporary resident’s means of support in Canada;\n73 \n \n \nthe period for which the temporary resident applies to stay; and \n \nthe expiry of the temporary resident’s passport or other travel document. \n13.22 Six-month entry \nIn most cases, a BSO should routinely authorize entry for a period of six months to a FN \nrequesting entry as a temporary resident, even when the person requests entry for a very \nbrief period. Six months is adequate for most purposes of travel and preclude the need for \nthe person to request an extension. \nThe BSO should also stamp the foreign national’s passport or travel document, inscribe a \ndate of expiry based on a calculation of six months from the date of entry and initial the \nnotation. Please refer to the CBSA Stamp Policy for more information on annotating a travel \ndocument. The BSO should counsel the FN on the need to comply with general obligations \nfor the visit and of any extension, should one become necessary. \nIn instances where the principal applicant of the family is traveling with their family \nmembers, BSOs should generally authorize entry to all members of the family for the same \nlength of time as indicated on the WP or SP of the principal applicant.  \n13.23 Entry for more or less than six months \nBased on the information presented during an examination, a BSO at Immigration \nSecondary may decide to limit a temporary resident’s stay to less than six months despite \nthe length of time requested by the foreign national. If requested by the applicant and the \nBSO is satisfied that the FN is a temporary resident, is able to support themselves and \naccompanying family members financially, and is not inadmissible for reasons of health or \nsecurity, the granting of entry for more than six months may be considered. \nIn no case should the BSO impose a period of time for a temporary resident’s stay greater \nthan the validity of the foreign national’s passport or travel document. This will not be \napplicable to U.S. citizens and other FNs exempted under R52(2) from the requirement to \nbe in possession of a passport or travel document. \n13.24 When to document a temporary resident on a Visitor Record (VR)  \nA BSO at Immigration Secondary who limits a temporary resident’s stay to a period of less \nthan six months has in essence decided that there is a need to exercise an element of \ncontrol over the foreign national’s length of stay; therefore, a VR form IMM 1097B (for \nmanual completion if GCMS is down) or IMM 1442 (in GCMS) is to be issued in order to \ndocument this decision. The BSO should record the reasons why a period of less than six \nmonths is being imposed in the Notes tab of the GCMS application, without delay.  \nSimilarly, the BSO should issue a VR when authorizing a period of stay greater than six \nmonths and indicate in the Notes tab in the GCMS application without delay why the greater \nperiod of time is being granted.  \nA BSO at Immigration Secondary should document a FN on a VR if, in the BSO’s opinion, a \nFN should be documented for control purposes regardless of the length of stay. This could \ninclude:\n74 \n \n \na seafarer who is signing off or seeking entry to join a crew; \n \na FN entering for medical treatment; \n \na person extradited to Canada who is being allowed forward as a temporary resident; \n \nany temporary resident on whom other conditions pursuant to R185 are being \nimposed;   \n \nforeign workers entering Canada to perform after-sales service and intending to \nremain in Canada for longer than two days, except workers performing continuing \nafter-sales service whose entry has already been documented on a VR, the validity of \nwhich covers the period for which the person is seeking entry; or  \n \nmilitary personnel and their accompanying family members entering Canada under \nthe Visiting Forces Act; and \n \nFNs entering as clergy under R186(l).  \nIn certain situations, BSOs should issue a VR to the FN who is WP exempt so that they can \nbenefit from certain privileges, such as obtaining a Social Insurance Number. These \nsituations include: \n \nPublic Policy: Short-term work permit exemption for certain high-skilled work; \n \nPublic Policy: 120-day work permit exemption for researchers; or \n \nMissionaries (e.g.: Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) coming to Canada for more \nthan a six month period. Case type 13 in the GCMS application must be used when \nissuing a VR so that they may apply for and obtain provincial health coverage. \nCreating or adding to an existing client record in GCMS with corresponding Notes will assist \nother BSOs in the event a person applies for an extension or if enforcement action is \nrequired.  \n13.25 Issuing VRs \nVRs should be processed and issued in GCMS. If GCMS is not operational, a BSO at \nImmigration Secondary can complete the VR form [IMM 1097B] manually and enter the \ninformation in GCMS as soon as the system is available. For detailed information on \ncompleting and coding the IMM 1097B form manually, see the coding manual. \nThere are no cost-recovery fees for documenting temporary residents on a VR. \nA BSO who issues a VR, no matter the reason, should enter remarks in the Notes tab of the \napplication, without delay. \n13.26 Imposing, varying or cancelling conditions on temporary \nresidents \nR185 authorizes a BSO at Immigration Secondary to impose, vary or cancel the following \nconditions individually concerning a temporary resident: \n \nthe period authorized for their stay; \n \nthe work in which they are permitted to engage or prohibited from engaging, \nincluding \no \nthe type of work; \no \nthe employer;\n75 \n \no \nthe location of work; and  \no \nthe times and periods of work; \n \nin the case of a member of a crew, the period within which they must join the means \nof transportation; \n \nthe studies in which they are permitted to engage or prohibited from engaging, \nincluding  \no \nthe type of studies or course; \no \nthe location of the studies; and \no \nthe times and periods of the studies; \n \nthe area within which they are permitted or prohibited to travel in Canada; and \n \nthe times and places to which they must report:  \no \nfor medical examination, surveillance or treatment; or \no \nthe presentation of evidence of compliance with applicable conditions. \nAll of these conditions should be imposed in writing by providing the FN with a VR, ST, WP \nor TRP. When conditions of entry are imposed on a manually completed form, it is not \nnecessary to state on the form the conditions precisely as they are worded in the \nRegulations. An attempt to reflect the substance and spirit of the conditions in the \nRegulations and, whenever possible, the wording of R183 and R185 should be used. When a \nBSO at Immigration Secondary completes a form in GCMS, they may select the appropriate \nconditions from the list on the screen.  \nThe BSO should not use conditions as a means of discouraging a FN from coming into \nCanada. The reasons for imposing conditions on a temporary resident are to ensure that the \nperson complies with the period and purpose for which they sought entry into Canada and \nto make the temporary resident aware of the need for formal authorization before extending \nthat period or varying the purposes of the visit.  \n13.27 Situations where specific conditions may be considered \nSituations where specific conditions may be considered include the following: \n \nFor a FN seeking entry to join a crew of a vehicle already in Canada, a BSO at \nImmigration Secondary should impose a condition that would require them to join \nthe means of transportation within a maximum period of time of 48 hours [R184].  \n \nR185(d) authorizes a BSO to impose a condition that limits the area within which a \ntemporary resident may travel in Canada. For example, the BSO might want to use \nthe condition to limit the travel of a person in transit through Canada to another \ncountry (perhaps limiting the person to the airport and surrounding area), or the \ntravel of a person coming to Canada to stand trial or to be a witness in legal \nproceedings. \n \nR185(e) authorizes the BSO to impose a condition on a temporary resident who \notherwise complies with the Act and Regulations, but who has a medical condition of \npublic health significance in Canada. The condition should name the time and place \nwhere the temporary resident must report for medical observation and treatment \nwhile in Canada. For more information on medical surveillance, please refer to \nsection 12.10 above and manual OP15, Medical Procedures. \n \nIf the BSO imposes conditions on a temporary resident concerning attendance at a \nschool, work, or medical examination, surveillance or treatment, the BSO should, as \na control measure, also impose a condition requiring the person to present evidence \nof compliance with the conditions imposed [as authorized by R185(e)(ii)].\n76 \n \n13.28 Deposits and Guarantees \nR45(1) authorizes a BSO at Immigration Secondary to require, with respect to a person or \ngroup of persons seeking to enter Canada, the payment of a deposit or the posting of a \nguarantee, or both, to the Minister to guarantee compliance with the conditions imposed on \nthe person or group.  \nThe payment of a deposit or the posting of a guarantee is a control measure in cases where \nthe BSO believes that a temporary resident or group of temporary residents may not \ncomply with one or more conditions being imposed. The deposit or guarantee should specify \nan amount adequate to guarantee compliance and therefore alleviate doubt regarding a \ntemporary resident’s intentions in Canada.  \nFor more information on situations that may warrant a deposit or a guarantee, or how to \nproceed, refer to ENF 8, Deposits and Guarantees. \n13.29 Counselling temporary residents \nA BSO should attempt to answer any questions a temporary resident has concerning their \nstatus. When a BSO at Immigration Secondary counsels a temporary resident, they may \nwish to cover the following points:  \n \nthe expiry date of the visit; \n \nany conditions imposed; \n \nprocedures for applying for an extension; \n \ncost-recovery requirements should the person seek an extension to their status; and  \n \ninformation about the cancellation of conditions imposed and a refund if the person \nhas paid a deposit or posted a guarantee (see ENF 8, Deposits and Guarantees). \nThe sections to follow provide more detailed procedures for the examination of specific \nclasses of persons seeking to enter Canada. \n13.30 Recovering missing, abducted and exploited children  \nSee ENF 21, Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children, for more information on \npolicies and procedures relating to examining children seeking to enter Canada.  \n13.31 Examining foreign students \nAll FNs require written authorization obtained from an IRCC visa office in order to come \nstudy in Canada. Certain exemptions apply when it comes to needing a SP. See OP 12, \nStudents, for specifics. \nCertain FN are eligible to apply for a SP at the POE as per R214. With few exemptions, all \nQuebec-bound study permit applicants must submit a Certificat d’acceptation du Québec \n(CAQ) or a confirmation letter from the Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de \nl’Intégration (MIFI) when applying for a study permit. The CAQ is issued for a maximum of \n49 months. Persons exempted from this requirement can be found on the MIFI’s web site.\n77 \n \nQuebec’s Regulation respecting the selection of foreign nationals states at paragraph 49(g) \nthat those mentioned at R214 are excluded from the requirement of obtaining a CAQ for a \nperiod of not more than six (6) weeks from their arrival to Canada. Should they not yet \nhave a CAQ but meet all other eligibility criteria to apply for a SP at the POE, the BSO may \nissue a SP for a maximum of six (6) weeks and charge the fees. BSOs should also explain \nthe situation in the permit’s Notes tab without delay. When the FN mentioned at R214  \nreceives their CAQ, they will have to apply for and pay the fees for a new SP.  \nFor more information on this exemption, please refer to section 2.2 Programme des \nétudiants étrangers of the Guide des procédures d’immigration of the MIFI (available only in \nFrench). \n13.32 Maritime procedures \nSee ENF 17, Maritime Procedures, for information on the examination of persons seeking \nentry as crew members or wanting to become a member of a crew. \n13.33 Examining foreign workers \nRemarks on VRs allowing people to work in Canada \nService Canada is asking that visible remarks be entered on VRs when a VR is issued to a \nperson who is exempt of the need for a WP. Service Canada needs to know that the person \nis allowed to work in Canada and is exempt from the need for a WP so a social insurance \nnumber may be issued. BSOs at Immigration Secondary should clearly enter in the User \nRemarks section of the VR that the temporary resident is exempt from the need to obtain a \nWP under either: R186, the 120-day WP exemption for researchers in a publicly funded \nCanadian degree-granting institution (or its affiliated research institution) or the 15- or 30-\nday WP exemption for certain high-skilled workers.For more information on these last two, \nsee  section 13.24 above and OB PRG-2017-26, New Work Permit Exemptions for High-\nSkilled Short-term Work and for Research. \nSeasonal agricultural workers \nThere are two streams of agricultural workers: \n \nthe Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP) stream open to citizens of Mexico \nand other participating Caribbean countries; and \n \nthe agricultural stream (non-SAWP). \nLike all other temporary foreign workers, seasonal agricultural workers in both streams \nrequire social insurance numbers (SIN) while working in Canada. As of April 1, 2003, all \nsocial insurance cards issued to temporary residents have expiry dates on them, coinciding \nwith the end of the validity period of the WP. \nIt is important that the expiry date matches the last date of the validity of the temporary \nresident’s WP.\n78 \n \nTemporary residents who require a social insurance card may find the application form on \nthe Service Canada website. \nSAWP work permits should always: \n \nhave an expiry date of December 15th of the current calendar year no matter the \nduration of employment indicated on the Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMAI). \nThe only exception to limiting the WP to a date other then December 15th would be if \nthe FN’s travel document expires before December 15th;  \n \n98 as the Case Type in GCMS; and \n \nhave the following User Remarks already added by the issuing office: “Approved \nMEX/CCSAWP employer only. Valid to work in ALL PROVINCES. Period of cumulative \nwork not to exceed employment duration specified in the LMIA to a maximum of 8 \nmonths – R185(b)(iv)”.     \nFor more information on the SAWP, visit - Hire a temporary worker through the Seasonal \nAgricultural Worker Program - Overview - Canada.ca \nFor more information on the non-SAWP stream, visit Hire a temporary foreign worker \nthrough the Agricultural Stream: Overview – Canada.ca \n \nRole of countries sending seasonal workers \nAgencies from sending countries must make sure of the following: at least 48 hours in \nadvance, accurate departure lists of workers are sent directly to the CBSA airport office in \nCanada to ensure that the WPs are prepared (printed) before the arrival of each flight. \n \nNote: IRCC and Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) require that \nBSOs cancel the pre-printed WPs if the worker did not arrive on the scheduled date \nnor the following day. This ensures that employer compliance conditions are not \nimposed on an employer erroneously and allows IRCC to use the Labor Market \nImpact Assessment (LMIA) to issue a WP for another worker, if needed. \nAt the airport in Canada \nEach worker is referred to Immigration Secondary by a BSO at the PIL and presents their \nown: \n \nvalid passport; and \n \nWP introduction letter, issued by a visa office.  \nRole of BSOs at Immigration Secondary  \nBSOs at Immigration Secondary must make sure of the following: \n \nVerify the identity of the passport holder;\n79 \n \n \nMake sure the WP information is correct and matches the passport’s biographical \ndata; \n \nStamp and properly annotate the passport with the expiry date, their initials and \ndocument number of the WP; and \n \n“Close the loop” in ICS. \n13.34 Refugee claimants \nFor information on processing refugee claimants, refer to IRCC’s PDI, In-Canada claims for \nrefugee protection. For instructions on handling possible claims for refugee protection see \nsection 13 of ENF 6, Review of reports under A44(1). \nFor information on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, visit the UNHCR \nwebsite. \n13.35 Vulnerable persons \nA vulnerable person is a person who has significant difficulties coping with the examination \nprocess, due to a specific condition or circumstance. \nExamples of persons who may be identified as vulnerable could be someone who is:  \n \nelderly;  \n \npregnant; \n \nwith physical disabilities or injuries;  \n \nan unaccompanied minor children;  \n \na victim of gender-based and/or family violence; \n \na victim of human trafficking;  \n \na victim of trauma; and \n \nchildren, including those who are victims of abuse.  \nIndividuals react to violence and trauma in various ways, and not all victims of violence \nand/or trauma exhibit identical or even similar symptoms. While some individuals may show \nsigns of distress, including anxiety, irritability, nervousness, agitation, anger and \naggressiveness, others may be easily intimidated and have difficulty communicating. The \nimportance of building trust with victims/survivors might be helpful. For example, officers \nmay need to explain how the examination process works, and their role as officers, to \nestablish credibility and build trust. Officers should keep in mind that establishing a rapport \nand earning a victim’s trust will help victims to be more open and to feel more comfortable \nabout providing information. It may be helpful to separate individuals when conducting \ninterviews if the BSO suspects there may be violence, trafficking, etc. involved. Also ask the \nvictim whether they would be more comfortable in the presence of a female or male officer.  \n \nFN victims brought to Canada by human traffickers for exploitation purposes are exposed to \nincreased vulnerabilities because they may have little or no knowledge of Canadian \ncustoms, laws and human rights, and this lack of knowledge may be used by the trafficker \nto compel the victim to provide their labour or service. Victims may react with fear, \nsuspicion, skepticism, distrust, hesitation and/or hostility towards outsiders, especially law \nenforcement. They may worry about their immigration status in Canada and/or fear of being \nissued a removal order and deported. They may also be concerned about the continued \navailability of services in Canada.\n80 \n \n \nTrauma occurs when a victim lives through an experience so extreme that they cannot \ncompletely comprehend or accept it. Consequently, it falls so far outside the victim’s own \nsystem of values for human behaviour that they cannot rationalize it and may even deny \nthat it ever happened. Key symptoms of trauma likely to have serious implications include: \n \n \ndenial of being a victim of gender-based violence (GBV), even in the face of \ncontradictory evidence; \n \nde-personalization of the abusive experience and coming to regard it as having \nhappened to another person; \n \nfragmentation of memory, perception, feeling, consciousness and sense of time; \n \ndifficulty in providing a clear and consistent statements to investigation; and \n \ntendency to fill in memory blanks by making up plausible elements of a traumatic \nsituation. \nDue to these types of trauma, one of the optimal methods for working with victims is to \nhelp them feel stable by providing security and assistance. \nAs a general principle, all offices must be flexible to provide priority processing to travellers \nwho are identified as vulnerable persons.  \nFor additional information on identifying and processing vulnerable persons, see IRCC’s PDI, \nProcessing in-Canada Claims for Refugee protection of minors and vulnerable persons and \nAddressing cases where a person has experienced abuse. \nFor Trafficking in Persons, refer to CBSA’s Enforcement Manual, part 2, chapter 15. \nVictims Support \nIn Canada, responsibility for the protection of victims of crime is shared between the federal \nand provincial/territorial governments. Numerous programs and services are available to \nvictims of crime, including trafficking. These range from health care to emergency housing, \nand social and legal assistance. Legal-aid programs are administered separately by each \nprovince and territory, and eligibility is based primarily on financial need. Similarly, social \nservices such as emergency financial assistance, including food allowances and housing, are \nadministered at the provincial and territorial levels and are available to those in need. \n \nA TRP may be issued by IRCC for victims of family violence or victims of trafficking in \npersons (VTIP). Should a TRP be issued by IRCC, essential medical care will be provided \nthrough the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program. A vulnerable person, such as a victim of \nGBV, may be without documents or lack resources such as finances, shelter, or family and \nfriends. However, when a potential victim without legal status is identified at a POE or \nInland, and the local IRCC office is unavailable for an interview, the CBSA should ensure the \ncustody and safety of the individual by releasing them on conditions into the care of a NGO, \nin an immigration holding center, or into the care of a family member. The CBSA must \nexercise reasonable care for the victim’s protection and well-being.  \n \nAll encountered victims of family violence or trafficking in persons who are FNs, should \nimmediately be referred to IRCC for an interview on immigration options (which could \ninclude issuance of a TRP.  \nNote: The CBSA should immediately contact local Child Protection Services when \nencountering a child who is believed to be a victim of abuse.\n81 \n \n13.36 Biometrically enrolled FNs and PRs \nBiometrically enrolled FNs and PRs arriving at a POE will have their travel documents \nexamined and their biometrics compared or verified to assist in making an admissibility \ndecision. \nR12.1 lists in which situation biometrics must be collected. \nR12.2(1) lists the persons exempt of having their biometrics collected.  \nR12.5 outlines the procedure for biometric verification upon entry to Canada. \nWhen seeking entry to Canada and when directed by an officer or by alternative means of \nexamination, a biometrically enrolled person shall provide their biometrics for verification. \nBiometric Verification – IPIL \nIf the traveller was biometrically enrolled, the biographic data and photo collected at the \ntime of application will be displayed on the IPIL screen under the Bio tab. The BSO will \ncompare the biometric enrollment photo displayed in IPIL to the traveller and will select \nwhether the photo matches or does not match. If the BSO has doubts as to the traveller’s \nidentity, the BSO will refer the traveller to Immigration Secondary for fingerprint \nverification. \nBiometric Verification – PIK with systematic fingerprint verification (SFV) \nBiometrically enrolled travellers who complete their primary processing via PIK with SFV will \nbe prompted by the system to complete a fingerprint verification. A no-match result will \ngenerate a referral to Immigration Secondary.  \nAt POEs where PIK does not have SFV integrated, the traveller will not be referred to \nImmigration Secondary but to a referral officer who will do a facial comparison. Should the \nBSO have doubts on the traveller’s identity, they may refer them to Immigration Secondary \nfor fingerprint verification. \nShould the verifications raise doubts regarding the identity of the foreign national, existing \nprocedures will be followed to determine admissibility.  \nSee part 11, chapter 7 of the People Processing Manual for further information on the \nprocessing of biometrically enrolled FNs. For guidelines, refer to the Job Aid on Systematic \nFingerprint Verification. \nAlso, BSOs can refer to OBO-2022-02, 2021-HQ-AC-01-19, PRG-2019-07, PRG-2018-69 and \n2018-HQ-AC-OPS-12-11 for more information. \n13.37 Collection of Biometrics at POEs \nBiometrics screening helps to keep Canadians safe. The collection (through enrolment) and \nverification of biometrics, along with criminal and immigration screening and biometric-\nbased information sharing, strengthen the integrity of Canada's immigration program. This\n82 \n \nhelps prevent identity fraud, identify those who pose a security risk and stop known \ncriminals from entering Canada. \nAs per R12.1 the collection of biometrics at the POE is mandatory for WPs, SPs, TRPs, \nasylum claimants and a limited number of resettled refugees where IRCC has provided a \ntemporary exemption to the biometric requirement as per R12.8. The enrolment can only be \ndone at select Immigration Secondary where there is a LiveScan Kiosk as per R12.001.  \nIn order for the biometrics to be automatically associated to the client, the application must \nbe created in GCMS prior to capturing the traveller's fingerprints for enrollment. Should the \nautomatic association fail, BSOs will have to manually associate the biometrics to the \napplication. For additional information on querying the biometrics holding tank in GCMS and \nassociating biometrics, please refer to Search and Associating Biometrics document and \nVideo: GCMS Support for Fingerprints in the Holding Tank. \nFor more information such as guides on enrolling biometrics, please consult the Biometrics \nToolkit on Atlas as well as the LiveScan User Guide and Quick Reference Card. \nAdditional guidance can also be found in OBO-2020-075. \n14 Dual intent \nA22(2) states that the intention of a FN to become a PR does not preclude them from \nbecoming a temporary resident if the BSO is satisfied that they will leave Canada by the end \nof the period authorized for their stay. \nA person’s desire to await the outcome of an application for permanent residence from \nwithin Canada may be legitimate and should not automatically result in the decision to \nrefuse entry. A BSO at Immigration Secondary should distinguish between such a person \nand an applicant who has no intention of leaving Canada if the application is refused. \nIn rendering a decision, the BSO should consider: \n \nthe length of time required to process the application for PR status; \n \nthe means of support; \n \nobligations and ties in the home country; \n \nthe likelihood of the applicant leaving Canada if the application is refused; and \n \ncompliance with the requirements of the Act and Regulations while in Canada. \nIn some cases, the BSO may wish to issue a VR documenting the details of the trip for \ncontrol purposes and provide thorough counselling regarding the conditions of entry. The \nBSO should enter remarks in the Notes tab of the application in GCMS detailing their \nreasoning and counselling given, without delay. In cases where the applicant has already \nreceived a favourable recommendation for PR status, the duration of time authorized at the \nPOE should match the time required to complete the processing of the application.\n83 \n \n15 Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) \nA BSO at Immigration Secondary has discretion, pursuant to A24(1), to issue a TRP to an \ninadmissible FN seeking entry to Canada if satisfied that entry is justified in the \ncircumstances. Consult IRCC’s PDI on Temporary Resident Permits for more information. \n15.1 Process at the POE for persons approved for a TRP by a visa \noffice \n \nBackground: Visa offices that approve TRP applications will generate the TRP \nelectronically in GCMS for issuance at the POE. This process is similar to the present \nprocess being used when a SP or WP is issued by a visa office.  \n \nLetter of introduction: The applicant arrives at the POE with a letter of introduction \nfrom the visa office. The top right-hand corner of the letter has the application \nnumber. BSOs must do an Integrated Name search and not an application number \nsearch in GCMS. This ensures the BSO uses the appropriate application in GCMS.  \n \nFacilitation counterfoil: Visa offices issue a facilitation counterfoil [IMM 1346] to \nFNs who are from a country where a visa is required and have been approved for a \nTRP. This counterfoil allows the FN to board a commercial carrier bound for Canada. \n \nThere are two types of facilitation counterfoils that can be issued to TRP holders \n(single entry or multiple entry): \no \nWhen a FN from a visa-required country has been approved by a visa office to \ntravel to Canada to receive a TRP, a counterfoil coded PA-1 will be issued by \nthe visa office. \no \nWhen a FN from a visa-required country has been approved by a visa office to \ntravel to Canada to receive a TRP that authorizes re-entry to Canada, the FN \nmust apply at a visa office for a facilitation counterfoil prior to returning to \nCanada. This counterfoil will be provided at no cost and be coded PC-1. \nNote: Officers at Immigration Secondary must counsel the FN that, should they leave, they \nrequire a counterfoil prior to returning to Canada. \n15.2 Issuing a TRP approved by a visa office \nThe BSO at Immigration Secondary will do the following: \n \nDetermine whether the FN is still eligible for the TRP by assessing whether there is \nany material change in circumstances and ascertaining whether there are other \ngrounds of inadmissibility since being issued the documentation from the visa office; \n \nRetrieve information from GCMS by doing an Integrated Name Search using the \nclient’s bio data; \n \nEnter the required information, such as contact address in Canada into GCMS; \n \nPrint the TRP on an IMM 1442B form and attach the foreign national’s passport-sized \nphotograph. Should the FN not provide a photograph, it should be taken at the POE; \n \nStamp the foreign national’s passport and notate as per the CBSA stamp policy; and \n \nCounsel FNs from visa-required countries to obtain a facilitation counterfoil by a visa \noffice if they wish to leave and re-enter Canada.\n84 \n \n15.3 Process for initiating a TRP at the POE \nOfficers may issue TRPs when justifiable and with awareness that the document carries \nprivileges greater than those accorded to other temporary residents (visitors, students and \nworkers). It allows the holder to apply inland for a WP or SP and may give access to health \nor other social services. It also allows certain holders who remains in Canada continuously \nfor a specified period of time, and who do not become inadmissible on other grounds, to be \ngranted PR status. Factors to consider prior to issuing a TRP are listed below in section 15.4. \nFor cases involving serious criminal inadmissibility, a brief email outlining the case \ndetails (red flagged to indicate high importance) is to be sent to the CBSA’s Case \nManagement Branch. Referral to IRCC’s Case Management Branch is not required unless the \ncase is high profile or contentious, in which case officers are encouraged to consult with \nIRCC’s Case Management Branch. Detailed remarks must always be included in the \nappropriate systems when documents are issued. \nFor cases involving inadmissibility on health grounds, officers should send a short case \nsummary by email to IRCC’s Migration Health Branch. \nOnce the officer has made the decision to issue a TRP, the following procedures must be \nfollowed to ensure that all elements of the decision-making process are documented and all \npolicies and procedures are adhered to, in accordance with IL 3 – Designation of Officers \nand Delegation of Authority: \n \nCreate a paper TRP file for each client by printing and completing Appendix D’s \nTemporary Resident Permit Checklist. \n \nAdd the foreign national’s contact address in Canada to GCMS. \n \nCheck validity dates and indicate whether the person shall be allowed to leave and \nre-enter Canada. \n \nCollect the $200 processing fee if required (see section 15.6). \n \nPrint the TRP on an IMM 1442B.  \n \nStamp the foreign national’s passport as per the CBSA stamp policy. \n \nCounsel FNs from visa-required countries to obtain a facilitation counterfoil by a visa \noffice if they wish to leave and re-enter Canada. \n \nCounsel the FN about their inadmissibility and the ramifications of that inadmissibility \nfor future trips to Canada (e.g. require a TRP be issued by visa office prior to any \nfuture trips to Canada). \n \nCreate a note in GCMS regarding your justification for issuing a TRP and the \ncounselling given. This is important as it can be referenced if the FN did not heed the \ncounselling given their last trip. \n15.4 Assessment of need and risk when issuing a TRP \nAn inadmissible person’s need to enter or remain in Canada must be compelling and \nsufficient enough to overcome the health or safety risks to Canadian society. \nOfficers must consider the factors that make the person’s presence in Canada necessary \n(family ties, job qualifications, economic contribution, attending an event) and the intent of \nthe legislation (protecting public health and the healthcare system).\n85 \n \nNote: only IRCC can issue a TRP to victims of human trafficking, suspected victims of \nhuman trafficking, and victims of family violence. \nFactors to consider \nA TRP can be issued for up to three years. Will the TRP be valid for re-entry or for only \none trip? \nCriminality \nMedical \nOther \n \nWhat was the \nseriousness of the \noffence? \n \nDid the crime \ninvolve physical \nharm or violence? \n \nWhat was the \npunishment \nreceived for the \noffence? \n \nWhat are the \nchances of \nsuccessful \nsettlement without \ncommitting further \noffences? \n \nWere drugs or \nalcohol involved? \n \nIs there evidence \nthat the person \nhas been reformed \nor is rehabilitated? \n \nIs there a pattern \nof criminal \nbehaviour? \n \nIs the person \neligible for a \npardon or \nrehabilitation? \n \nHow long has it \nbeen since the \noffence occurred? \n \nIs the person suffering \nfrom a communicable \nor contagious disease? \n \nHow severe is the \nperson’s anticipated \nneed for health or \nsocial services in \nrelation to the demand \nfor these services by \nCanadian residents? \n \nWhat is the cost of the \ntreatment? \n \nHow will the costs be \ncovered? \n \nWill provincial public \nhealth insurers \nprovide insurance \ncoverage? \n \nIs this a first-time visit \nand is the person \nunaware of their \ninadmissibility? \n \nIs there an economic \nbenefit for Canadians \nif the person is coming \nfor business reasons? \n \nIs this an urgent \nfamily situation such \nas a funeral, wedding \nor other low-risk \ncompassionate \nreason? \n \nIs there a pattern of \nprevious or multiple \nviolations of the Act or \nRegulations? \n \nAre there public \ncontroversial elements \nto the case that \nwarrant a referral to \nNational \nHeadquarters? \n \nIs there a settlement \nrisk, as persons \ncontinuously on a TRP \nfor a specified period \nof time will be granted \npermanent residence? \n \nAre there any \nIndigenous cultural \nconsiderations?\n86 \n \n15.5 GCMS remarks \nWhen issuing a TRP, officers must enter detailed notes, a record of their decision and their \nrecommendation (where applicable) in the Notes tab of the application in GCMS. These notes \nmay be used in future applications, or in enforcement actions, therefore, the notes need to clearly \nexplain the reasons for the decision to issue a TRP, and reflect that the decision was made in \naccordance with all existing policies and procedures. The detailed notes in GCMS must include:  \n1. The details and reason for seeking entry  \no \nExamples of the above should include: the destination, travel dates and the FN’s \noverall reason for the trip (e.g. work, a family matter, a political meeting, etc.) \n2. The allegation of inadmissibility \no What section(s) of IRPA and IRPR apply, and describe how the FN is \ninadmissible; \nNote: If the allegation is based on criminality, the remarks must include: \n \nThe circumstances of each offence and the punishment that was imposed or \ncould be imposed if committed in Canada, including all applicable dates. \n \nThe foreign criminal/penal code conviction(s) and its equivalent(s) in the \nCanadian statute in question; * \n \n3. The officer's reasons  for the decision to issue a TRP. \no This is where the officer is required to explain why the issuance of a TRP is \njustified in the circumstances. Describe how the reason the FN is seeking entry, \noutweighs the risk presented by the FN entering and staying in Canada (the risk is \nbased on the FN's inadmissibility) which is explained with examples above in 15.4.  \n \no Consider the following reasons:  \n economic contribution,  \n national interest,  \n personal reasons,  \n political visit,  \nministerial intervention;  \n \n4. How the duration of the TRP was determined, if the condition to confirm departure  has \nbeen imposed and what risks have been taken into account in either granting or refusing \nre-entry.\n87 \n \n5. Any available contact information for themselves and/or their Canadian reception (e.g. \nphone number, email, address of accommodation)  \n \n*Officers will encounter cases where the FN has admitted to having criminal convictions, but \nsystems checks do not show the details, and the FN does not know exactly what they were \nconvicted of and/or the foreign criminal/penal code is not accessible. In these cases, officers will \nhave to determine through further questioning, what transpired in order for the FN to have been \narrested/charged/convicted/etc. in order to determine the elements of the offence and to best \nequate the offence to the Canadian Criminal Code or other statute. (e.g. how much time \nincarcerated, was a fine paid, was community service ordered, etc.) \nImportant \n \nIf the TRP has been approved by a designated authority, the name and position of that \ndesignated authority must be recorded in the GCMS notes. See IL 3 – Designation of \nOfficers and Delegation of Authority \n \nIf notes have been entered by any officer other than the examining officer, those  notes \nmust be prefaced by who is entering them and who they are being entered on behalf of \n(e.g. The following notes have been entered into GCMS by BSO R. Smith #12345 on \nbehalf of Superintendent B. Hart #23456 who is the designated authority and decision \nmaker in the issuance of this TRP.) \n15.6 Public policy: Fee exemption for certain TRPs  \nCertain TRPs issued to FNs who are inadmissible are fee-exempt under public policy.  \nAs of March 1, 2012, a public policy went into effect wherein certain FNs who are \ninadmissible under A36(2) are exempt (one time only) from the fee for a TRP. \nThe fee-exempt TRP may be considered only if all of the following conditions apply: \n \nThe person was convicted of an offence, not including child pornography or any \nsexual offence, and received no term of imprisonment as part of the sentence \nimposed. \n \nThere have been no other convictions or acts committed that would render the \nperson inadmissible. \nThe fee exemption is available to those who meet the criteria even if they have been issued \na TRP in the past. \nBefore issuing the TRP, officers must check GCMS to ensure the one-time fee-exempt TRP \nhas not already been granted. Officers must also counsel the FN that they are inadmissible \nto Canada and that they are being facilitated with a one-time only fee-exempt TRP, that a\n88 \n \nTRP is only issued in exceptional circumstances, and that they should apply for another TRP \nat a visa office if they wish to return to Canada in the future, or to apply for individual \nrehabilitation if they meet the requirements to do so. \nOn January 11, 2012, the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism \napproved a public policy that allows BSOs to grant an exemption from the TRP cost recovery \nfee for TWOV/CTP and emergency landing travellers from visa-required countries who find \nthemselves improperly documented (A41) upon arrival in Canada through no fault of their \nown. \nBSOs should make the validity of the TRP coincide with the FN's newly scheduled departure \ntime. \nBSOs issuing TRPs under these circumstances should include the following note in GCMS \nand on the document: “TRP fee exemption granted pursuant to Fee Exemption for \nTemporary Resident Permits Issued to Foreign Nationals in the Transit Without Visa \nProgram, the China Transit Program and Emergency Landing Situations.” \nFor more information on the Cost recovery fee exemption for TRPs for A36(2), consult \noperational bulletin PRG-2012-34. \nFor more information on the Cost recovery fee exemption under the TWOV/CTP and \nemergency landing, consult operational bulletin OBO-2019-040 and IRCC’s PDI on the \nsubject. \n15.7 TRPs issued in high-profile, complex, sensitive or contentious \ncases \nThe designated authority must inform the CBSA’s Case Management and IRCC’s NHQ \nmailbox by sending a brief email (red-flagged to indicate high importance) outlining the \ncase details when they issue a TRP. Detailed remarks must always be included in the \nappropriate systems when TRPs are issued. \nFor more information on these cases, refer to IRCC’s PDI on the subject. \n \n \n15.8 National Interest TRPs \nIn the event that persons approved for a National Interest TRP (NI-TRP) are referred to \nImmigration Secondary, officers will note the special coding of the TRP (PAX-1) and the \ninformation in GCMS and allow the person to proceed as normal. The information in GCMS \nwill indicate the details for the authorization of the TRP, mainly that no TRP document \nwill be given to the subject at the POE, and that the holder of an NI-TRP counterfoil \nissued by the visa office does not require referral to Immigration Secondary at the POE for \nthe sole purpose of processing the TRP.\n89 \n \nIf the holder of an NI-TRP is referred to Immigration Secondary, an email message should \nbe sent to IRCC’s Case Management Branch and the issuing visa office. \nFor more information on NI-TRP, please refer to IRCC OB 463.  \n15.9 Designated authority to issue a TRP \nThe designated authority to issue a TRP could be found in the Instrument of Designation \nand Delegation (IL 3) and is listed below: \nBSO \n \nA36(2), Criminality \n \nA39, Financial reasons \n \nA40, Misrepresentation \n \nA41, Non-compliance \n \nA42, Inadmissible family member \nSuperintendent \n \nA36(1), Serious criminality \n \nA38, Health grounds \nIRCC NHQ only \n \nA34, Security \n \nA35, Human or international rights violations \n \nA37, Organized criminality \nCancelling a TRP  \n \nCertain CBSA officials have now been added to the list of persons who are \ndesignated by the Minister to cancel TRPs. Previously, only IRCC officials had this \nauthority. For the complete list of persons designated to cancel a TRP, refer to \nitem 106 of the IRCC Instruments of Designation and Delegation (D & D) \nInstruments.  \n \nFor more details, please refer to OBO-2019-042. \n15.10 TRP file folder retention and storage \nFile folders should be stored in a secure cabinet for two years and then destroyed using an \napproved shredder. \n \n15.11 Validity of TRPs\n90 \n \nPursuant to R63, a TRP is valid until any one of the following events occurs: \n \nthe permit is cancelled by the delegated authority under A24(1); \n \nthe permit holder leaves Canada without obtaining prior authorization to re-enter \nCanada; \n \nthe period of validity specified on the permit expires; or \n \na period of three years elapses from its date of validity. \n15.12 TRPs valid for re-entry to Canada \nBSOs should be aware that a TRP holder from a country where a visa is required with prior \nauthorization to re-enter Canada may seek entry to Canada without having obtained a \nfacilitation counterfoil [IMM 1346 counterfoil, coded PA-1 or PC-1] from a visa office. In \nthese cases, the TRP holder is to be granted entry to Canada following a favourable \nexamination for identity and admissibility. The fact that they obtained passage to Canada \nwithout the facilitation counterfoil (PA-1 or PC-1 counterfoil) does not render the FN \ninadmissible. However, a TRP holder, if not exempt under R52(2), will be inadmissible if \nthey fail to produce a valid passport or travel document. \nNote: For more information on TRPs, see IRCC’s manual IP 1 and PDI, Temporary Resident \nPermits. \n16 Persons allowed into Canada by law \n16.1 Persons under removal order who are refused entry to another \ncountry \nA person subject to an enforceable removal order who leaves Canada, but is refused entry \ninto the country they departed to and are subsequently returned to Canada, by force of \ncircumstances, shall be allowed to enter Canada pursuant to R39. \nAlthough a BSO at Immigration Secondary shall allow these persons to enter Canada, they \ncontinue to be subject to removal as the removal order remains unenforced as per \nR240(1)(d). The BSO should ensure that the person is in possession of documentation \nconfirming that they have been refused entry to the country to which they were seeking \nentry. If there has been a lengthy delay between the person’s departure and return, the \nBSO should investigate to ensure that the person has not been authorized to legally enter \nanother country. It is reasonable to expect that the person should be returning to Canada \non the next available flight from the country they had attempted to enter. \nIf the BSO is satisfied that the person was not legally authorized to enter another country, \nthe BSO should counsel the person that they are still under a removal order and that the \npayment of a deposit, the posting of a guarantee or any conditions imposed remain in \neffect. \nThe BSO may impose new conditions or, without a warrant, arrest and detain the person, \nother than a protected person under A55(2), for removal if the BSO is satisfied that the \nperson is a danger to the public or would be unlikely to appear for removal, especially if the \nperson had been in detention prior to departure.\n91 \n \nFor more information, see ENF 10, Removals. \n16.2 Persons with certificates of departure who are refused entry to \nanother country \nIf a person has been issued a Certificate of Departure form [IMM 0056B] on departing \nCanada and is not granted entry to another country, the BSO at Immigration Secondary \nshould cancel the Removal (Certificate of Departure) in GCMS and create a Note indicating \nthat that the person was refused entry to that country and was allowed back into Canada \npursuant to R39(a). The GCMS Notes should state that the person was not authorized to \nlegally enter another country and has not met the requirements of the removal order. \nTherefore, the officer should ensure that there is an enforceable removal order in GCMS (a \nnew removal order may need to be generated). The order remains outstanding and the \nperson is still required to leave Canada. The BSO may consider whether detention is \nappropriate or whether the person can and will voluntarily effect their departure. The BSO \nshould also notify the removal officer, if it was an Inland case, of the situation via email. \nFor guidelines on Certificate of Departure cases, see section 28 of ENF 10, Removals. \nSeizure of documents \nIf the person is in possession of any travel or identity documents, the BSO should consider \nwhether it is appropriate to seize the documents to facilitate their future removal from \nCanada. The documents would be forwarded to the office handling the removal.  \nSee section 8 of ENF 12, Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing, for procedures \nrelating to the seizure of documents.  \n16.3 Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MLACMA) \nUnder R39(b), persons returning to Canada under a transfer order made under the Mutual \nLegal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MLACMA) shall be allowed to enter Canada. This \napplies only to persons who, immediately before being transferred to a foreign state under \nthe transfer order, were subject to an unenforced removal order. \nThe MLACMA and treaties implemented under its authority are used by prosecutors, police \nagencies and other government investigative agencies responsible for the investigation and \nprosecution of criminal offences. Assistance provided on a reciprocal basis may include \nactivities such as locating and questioning witnesses, obtaining search warrants, locating \nsuspects and fugitives from justice, obtaining evidence, and transferring persons in custody \nfor the purposes of assisting in investigations or testifying in criminal proceedings. \nThe MLACMA, proclaimed on October 1, 1988, enables Canada to implement treaties, signed \nwith foreign states that oblige Canada to provide legal assistance in the investigation, \nprosecution and suppression of criminal offences. The Minister of Justice is responsible for \nthe implementation of treaties and for the administration of the MLACMA.\n92 \n \nThe provisions of the MLACMA prevail over those of IRPA, except for statutes limiting or \nprohibiting the disclosure of information. The effect of the MLACMA and any treaties that \nflow from it on the CBSA’s operations are limited to three areas: \n \nfacilitating the transfer of persons at POEs; \n \ntaking enforcement action against persons who are allowed to enter Canada for the \npurposes of mutual legal assistance and who violate any of the conditions of an \nauthorization to enter Canada granted by the Minister of Justice; and \n \nexchanging information. \nThe MLACMA allows for testimony, in a foreign state, by officers who, during the \nperformance of their duties, encounter persons wanted for crimes in a foreign state or \ninvolved in criminal activity. Requests for officers to testify in the United States are usually \nmade by the Office of International Affairs, which is a branch of the US Department of \nJustice, to the Canadian Department of Justice. The appropriate course to follow in these \ncases is set out in the MLACMA, the Canada-United States treaty implementing this Act and \nthe related government policies and procedures.  \nOfficers who are called to testify should be aware of the Privacy Act, which prohibits the \ndisclosure of personal information unless an international agreement or arrangement exists. \nThere is also a Statement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing (SMU) between \nIRCC, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (USINS), and the U.S. Department of \nState (DOS), which allows participants to assist each other in the administration and \nenforcement of their respective immigration laws by providing information that might \notherwise be prohibited under the Privacy Act. \nWhenever possible, the Minister of Justice will provide notice to the responsible immigration \nrepresentative, of the place, date and time of arrival of a person coming to Canada for the \npurposes of mutual legal assistance. The representative will in turn notify the POE \nconcerned to ensure that a BSO is present to facilitate that person’s movement through the \nPOE. \nAuthorizations to enter Canada \nUnder section 40 of the MLACMA, the Minister of Justice has the authority to authorize an \ninadmissible FN to enter Canada.  \nA BSO at the PIL must refer for a secondary examination, any person seeking to come into \nCanada under the authority of an Authorization to Enter Canada, issued by the Minister of \nJustice of Canada. \nPersons arriving at POE and seeking to come forward under an authorization signed by the \nMinister of Justice do not come within the jurisdiction of the CBSA. Such persons are not \nsubject to normal passport and visa requirements, nor can a BSO examine them to \ndetermine admissibility or detain them. \nLaw-enforcement officers will always escort incarcerated persons from one institution to the \nother. Persons who are not incarcerated in a foreign state and who are coming to Canada in \ncompliance with a request made by a Canadian investigative or prosecuting authority will be \nmet at the POE by a police officer.\n93 \n \nIn both cases, the escorting officer or the police officer will present a BSO at Immigration \nSecondary with a copy of the authorization issued by the Minister of Justice. The \nauthorization will indicate the person’s name, citizenship, the destination, the specific period \nof time during which the person is authorized to remain in Canada and any additional \nconditions that the Minister of Justice deems appropriate [subsection 40(1) of the MLACMA]. \nThe conditions may include reporting to an Inland office during the person’s stay and may \nbe varied by the Minister of Justice, particularly with respect to the granting of any \nextension of the time period for which the person is authorized to remain in Canada. \nWhen a BSO at Immigration Secondary receives a copy of the authorization to enter Canada \ngranted by the Minister of Justice, the BSO must forward it directly to the regional \nrepresentative responsible for enforcement. The regional representative will ensure that the \nauthorization is sent on for monitoring purposes to the responsible CBSA office in whose \narea the person concerned is authorized to stay. \nA person who comes into Canada under an authorization of the Minister of Justice, and who \nfails to comply with the conditions set out in the authorization is deemed, for the purposes \nof IRPA, to be a person who entered Canada as a temporary resident and remains after the \nperiod authorized for their stay [subsection 40(3) of the MLACMA]. \nAssistance and information \nAn inadmissible FN who is unescorted may approach a POE claiming to be coming to Canada \nfor mutual legal assistance purposes. If so, and if no police officer is on site to meet the \nperson, the BSO should immediately contact the International Assistance Group, \nDepartment of Justice Canada, Ottawa, to request confirmation and advice before \nproceeding with the case (telephone: 613-957-4758 or 613-957-4768). \nInformation regarding persons arriving in Canada under the MLACMA is considered \nsensitive. Interception by unauthorized persons may endanger the safety of the escort \nofficer, inmate or other persons. It is imperative that all information regarding these cases \nbe transmitted through secure channels.  \n16.4 Court transfer orders \nA Canadian court can make a transfer order at the request of a foreign state. The Minister of \nJustice may approve the transfer of a sentenced inmate from a Canadian prison to a foreign \njurisdiction where the inmate is required to testify in a foreign court or to assist otherwise in \nthe investigation of a crime. The transfer order specifies the name and citizenship of the \ndetainee, the place in Canada at which the term of imprisonment is being served and the \ndate on or before which the detainee is expected to be returned to the original place of \nconfinement in Canada. \nA BSO at the PIL must refer for a secondary examination any person seeking to come into \nCanada on a transfer order of a Canadian court who is returned to Canada for completion of \ntheir sentence. \nPersons returning to Canada under the authority of a transfer order are subject to \nexamination.\n94 \n \nOfficers must check GCMS and assess whether the person is already subject to IRPA \nenforcement and should provide all relevant information to the CBSA Inland Enforcement \nofficer managing the case. If the person is not subject to IRPA enforcement, but may be \ninadmissible, officers should gather relevant evidence and forward it to an CBSA Inland \nEnforcement Office closest to the correctional facility.  \nFor further details on managing persons serving a sentence and IRPA enforcement options, \nrefer to ENF 22, Persons Serving a Sentence. \n16.5 Persons extradited to Canada from countries other than the U.S. \nWhen examining a person who is coming to Canada under extradition proceedings from a \ncountry other than the U.S., a BSO should obtain (at a minimum) the following information \nfor control purposes, either from the person being extradited or from the person’s escort: \nStatus  \nRequired Information  \nCanadian citizen \n person’s name \n proof of citizenship \nPermanent \nresident \n person’s name \n date of birth \n country of citizenship \n date permanent resident status in Canada \nwas obtained \n place where the trial is to be held \nForeign national \n person’s name \n date of birth \n country of citizenship \n place of permanent residence \n place where the trial is to be held \nIf the extradited person is not a Canadian citizen, a BSO should forward a memorandum \ncontaining all information relevant to the person’s entry requirements (including a copy of a \nTRP, if applicable) to the CBSA inland enforcement office nearest the place where the trial is \nto be held, with a copy to the Director of Enforcement in that region. \n \n17 Examining persons who may be medically inadmissible \n17.1 FNs seeking entry for medical treatment\n95 \n \nWhen evaluating temporary resident applications for medical treatment in Canada, BSOs \nneed to assess both the health and good faith of the applicant. \nIf a FN has a medical condition that could pose a danger to the public health or safety of \nCanadian residents, the BSO will determine if the FN should submit to an Immigration \nMedical Examination (IME) to ensure their health condition does not render them \ninadmissible to Canada under A38(1)(a) or A38(1)(b). Once the medical exam is performed, \nthe results are sent to IRCC Migration Health Branch (MHB) who will issue an opinion \nregarding potential inadmissibility under A38(1). \nWhen requesting a medical admissibility opinion, CBSA officers will refer the request to \nIRCC.MHBIMPN-RITDMDGMS.IRCC@cic.gc.ca. The request must include the following \ninformation:  \n \nRequest is for an IRCC MHB opinion of medical admissibility under IRPA.  \n \nClient details such as full name, DOB, POB, UCI, etc.  \n \nA narrative articulating the nature of the request.  \n \nSigned Medical Consent and Authorization form from the client to allow sharing of \nmedical information with IRCC.  \nMHB will offer a medical admissibility opinion based on the information provided, normally \nwithin three business days. The medical admissibility opinion may be used as evidence to \nsupport an A44(1) report and subsequently a finding of inadmissibility under A38(1) at an \nadmissibility hearing at the ID. \nIf an applicant is seeking medical treatment that would cause displacement on a waiting list \nfor Canadians, the application should be refused under A38(1)(c). \nPersons coming to Canada for medical treatment are expected to produce evidence of an \nagreement with the treating physicians and institutions that clearly indicates the medical \ncondition being treated, the proposed course of treatment and arrangements for payment. \nThe person must satisfy the BSO at Immigration Secondary that all associated expenses, \nincluding travel and accommodations costs, will be discharged without resulting in any cost \nto Canadian health or social services. \nApplicants who provide satisfactory evidence that they will pay the costs of their treatment \n(usually through an agreement with the Canadian treating physician and medical institution) \nand who meet all other requirements for temporary residence, do not require a TRP to enter \nCanada. \nWhere it is determined that the applicant’s circumstances and ability to pay have changed \nsince the letter of agreement was issued, the officer may ask for evidence that the care-\nprovider in Canada is aware of the new circumstances and that payment arrangements are \nnot affected. \nA FN who cannot satisfy the BSO that they will be able to pay for medical services and \ntreatment may be inadmissible under A39.  \nFor additional information, see ENF 5, Writing 44(1) Reports, for more information on \nprocedures for dealing with A44(1) reports on inadmissible persons. See also ENF 2,\n96 \n \nEvaluating Inadmissibility, for more information on determining inadmissibility as well as \nENF 1, Inadmissibility. \nPursuant to section 22 of the Canada/Quebec Accord, Quebec’s prior consent is required \nwith respect to foreign visitors entering that province to receive medical treatment. \nForeign nationals who are coming to receive medical care treatment in a Quebec public \nhealth facility must apply for and obtain a Quebec acceptance certificate (CAQ). There are \nno situations where a foreign national would be exempt of this obligation. \nFor more information on this exemption, please refer to section 2.3 Programme de séjour \ntemporaire pour traitement médical of the Guide des procédures d’immigration of the MIFI \n(available only in French). \nFor information on FNs coming to Canada for the purpose of giving birth, please refer to \nIRCC guidelines. \n17.2 FNs living with HIV/AIDS and the excessive demands criteria \nIt is IRCC’s policy that persons with HIV/AIDS do not represent a danger to public health. \nTherefore, a FN with HIV/AIDS seeking entry into Canada would not, in the absence of \ncontrary evidence, be inadmissible pursuant to A38(1) and the BSO would not normally \nrequest a medical examination based on concerns about danger to public health or safety. \nHowever, persons living with HIV/AIDS may be medically inadmissible if they have an \nassociated medical condition that is considered a public health risk such as active \ntuberculosis. \nAnother concern is the excessive demand that may be placed on health or social services by \nany applicant experiencing severe or chronic illness. As with any other FN making \napplication to enter Canada, persons with HIV/AIDS would not normally be expected to \nplace a demand on health services. It is therefore departmental policy that a diagnosis of \nHIV/AIDS is not in itself a barrier to visiting Canada. When making a determination, BSOs \nshould only consider whether it is likely that the person will require hospitalization during \ntheir visit. The carrying of medication used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS is not grounds for \ndenying temporary residence.  \n \n18 Options for dealing with inadmissibility and incomplete \nexaminations \nA BSO at Immigration Secondary has a variety of options available when an examination \ncannot be completed or when a person is believed to be inadmissible. \n18.1 Further examination \nSituations or circumstances may arise where an adjournment is necessary to ensure a \nproper examination by a BSO in Immigration Secondary. For example, a BSO may require\n97 \n \nan interpreter or additional documents, information or evidence to determine admissibility. \nThe facilities may be inadequate or personnel may not be readily available to deal with \nvolumes. \nA23 authorizes a BSO to allow a person to enter Canada for the purpose of further \nexamination or for an admissibility hearing. R43(2) clarifies that persons who are authorized \nto enter Canada for further examinations do not acquire temporary resident or PR status.  \nMandatory conditions to be imposed \nWhere the BSO adjourns an examination under A23, R43(1) requires that mandatory \nconditions be imposed: \n \nto report in person at the time and place specified for the completion of the \nexamination or the admissibility hearing; \n \nto not engage in any work in Canada; \n \nto not attend any educational institution;  \n \nto report in person to an officer at a POE, if the person withdraws their application to \nenter Canada; and \n \nto comply with all requirements imposed on them by an order or regulation made \nunder the Emergencies Act or the Quarantine Act. \nPersons whose examination has been deferred and who fail to report as required for \ncontinuation of their examination may be subject to an arrest warrant for examination. It is \ntherefore very important that officers consider all relevant information and gather contact \ninformation prior to issuing A23. Remarks in the Examination’s Notes tab should be done \nwithout delay and explain the BSO’s reasoning for furthering the examination. In addition, \nFNs may also be reportable for non-compliance under A41(a) and R43(a) and the MD has \nthe competency to issue the applicable removal order under R228(1)(c)(i). The A44 report \ncannot be concluded until the person is encountered at some point in the future. Therefore, \nBSOs should send the file to their nearest Inland Enforcement Office once the warrant is \nissued.  \nFor more details, refer to shift briefing bulletin 2021-HQ-AC-07-16. \n18.2 Direction to leave Canada \nR40 states that an officer who is unable to examine a person who is seeking to enter \nCanada at a POE shall direct the person in writing to leave Canada. This does not apply to \nprotected persons or refugee claimants. The decision to direct a person to leave is \napplicable in cases where a person cannot be properly examined (such as physical \nimpairment due to alcohol or drugs). \nThe BSO must serve a copy of the Direction to Leave form [BSF 503] on the person \nconcerned and on the transporter who brought them to Canada. \nThe direction ceases to have effect when the person appears again at a POE and a BSO \nproceeds to examine the person. \nPlease consult the CBSA Wiki for GCMS functional guidance.\n98 \n \n18.3 Direct back \nR41 authorizes an officer to direct a FN seeking to enter Canada from the U.S. to return to \nthe U.S. if: \n \nno officer is able to complete an examination; \n \nthe Minister is not available to consider, under A44(2), a report made with respect to \nthe person;  \n \nan admissibility hearing cannot be held by the Immigration Division; or \n \nthe FN is prohibited from entering Canada by an order or regulation made by the \nGovernor in Council under the Emergencies Act or the Quarantine Act. \nSee section 18.4 of this manual on how and when to use the direct back policy for refugee \nclaimants at land POE under exceptional circumstances. \nThe FN will be issued a Direction to Return to the United States form [BSF 505] document. \nThe date and location of the examination, the Minister’s consideration of the A44(1) report, \nthe admissibility hearing, or when an officer will be able to examine their application to \nenter Canada once they are no longer prohibited from entering Canada by an order or \nregulation made by the Governor in Council under the Emergencies Act or the Quarantine \nAct are specified on the document. \nA person who has been directed to return to the U.S. pending an admissibility hearing by \nthe Immigration Division and who seeks to come into Canada for reasons other than to \nappear at that hearing, is considered to be seeking entry. If such a person remains \ninadmissible for the same reasons, and if a member of the Immigration Division is not \nreasonably available, the person may be again directed to return to the U.S. to wait until a \nmember of the Immigration Division is available. In these circumstances it is not necessary \nto write a new A44(1) report. \nThe BSO at Immigration Secondary should bear in mind that time may be required by the \nperson, to allow for travel to the location where they must appear before a member of the \nImmigration Division and that the circumstances may warrant authorizing the person entry, \nat an appropriate time in advance of the scheduled date.  \nBSOs should write detailed remarks without delay in the Examination’s Notes tab in GCMS \nconcerning the reasons for issuing a direct back. \nPlease consult the CBSA Wiki for GCMS functional guidance. \n18.4 Direct back and refugee claimants arriving at the land POEs from \nthe U.S. \nAll efforts should be made to process refugee claimants at the time of arrival. Refugee \nclaimants may only be directed back to the U.S. under exceptional circumstances. In cases \nwhere a direct back must occur for an exceptional circumstance, approval must be obtained \nfrom Travellers Branch, National Headquarters. Also, the Record of Direct Back must be \ncompleted and emailed to the Border Operations Directorate, Travellers Branch pursuant to \nthe instructions provided below. It should be noted that lack of interpretation services\n99 \n \nshould not be considered “exceptional” or used as the basis for directing refugee claimant \nback to the U.S. See section 8.4 of this manual for guidelines on telephone interpretation. \nProcedures to be followed before directing a refugee claimant back to the \nU.S. \nBefore directing a refugee claimant back to the U.S., BSOs are to fully consider the following \noptions: \n \nIf a BSO is not readily available to take the claim, notify the superintendent that \nit may be necessary to request assistance from another POE or to call an officer \nin on overtime.  \n \nComplete the Initial Refugee Claimant Assessment (IRCA) process to determine \nwhether the claimant is low risk and may be authorized to enter for further \nexamination. \n \nIf the claimant is not considered to be low risk, the full refugee intake process \nshould be completed. \n \nDetain the refugee claimant, if grounds exist. If arrangements cannot be made to \nconduct the front-end security screening examination and grounds exist, the \nclaimant may be detained according to current detention procedures. \nDecision to direct a refugee claimant back to the U.S. under exceptional \ncircumstances \nExceptional circumstances are defined as situations where all of the procedures outlined \nabove have been considered and where an examination still cannot be conducted. \nExceptional circumstances could also include sudden or unexpected surges of people or a \nsituation where the health, security or well-being of the refugee claimant would be \nsignificantly impacted and it would not be appropriate for the claimant to wait at the POE or \nbe detained. In 2020-2021, this was the case due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe direct back procedure should not be used in the case of an unaccompanied minor. \nDirect back procedure for refugee claimants under exceptional \ncircumstances \nOnce a BSO has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, the instructions for \ndirecting the claimant back to the U.S., pursuant to R41, are as follows: \n1. The BSO must obtain approval from the POE Superintendent before directing a \nrefugee claimant back to the U.S. \n2. Approval must be obtained from the Duty Executive, Operations Branch, before \nallowing a direct back to occur. The Duty Executive can be contacted via the Border \nOperations Centre (613-960-6001). \n3. The refugee claimant must be provided with a scheduled appointment to return to \nthe POE to have their refugee eligibility examination completed. \n4. The Refugee Claim Application in GCMS should be completed and a further \nexamination event should be created reflecting the details and date upon which the \nclaimant is scheduled  to return to the POE.\n100 \n \n5. The refugee claimant should be issued a Direction to Return to the United States \nform [BSF 505] stating the date, time and location of the scheduled examination and \nthe claimant is to be advised accordingly. At the POE where local arrangements are \nin place or can be made, the BSO or Superintendent should seek assurances from \nthe U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the claimant can be made available to \nreturn to Canada for their scheduled examination. \n6. The BSO must complete the attached Record of Direct Back Template (Appendix C) \nfor all refugee claimants that are directed back to the U.S. The template must be \nsent within one business day of the direct back or on the next business day for late \narrivals with the subject line reading “direct back” to the following two email \naddresses: \no \nOPS_TRAVELLERS-VOYAGEURS@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca \no \nCBSA.Traveller_Immigration_Prog-Prog_immigration_voyageurs.ASFC@cbsa-\nasfc.gc.ca \n18.5 Detention for examination \nPursuant to A55(3)(a), a PR or FN may, on entry into Canada, be detained if the BSO at \nImmigration Secondary considers it necessary to do so in order for the examination to be \ncompleted. \nFor detailed procedures on A55(3)(a), refer to ENF 7, Immigration Investigations and IRPA \ns. 55 Arrest/Detention. \n18.6 Allowing the withdrawal of an application to enter Canada  \nAllowing a person to withdraw their application to enter Canada is an option a BSO at \nImmigration Secondary has to permit a FN, whom the BSO believes is inadmissible or if the \nFN took a wrong turn and had no intention to come to Canada, to leave Canada. \nIf a BSO examines a FN seeking entry and the person is believed to be inadmissible, the \nofficer may allow the person to voluntarily withdraw their application to enter the country \nand leave Canada. \nUnder R42, the officer who examines a FN who is seeking to enter Canada and who has \nindicated that they want to withdraw their application to enter Canada shall allow the FN to \nwithdraw their application, unless R42(2) applies. \nR42(2) provides that a FN shall not be allowed to withdraw their application to enter Canada \nwhere a report under A44(1) is being prepared or has been prepared, unless the Minister \ndoes not make a removal order or refer the report to the ID for an admissibility hearing. In \nother words, once an officer writes an A44(1) report, the allowed to leave option may only \nbe exercised at the MD level. \nBefore writing an inadmissibility report under A44(1), officers should determine whether the \nobjectives of the IRPA are better served by allowing the person to voluntarily withdraw their \napplication to enter Canada pursuant to R42. \nIf a person is allowed to leave Canada voluntarily, officers should counsel the person as \nfollows:\n101 \n \n \ninform the person why they are believed to be inadmissible; \n \ninform the person that if they leave Canada voluntarily, they will be free to seek \nentry to Canada once the factor causing inadmissibility has been overcome; and \n \ninform the person of the possible consequences of an A44(1) report, including the \npossibility of an admissibility hearing and/or a removal order being made against \nthem. \nIf a person is allowed to leave Canada voluntarily, the officer or MD must give the person an \nAllowed to Leave Canada form (IMM 1282B). \nR42(3) provides that FNs who are allowed to withdraw their application to enter Canada \nmust appear without delay at a POE to verify their departure from Canada. \nSometimes a person who is being allowed to withdraw their application to enter Canada is \nauthorized to enter Canada pursuant to A23 when a flight is not immediately available to \naffect their departure. \nNo matter the situation, BSOs should write detailed remarks in the Notes tab of the \nExamination in GCMS without delay. \nR37(c) provides that the examination of the FN ends only when the officer verifies their \ndeparture from Canada. \nPlease consult the CBSA Wiki for GCMS functional guidance: \n￭ \nAllowed to Leave Canada by MD \n￭ \nAllowed to Leave Canada by Officer \n19 Examinations that may lead to prosecution \nImmigration examinations relate to admissibility and, for the most part, the infractions \nidentified during this process result in enforcement actions leading to removal. During the \nexamination, BSOs may encounter serious offences that may warrant further investigation \nfor the purposes of a criminal prosecution. It is important that BSOs are aware that the \nadmissibility determination process does not include gathering evidence as part of a criminal \ninvestigation. \nThis section also addresses the arrest of Canadian citizens who are found to have committed \nan offence under IRPA. \n19.1 Procedures \nThe BSO must make a determination of admissibility. In order to make a determination, \nBSOs collect information under the regulatory examination process. After the admissibility \ndecision has been reached and if the BSO suspects a criminal offence under A117 to A131 \nhas occurred, the officer must advise the person of their rights under the Charter and \ncaution them before proceeding with any further examination including questioning the \nindividual. Criminal Investigations Division (CID) should also be contacted before further \nexamination.\n102 \n \nGenerally, if information is lawfully collected for the purpose of an admissibility examination, \nthat information can be subsequently used as part of a criminal investigation or prosecution. \nThe BSO must ensure they can clearly articulate to the court when the information was \nobtained for the regulatory purposes to make the determination of admissibility and when \nthe officer started to examine further for evidence of a potential criminal offence while \nensuring the individual’s rights were not violated. The officer must be able to articulate how \neach question asked is relevant to their role in making an admissibility determination and \nthat the individual was advised of their rights under the Charter and was cautioned once the \nBSO believed a criminal offence had occurred. Failure to do so can have a negative impact \non the outcome of the case. For this reason it is imperative that the BSO take detailed \nnotes. This is particularly important if the person willingly provides information after being \ncautioned. \nIn accordance with any accepted local procedures, and in consultation with their \nsuperintendent, BSOs should continue to use their discretion in deciding when to refer a \ncase to the CID or local police for investigation but they must also be aware of the potential \nconsequences of continuing an examination after the administrative process is complete and \nonce a criminal offence is suspected. When in doubt, it is best to advise the individual of \ntheir rights and caution them regarding making any statements  to protect the admissibility \nof those statements should the case end up being referred to CID. \nRefer to section 4.1 of this manual for legislative powers and authorities to examine and \nseize. \n19.2 Criminal Code offence discovered by a designated officer \nSubsection 163.4(1) of the Customs Act authorizes the President to designate any officer for \nthe purposes of Part VI.1 of the Act; this authority is usually delegated to the Regional \nDirector General.  These officers are referred to as “designated officers”. Subsection \n163.5(1) of the Customs Act states that a designated officer, when at a customs office and \nperforming the normal duties of an officer, or acting in accordance with section 99.1 has, in \nrelation to a criminal offence under any other Act of Parliament, the powers and obligations \nof a peace officer under sections 495 to 497 of the Criminal Code, and subsections 495(3) \nand 497(3) of that Act apply to the designated officer as if they were a peace officer. It \nshould be noted that this does not apply to criminal offences under the Customs Act or the \nImmigration Refugee Protection Act, as the expanded authorities under subsection 163.5(1) \nof the Customs Act are not required for an officer to arrest for offences under those Acts. \nAs soon as a designated officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has \ncommitted an offence under the Criminal Code or any other Act of Parliament, the \nexamination under IRPA is to be temporarily suspended. \nA superintendent should be consulted immediately. The CID, the police agency of \njurisdiction or the Regional Intelligence Officer must also be contacted for further guidance \nas soon as possible. The officer may arrest the individual in accordance with section 495 of \nthe Criminal Code. The detainee must be immediately advised of their right to retain \ncounsel and cautioned regarding making statements. PRs and FNs are also to be informed of \ntheir right to have the nearest representative of their government notified of their arrest \nand detention as per the Vienna Convention.\n103 \n \nThe immigration examination resumes once the person is released and taken to a CBSA \nofficer. For further information, refer to sections 19.5 and 19.6 below. \n19.3 Arrest and caution \nSubject to the limitations set out in subsection 495(2) of the Criminal Code, the person may \nbe arrested under subsection 495(1) if there are reasonable grounds to believe he or she \nhas committed an offence. The individual must then be promptly informed of the reasons for \nthe arrest and of the right to retain counsel as well as be cautioned regarding making \nstatements. PRs and FNs must also be informed of their right to have the nearest \nrepresentative of their government notified of their arrest and detention as per the Vienna \nConvention. Refer to the CBSA Enforcement Manual, Part 6, Chapter 1, Arrest and Detention \nfor the policy and procedures.  \n19.4 Canadian citizens \nOn rare occasions, evidence of a Canadian citizen committing an offence under IRPA will be \nuncovered at the POE. Should the BSO decide to proceed with an arrest, they are to caution \nand arrest the Canadian under the authority of subsection 495(2) of the Criminal Code as \nnoted in section 19.3 of this manual. \n19.5 Note-taking \nAs officers may be required to provide testimony in court proceedings several months after \na referral to the CID or police has been made, diligent note taking is essential to establish \nwhy certain actions were taken and what the predominant purpose of the officer’s actions \nwas at the time. It is important to note that it is the court’s interpretation of the BSO’s \ntestimony of the events supported by the notes that will determine whether the \ninformation/evidence obtained during the administrative process is admissible in court. \nTherefore, notes should include the events leading to the referral to CID or the police and \nthe time the person was placed under arrest and advised of their rights and cautioned. \nComments and statements made by the subject must be recorded verbatim. Notes must \nalso identify the officers and superintendent involved in the case, including those implicated \nin the chain of custody. \nThe chain of custody, or continuity of evidence, must be ensured in order to meet the \nrigorous evidentiary standards applied in criminal courts. Material evidence should be \nremoved from the person’s possession and taken into custody immediately upon detection. \nThe seized evidence must be kept in view and under the control of the officer. When an \nassisting BSO watches over goods or evidence, this officer becomes part of the chain of \ncustody and could be called as a witness: therefore, the assisting BSO should also maintain \nnotes. Refer to the CBSA Enforcement Manual, Part 8, Chapter 1, Notebooks, for more \ninformation regarding the CBSA officers’ policy for use of the notebooks. \n19.6 Completing suspended examinations of FNs (refer to section 19.2) \nA BSO may encounter circumstances where it is appropriate to suspend the immigration \nexamination to allow a criminal process to proceed. The subject will be placed under arrest \nfor the offence and advised of their rights and cautioned. The BSO must also issue a warrant \nfor arrest pursuant to A55(1) with a Warrant for Arrest form [BSF499] and an Order of the\n104 \n \nCanada Border Services Agency to Deliver Inmate form [BSF498] pursuant to A59 in order \nto ensure that the examination is completed once the person is released after the criminal \nproceedings. Inland Enforcement Investigations must be informed to ensure effective follow \nup.  \nFor additional information, please refer to ENF 7, Immigration Investigations and IRPA s. 55 \nArrest/Detention.  \n20 Unauthorized border crossings \nA BSO who becomes aware that a person is attempting an unauthorized border crossing \nshould first notify the RCMP or police of jurisdiction. The primary responsibility for patrolling \nbetween the border rests with the RCMP. The CBSA Investigations Division should also be \nnotified. \nOfficers shall not attempt to stop persons fleeing to or from Canada in high-risk situations \n(e.g. to establish roadblocks to stop port runners or to participate in vehicle pursuits). In \nthese situations, officers are required to ensure that officer and public safety is maintained \n(e.g. open a lane and clear traffic from the area). \nSome points to remember are the following: \n \nBSO should not attempt to investigate an unauthorized border crossing and should \nrefer the unauthorized crossing to CID. \n \nBSOs shall follow the provision of the CBSA Directive on Use of Force and \nReporting and the CBSA SOP on Use of Force and Reporting, when they believe that \nthe use of force is justified in the course of administering or enforcing Program \nLegislation.   \n \nBSOs who are trained and certified in defensive tactics and are in possession of \ndefensive equipment are expected to manage situations up to such point that the \nBSO believes that the limit of their training and personal abilities has been attained. \nWhere these limits have been reached, the BSO shall permit the individual to \nproceed into Canada and immediately notify the police force of jurisdiction.  \n \nBSOs should use communication equipment to keep in contact with the POE, should \nthey require assistance. \n \nBSOs may consider requesting that the CID lay changes under A124 if an \ninvestigation determines that a person has eluded examination or entered Canada by \nimproper means. \n \nIf the BSO has sufficient information relating to the identity of the person who failed \nto appear for examination (e.g. examination started but person left POE before end \nof examination), and the person is a foreign national, BSO should also issue an \nimmigration arrest warrant for examination.  \n21 Media Cases \nWhen high-profile, contentious or sensitive cases are identified or are in the national media, \nBSOs must follow the procedures outlined below to inform NHQ. \n1. Inform and consult the immediate superintendent once it is suspected that the case \nmeets the criteria of a high-profile, contentious or sensitive case.\n105 \n \no \nMore information on the types of cases that are potentially high-profile is \navailable on IRCC’s Handling high-profile, complex, sensitive or contentious \ncases page. \no \nSuperintendents are also to report significant events, as outlined in the \nIncident Reporting Criteria, to the Border Operations Centre (BOC) while \nrespecting regional reporting protocols that are in place. \n2. Inform NHQ by sending an email that includes \no \n“High-Profile Case” followed by the subject’s last name and given name in \nthe subject line. \no \nThe applicant’s name, date of birth, file number and/or client identification \nnumber (if applicable). \no \nA case chronology, including case-specific details and a summary of the \nreason(s) the case is, or has the potential to be, high-profile. \no \nAny action taken or recommendations to resolve the case (if applicable); and \no \nAny other pertinent information. \no \nThe following distribution list: \n \nImmigration Program Manager (overseas cases) or manager or \nsupervisor (inland cases); \n \nNHQ-NAT-High-Profile-Haut-profil@cic.gc.ca (which includes NHQ-\nCommunications-Cases@cic.gc.ca ; the current Director General and \nSenior Director of Case Management Branch and the Office of the \nAssistant Deputy Minister); \n \nCase-Management, CBSA-NHQ case-management@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca \n \nNat_National_Security_Coordination@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca; and \n3. Use the Single Reporting Tool (SRT) to report a significant event to the BOC and \nfollow up, as necessary, to keep information up to date and ensure case notes are \ndetailed and able to feed into briefing documents, if required. \n4. Refer any communication-related responsibilities to NHQ Communications. Any cases \nthat have implications in Canada (including those cases that initiate overseas) also \nneed to be coordinated with Communications in the affected region. \n22 Disembarkation and Roving Teams (DART) \n22.1 DART overview \nDisembarkation screening refers to the rapid verification by BSOs that airline passengers \npossess travel documents. Under A15(3), an officer has the authority to board and inspect a \nvehicle and to examine and record documents carried by a person on board a vehicle. \nThe purpose of screening disembarking passengers is to identify and segregate persons not \nin possession of passports or travel documents from the normal flow of passengers. In \naddition, inadmissible travellers who may pose a risk or who are otherwise inadmissible can \nbe identified through intelligence-based indicators such as identified trends, lookouts and \nAdvanced Passenger Information/Passenger Name Record (API/PNR) information received \nfrom the National Targeting Centre’s (NTC) Targeting Travellers unit (TT). \nDisembarkation screening also enables a BSO to identify which airline has carried an \nimproperly documented passenger to Canada and ensures that the CBSA can levy \nadministration fees and removal costs against a liable transporter. When two international \nflights arrive within a brief period of time, for example, passengers from each flight may\n106 \n \nintermingle at the PIL. This can make it difficult to determine which carrier brought an \nimproperly documented passenger to Canada and to properly assess liability. \nOn-board inspections, disembarkation screening, pre-PIL roving and post-PIL activities are \npart of the examination continuum. At these preliminary checks, the DART officer does not \ndo a full examination and does not make a decision to authorize or deny entry. Instead, the \nofficer verifies that a passenger has the necessary documentation and refers undocumented \nand suspected inadmissible persons to Immigration Secondary for an in-depth examination. \nThis does not usurp the authority of the PIL as DART referrals do not bypass the PIL. \n22.2 DART mandate and objectives \nAs a part of the CBSA’s mandate to manage access to Canada, the mandate of DART is to \nincrease the CBSA’s capacity to: \n \nidentify improperly documented or otherwise inadmissible FNs;  \n \nassociate improperly documented FNs to commercial transporters to promote \ncompliance with the CBSA’s administrative programs;  \n \nidentify and interdict individuals who pose a threat to the health, safety and security \nof Canada including persons who pose a security threat, serious criminals, human \nsmugglers, human and international rights violators, and persons engaged in trans-\nnational organized crime; and \n \nanalyze and contribute to the intelligence pool on illegal migration trends and \npatterns. \nThe objectives of DART are to: \n \nuse intelligence, trend and statistical analysis and other innovative passenger \nassessment techniques (i.e., API/PNR referrals) to improve secondary examination \nreferrals; \n \nidentify, intercept and control passengers who pose a danger, security threat, or are \na flight risk; \n \nmonitor and promote transporter compliance by linking undocumented persons with \ntransporters; \n \nassist in the collection of evidence for immigration admissibility reports and \nprosecutions; \n \nassist in the collection, analysis and dissemination of intelligence related to travel \nroutes used by illegal migrants and smuggling networks; \n \npromote cooperation, coordination and the exchange of information with partner \nagencies; \n \nmaintain a professional, responsive and visible presence to deter inadmissible \npersons from entering Canada; and \n \nremove fraudulent documents from circulation thereby preventing their future \nfraudulent use. \n22.3 DART activities \nDART activities can vary from one POE to another due to operational requirements, differing \npriorities and other considerations. Specific DART activities can include:\n107 \n \n \ninspection of airline passengers for possession of passports and travel documents \nand required visas; \n \nsearches of aircraft for discarded or hidden documentation; \n \nsearches of Customs Controlled Areas (CCA) for discarded or abandoned \ndocumentation; \n \nseizure of documents; \n \nroving in designated CCA to detect human smugglers and persons discarding \ndocuments; \n \ncompleting certain examinations and case files on high-risk cases such as suspected \nhuman smugglers; \n \ncompilation and maintenance of intelligence data, statistics and daily logs; \n \ninternal information-sharing within the CBSA (local office, other POEs, Criminal \nInvestigations intelligence offices, overseas liaison officers [LO]); \n \nexternal information-sharing (Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Global Affairs \nCanada (GAC), Office of the Solicitor General, airlines) depending on specific \nagreement with each partner; \n \ntargeting and passenger assessment of flights; \n \nestablishing transporter liability; \n \ninterviewing passengers at Immigration Secondary; \n \ncollection and analysis of officer case notes;  \n \nGCMS and ICES searches/queries; \n \nuse of internal communications systems; and \n \nanalysis of statistical and other relevant records. \nAlthough DART officers are BSOs, their primary function is to perform DART activities. When \ncircumstances permit, however, or when a superintendent requires emergency support, \nDART officers should offer their assistance to the on-site superintendent. \nFor more information on the Customs Controlled Areas, please refer to CBSA Enforcement \nManual part 6, chapter 9. \nMinimal delay to travelling public \nDisembarkation screening by DART teams should be completed as quickly and efficiently as \npossible. To ensure that the bona fide travelling public is not unduly disrupted or delayed, \nthe POE superintendent should ensure that an appropriate number of officers are assigned \nto screen passengers, taking into consideration the different sizes of aircraft and passenger \nvolumes. \n22.4 Intelligence-based targeting of airline flights \nDART officers propose and confirm flights to be screened with their on-site superintendent \nbased on tactical intelligence identifying flights and persons of interest to the CBSA. \nDetermining which flights to target for disembarkation screening is based on the following: \n \nlookouts and intelligence information; \n \nadvance passenger information received from NTC’s TT unit;  \n \ntrend analysis; \n \nflights of heightened interest to the CBSA; \n \npoint of embarkation;\n108 \n \n \nnumber of passengers on board; \n \nsize of the aircraft; \n \nestimated time of arrival of the next flight to be monitored; and \n \nnumber of officers available to conduct disembarkation checks. \nWhile all carriers should be the target of periodic disembarkation screening, those carriers \nwith a history of carrying undocumented passengers may be subject to more frequent \nscreening. \nSpecific case information is received and analyzed by DART teams through: \n \nin-person client interviews at Immigration Secondary; \n \nofficer case notes; \n \nFOSS history checks, GCMS searches and SSI reports; \n \nreports provided by the CBSA’s Immigration Intelligence Branch; \n \nstatistical reports; \n \nliaison officers located around the world who provide information on illegal migration \nand smuggling trends; \n \nNTC’s TT officer that provides API and PNR information on arriving passengers; and \n \nother agencies such as the RCMP. \nIn a reciprocal manner, DART officers contribute to the intelligence pool with trend and \nillegal traffic information that is used by the liaison officer network to interdict inadmissible \ntravellers abroad and deny them boarding on flights to Canada. Information gathered from \nDART intercepts is entered in the Support System for Intelligence (SSI) that is used by the \nCBSA’s intelligence officers in Canada and abroad to monitor and analyse illegal migration \nand human-smuggling trends. Additionally, DART officers ensure that suspected human \nsmugglers and others in possession of fraudulent documents are referred to the CID. Cases \nof potential human trafficking should be referred to the CID and Intelligence for further \ninvestigation and liaison with partners. \nIntelligence support \nThe DART officers provide an integral operational link within the CBSA’s intelligence and \nliaison officer networks overseas. These are major resources for DART teams and can \nprovide valuable assistance in identifying human smuggler routings. The two-way exchange \nof information also provides the opportunity to interdict inadmissible persons abroad and \ndeny them the opportunity to board flights to Canada. \nRegional intelligence officers can provide a variety of services, which may include: \n \ndocument examination training; \n \ndocument analysis; \n \nemerging trend information; and \n \nSSI analytical reports. \nLiaison officers are located in key locations around the world and play an integral part of the \nscreening, identification and interception of improperly documented persons trying to enter \nCanada. Together with DART officers, they form part of the continuum of the passenger \nassessment process that begins abroad and continues on arrival in Canada. They are both \nkey elements in Canada’s multiple-border strategy.\n109 \n \nAPI/PNR liaison \nNTC’s Targeting Travellers unit uses advance passenger information to identify known \ninadmissible persons and passenger name records analysis to assess individuals who may \npose a potential risk prior to their arrival in Canada. This enables DART officers to use their \nlimited resources more strategically to target flights and persons of interest. \nThis is key to the intelligence-based targeting of flights by DART officers. While NTC’s TT \nunit provide strategic information about the arrival of persons linked to terrorist \norganizations, criminal activity and other factors that render them inadmissible, DART acts \non this intelligence information to intercept inadmissible persons immediately on arrival. \nPassengers who pose security or flight risks can be quickly intercepted and maintained in a \ncontrolled environment pending their examination. \n22.5 DART procedures \nNotification to partners \nWith as much lead time as possible and in accordance with local procedures, DART officers \nshould notify partners such as Transport Canada and RCMP officials of the flights they \nintend to screen and of other pre-PIL roving activities. \nPre-disembarkation procedures \nDART officers should verify that proper communication (i.e., radio contact) has been \nestablished with the on-site superintendent before leaving the office to perform \ndisembarkation checks. Superintendent should remain in continual contact for updates, \nemergencies and requests for assistance. \nBoarding flights and gate checks \nDART officers should, whenever possible, be gate-side at least five minutes before the \nflight’s scheduled arrival time. \nDART members will then make a final decision as to which level of disembarkation check is \nto be performed. The airline representative must be advised of the level of disembarkation. \nFurthermore, a request should be made to the airline to ensure that an announcement is \nmade on board the flight to prepare the passengers (levels I and II only). This \nannouncement should clearly indicate to passengers that the CBSA will be doing a check to \nensure that they possess the necessary documentation to enter Canada and that they \nshould have their documentation ready for presentation. Only then will the disembarkation \nscreening proceed. \nDocument screening is conducted on board the aircraft, at a point as close to the exit of the \naircraft as possible, or wherever else deemed appropriate by the DART officer. Normally, \nofficers will proceed down the aisle and allow passengers whose documents have been \nverified to leave the aircraft.\n110 \n \nWhen boarding flights and conducting gate checks, DART officers should be mindful of the \nfact that they are in an excellent position to pass information along to the officers at the \nPIL. If a DART check of a passenger does not turn up any immigration concerns, but strong \nindicators are present that the particular traveller may be of interest to Customs, DART \nofficers should make every effort to inform the officer at the PIL or an officer at Customs \nSecondary examination of these indicators to assist them in completing their examination. \nLevel I (boarding the flight): A minimum of two officers is required to do a check at this \nlevel. \nDART members will conduct level-one disembarkation checks in the following manner: \n \nin a two-aisle aircraft, officers should stay parallel to each other in their \nrespective aisles while doing document checks; \n \nin a single aisle aircraft, at least one officer checks documents on the left side of \nthe aircraft and another officer, in single file with all other officers, completes the \nright side of the aircraft; and \n \nin a Boeing 747, at least one officer proceeds to “the bubble,” while another \nofficer checks documents of the passengers in first class. Once those sections \nhave been completed, officers then proceed to economy class. It is preferable \nthat at least three officers check this type of aircraft. \nThe officers inspect passports, travel documents and visas for authenticity. If any concerns \narise regarding a particular document, the document may be held for further examination. \nIf a person is suspected to be improperly documented, without documentation or otherwise \ninadmissible, they will be instructed to remain seated, and their documents will be held. In \nthis instance, the flight attendant should be approached to determine if the passenger is \ntravelling alone. If confirmed, the disembarkation check can be resumed. If another person \naccompanied the passenger, the documents of that passenger should be held as well. A \nrequest can be made to the flight attendant to ensure that the passenger and their \ntravelling companion(s) remain seated until the completion of the check. \nAirlines may be requested to hold persons on board an aircraft under the authority of \nA148(1)(b) and R261. \nAfter the disembarkation check has been completed, the officer will: \n1. search the improperly documented passenger’s seat, any companion’s seat and the \nimmediate vicinity, including washrooms, to locate any documentation that may be \nhidden or discarded; \n2. determine if the passenger is sitting in their originally assigned seat. If the person is \nnot in their originally assigned seat, search that area as well; \n3. complete a BSF 453 form confirming the passenger’s presence (see section on \nimproperly documented passengers below for procedures on completing the BSF 453 \nform); and \n4. inform the flight director or crew of the conclusion of the check and thank them for \ntheir assistance. \nUpon completion of the disembarkation check, DART members will:\n111 \n \n1. escort the improperly documented arrival (IDA) to the crew counter in the PIL area \nso that the BSO at the PIL can complete the primary examination; \n2. once the primary examination is complete, escort the IDA to Immigration Secondary; \nand \n3. surrender any documentation and provide details of the case to the on-site \nsuperintendent . \nDART members will not be obligated to report any individuals, but when circumstances \nallow, DART officers will offer their assistance to the superintendent . \nIf no passengers require an escort, but documents have been held, DART officers will \nproceed to the Immigration Secondary examination area as soon as practicable to explain \nthe rationale for the seizure. If no documents have been held and there is no one to be \nescorted, team members can proceed directly to the next flight. \nLevel II (gate screening): A minimum of two officers is required to do a check at this \nlevel. \nDART members will conduct level-two disembarkation checks in the following manner: \n \nstand facing each other in the area where the boarding finger meets the terminal \nbuilding so that the disembarking passengers must pass between the officers; and \n \nconfirm that each person has a passport, or other required documentation. \nIf a passenger presents satisfactory documentation, the officer will allow the passenger to \nproceed to the PIL. \nDepending on the circumstances, the officer may instruct the passenger to wait in an area \nin plain view of at least one officer or continue to the PIL if one of the following situations \noccurs: \n \na passenger is not in possession of any travel documents; (in this instance, the flight \nattendant should be approached to determine if the passenger is travelling alone and \nto confirm their seat number. A document search should be conducted as in level I); \n \nthe officer is not satisfied with documents presented; or \n \nthe officer suspects the person to be inadmissible for any other reason. \nDART members will hold the document and, in the latter case, the passenger may be given \na receipt. If required, officers may ask for the assistance of airline personnel to maintain \nvisual contact with those persons instructed to wait. \nUpon completion of a disembarkation check, DART members will: \n1. escort the IDA to the crew counter in the PIL area so that the BSO at the PIL can \ncomplete the primary examination; \n2. once the primary examination is complete, accompany the IDA to Immigration \nSecondary; and \n3. surrender any documentation and provide details of the case to the on-site \nsuperintendent.\n112 \n \nDART members will not be obligated to report any individuals but, when circumstances \nallow, DART officers will offer their assistance to the superintendent. \nIf no passengers require an escort, but documents have been held, officers will proceed to \nImmigration Secondary as soon as practicable to explain the rationale for the seizure. \nHolding documents during the course of an examination does not constitute a seizure \naction. If the person is to depart the POE without their document (i.e. A23) or go into \ndetention, then it becomes a seizure and a BSF698 Notice of Seizure of Travel and/or \nIdentity Document(s) must be completed. \nIf no documents have been held, and there is no one to be escorted, team members can \nproceed directly to the next flight. \nLevel III (flight observation): A check at this level is performed when only one officer is \navailable. \nThis type of disembarkation screening is usually completed for low-risk flights, or when \nflight-arrival times are scheduled close together. This level of screening should also be \nconsidered when staffing levels prohibit officers from doing a level I, or level II \ndisembarkation check or, in a special circumstance, where surveillance is required. \nDART members will conduct this level of disembarkation check in the following manner:  \n1. Arrive at the gate five minutes prior to the estimated time of arrival of the flight. \n2. Inform the airline representative at the gate that an officer will be observing the \nflight and will not be requiring passengers to present their passports as they \ndisembark the aircraft. Also, they should specify that no announcement to the \npassengers should be made. \n3. Position themselves at a suitable distance, while ensuring that there is a clear view \nof the passenger flow from only the targeted flight. \n4. While observing the passengers, officers make suitable notes with regards to \npassengers who may be of interest to Immigration Secondary, and those \naccompanying them. \n5. Officers may ask individual passengers for documentation if there is a strong \nsuspicion that they may have improper documents, or no documents at all. \n6. Generally, it is most beneficial to follow the passengers down to the PIL area. This \nwill allow officers the opportunity for further observation and may prevent the \ndestruction or discarding of documentation in garbage containers or washrooms. \n7. If DART members are not proceeding directly to the Immigration Secondary area, \nthey should inform the on-site superintendent of the outcome of the disembarkation. \nIf required, DART members should relay any observations, their location and, if \nrequired, request assistance. \n8. At the earliest convenient break in disembarkation checks, go to the Immigration \nSecondary area to link any identified improperly documented arrivals with the carrier \nused to convey them to Canada, referring to the notes taken while observing the \ndisembarkation. \n9. If an undocumented passenger who the DART officer observed disembarking a flight \nis encountered in the Immigration Secondary area, the DART officer should complete \na BSF 453 form in accordance with procedures. If it is not practical to complete a \nBSF 453 form, the DART officer shall complete a statutory declaration as soon as \npossible.\n113 \n \nUpon completion of all necessary paperwork, DART members may now advise the on-site \nsuperintendent and proceed to the next flight planned for disembarkation. \nRoving DART activities \nIn addition to boarding flights and conducting gate checks, DART officers conduct roving \nexercises in the Customs Controlled Areas (CCA) area to identify other irregular activities \nsuch as the destruction or handing of documents to an escort or smuggler. DART officers \nengaged in pre-PIL roving may ask a BSO at the PIL for a specific person to be referred to \nImmigration Secondary. All DART referrals must pass through the PIL before being sent to \nImmigration Secondary. DART officers may engage in post-PIL activities when they have \ntargeted suspected human smugglers or other suspected inadmissible persons when new \ninformation has come to light after the passenger has cleared the PIL. \nImproperly documented passengers \nIf an improperly documented passenger is encountered, the officer should complete a \nConfirmation by Transporter Regarding Passenger(s) Carried form [BSF 453] at the earliest \nopportunity, either during disembarkation screening or as soon as the passenger has been \nescorted to the PIL and to the Immigration Secondary area. The local airline representative \nis also required to sign the form. If the representative refuses to sign, the DART officer \nshould place a note on the form accordingly. If it is not practical to complete a BSF 453 \nform, the DART officer shall complete a statutory declaration stating which flight the IDA \ndisembarked and outlining details about the lack of documentation. \nSince passengers normally have documents at the time of boarding, it is possible that \nimproperly documented passengers have hidden or destroyed their documents en route. \nUndocumented and other inadmissible passengers identified by DART must be presented at \nthe PIL for completion of Customs’ procedures and then escorted to the Immigration \nSecondary area for a complete examination. \nOnce IDAs have been identified, the DART member must ensure that: \n1. The appropriate areas of the aircraft are searched for documentation. \n2. The flight attendant and IDA have been queried as to any accompanying travellers; \n3. An airline representative has signed a BSF 453, when possible, for the passenger’s \narrival on their airline, and thanked for their assistance. \n4. Should a disembarkation check be performed and IDAs not be identified until their \narrival in Immigration or Customs Secondary, a request can be made to the airline \nstaff to visually identify that person and sign the BSF 453 form confirming their \npresence on their flight. Airline personnel cannot be compelled to sign a BSF 453 \nform. If airline personnel refuse to sign the BSF 453 form, a note should be made on \nthe form accordingly. If it is not practical to complete a BSF 453 form, the DART \nofficer shall complete a statutory declaration form [IMM 1392B]. \n5. The passenger is escorted, if necessary, to the Immigration Secondary area only \nafter they have cleared the PIL and the on-site superintendent is informed.  \n6. The CCA are checked for possible smugglers.\n114 \n \nReporting improperly documented passengers \nIn all cases where an improperly documented person has been detected, a BSO should: \n \ncreate a physical file ensuring that all secured documents are placed in the file; \n \ntake a photograph and fingerprints of the person and place copies in the file; \n \nplace copies of any documents found in the person’s possession in the file; \n \nensure that the passenger, their carry-on luggage and their checked luggage are \nsearched for documentation;  \n \nobtain a flight manifest when possible; \n \nclearly make a note on the file to indicate whether disembarkation screening has \nbeen done so that the person entering SSI data may check “yes” in the \ndisembarkation-screening field; and \n \nwhen entering SSI, check “yes” when asked “BSF 453 completed”, if applicable or \nadvise person entering SSI to do so. \nNote-taking \nDART officers should make note of the date, time and flight number in their notebooks or \nDART logs and record any information that may be relevant to the examination or \nprosecution of passengers. Keeping a written record of this information may be useful if the \nofficer is later called to testify in court. More information on officer note-taking is available \nin ENF 7, Immigration Investigations and IRPA s. 55 Arrest/Detention. \n22.6 Communication and cooperation with partners \nWithin the CBSA \nThe CBSA airport staff should keep one another, as well as their regional and national \nheadquarters, informed of DART developments. All such communications should be \nmaintained on the master regional and/or national headquarters’ file.  \nWith partners \nThe CBSA should consult Transport Canada, the RCMP and airline representatives at the \nPOE regarding any changes to disembarkation screening procedures that affect the \nconfiguration or operation of local facilities. Good communication among partners is \nessential to ensure cooperation and to minimize disruption of airport operations and delays \nto passengers.  \nDART officers should provide feedback to agencies and individuals who have initiated a \nDART action, while keeping in mind privacy legislation. This would include timely updates \nand outcomes from referrals, lookouts or general information that was provided to the DART \nteam. DART officers are encouraged to participate in orientation sessions with partners to \nfurther their understanding of the requirements of IRPA and its Regulations and to promote \ncooperation and the exchange of information. DART officers should be vigilant for \nopportunities to engage partners and participate in joint activities that would promote \nunderstanding and cooperation.\n115 \n \nWith the CBSA Immigration and Customs Enforcement Team (ICET)/ \nFlexible Response Team (FRT) \nThe CBSA has Immigration and Customs Enforcement Teams (ICET), also known as Flexible \nResponse Teams (FRTs), that occasionally operate pre-PIL in a manner similar to the CBSA’s \nDART teams. Both DART and ICET/FRT report to the Enforcement Division, which is run by \nthe Chief of Enforcement Operations. DART and ICET/FRT should make every effort to \ncommunicate on a daily basis to enhance the understanding of each other’s activities and to \ncoordinate the targeting of flights whenever possible. While DART and ICET/FRT have \ndifferent mandates and often target different flights, occasionally it will be operationally \nbeneficial for both teams to target the same flights. In these instances, both teams are \nrequired to coordinate their activities to enhance effectiveness and to minimize delays to the \ntravelling public. Among other things, ICET/FRT officers can assist with document \nverification and the search for documents aboard aircraft. \nWith airlines \nIt is essential that carriers understand and support disembarkation screening. POE \nsuperintendent should initiate and maintain frequent communications with local airline \nmanagers and clearly explain the purpose, procedures, and legislative foundation for \ndisembarkation screening.  \n22.7 Suspected human smugglers \nDART officers must accompany any suspected human smugglers to the PIL, then to the \nCustoms Secondary area for a thorough search. DART officers should identify themselves to \nthe BSO at the PIL and have the suspected human smuggler referred to both Immigration \nand Customs Secondary areas. \nIf evidence of human smuggling is discovered, the DART officer should immediately contact \nthe Criminal Investigations Division. The DART officer should then escort the person to \nImmigration Secondary for an immigration examination to determine citizenship and \nadmissibility. \nIf no evidence of human smuggling is discovered, the DART officer should accompany FNs \nto Immigration Secondary for examination to determine admissibility. Where the person \nprovides satisfactory verbal or documentary proof that they are a Canadian citizen, the BSO \nauthorizes the person to enter Canada at that point. It is not necessary to refer Canadian \ncitizens to Immigration Secondary if the BSO is satisfied that they have that status. \nDocumentation may be photocopied at Customs Secondary if necessary for further \ninvestigation or intelligence purposes. \nDART officers should notify their superintendent of all cases of suspected human smuggling \nand forward the case information to their Criminal Investigations office and regional \nintelligence office.\n116 \n \n22.8 Potential prosecutions \nDART officers are instrumental in identifying and gathering evidence to prosecute human \nsmugglers and traffickers. DART officers can play a key role in identifying, documenting, \nassessing, referring and assisting the RCMP or CBSA Criminal Investigations (depending on \nthe charge) in the laying of charges under IRPA and the Criminal Code. \nWhen there is a concern that charges should be considered, the BSO and/or the CBSA \nEnforcement Division should ensure that the CBSA Criminal Investigations and Intelligence \nare contacted and provided the details of the case. If the RCMP or CBSA Investigations \nconducts an investigation, the BSO and/or Enforcement Division should notify their \nsuperintendent or supervisor immediately. \nBSOs must be familiar with the heightened evidentiary requirements for prosecutions. \nDocuments for a criminal charge must be transferred and secured in a manner that is \nconsistent with the Canada Evidence Act. \nChronicled statements must comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. See \nsection 7.1 of manual ENF 12, Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing, relating \nto seizure, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \nWritten declarations should be completed and confirmed with the CBSA Investigator or the \ninvestigating RCMP officer. In situations where a statement is taken from a passenger, the \nresponsible officer should make every attempt to make the passenger available for the \nCBSA Investigator or the RCMP to interview. The declaration form is IMM 1392B. \n22.9 Interviewing Canadian citizens, PRs and persons registered under \nthe Indian Act \nDART officers must be cognizant of the change in the legal obligation of the individual when \ndealing with PRs, persons registered under the Indian Act and Canadian citizens and \nconduct the interview accordingly. Any statement made in response to an officer’s question \nmay be inadmissible in court if the person has not been given the proper cautioning prior to \nmaking the statement. \nDART officers should utilize these opportunities to inform partner agencies of Immigration \nSecondary’s role with respect to the specific case and the reasons for the actions taken. This \nmay include instances where no action is taken at that specific time. In these instances, \nDART officers must use the utmost care to ensure that the partner agency does not perceive \nImmigration Secondary as unwilling to act, but rather understands the inability to proceed \ndue to legal restrictions. \nWhen examining Canadian citizens, persons registered under the Indian Act and PRs, DART \nofficers must: \n1. confirm that the person concerned is in fact a Canadian citizen, persons registered \nunder the Indian Act or PR; \n2. receive permission from the person to conduct an interview, or to examine any \ndocumentation in their possession; \n3. collect any evidence that may link the person to an improperly documented arrival;\n117 \n \n4. if no evidence exists, then conclude the interview and thank them for their \ncooperation. If evidence of aiding and abetting exists, contact the CID immediately \nregarding the possible laying of charges. If the investigator attends, properly transfer \nall evidence relating to the charge to them. If the investigator does not wish to \nattend, then conclude the interview and thank the person for their cooperation; and \n5. in all cases where evidence exists,  a note should be added to GCMS detailing the \noccurrence. Also, all pertinent details should be relayed to Immigration Intelligence. \nEvidentiary requirements may place DART officers in the best position to complete reports \nof this nature. \n22.10 Training \nAll DART officers are required to be certified in Control and Defensive Tactics (CDT) training. \nIn addition, DART officers should generally have a minimum of one year’s experience as an \nexamination officer at the POE. This is to ensure that the officers are fully aware of the \nCBSA’s mandate, objectives, and policies and have a good working knowledge of operational \nprocedures, internal communication systems and statistical analysis and have recent \nexperience in interviewing clients.  \nDART officers also need to be aware of the principles and dynamics underlying and \nmotivating human behaviour, the influences of cultural differences, attitudes and behaviour \nand of departmental interviewing techniques. DART officers are usually required to complete \nup to two weeks’ training that may include courses on: \n \nDART orientation; \n \nairline responsibilities; \n \nfraud document detection; \n \nimmigration intelligence orientation; \n \nJetway training; \n \nevidence and criminal charges; \n \nCSIS profiles and interviewing techniques; \n \ncross-cultural awareness; \n \nanger management; \n \nfirst aid and CPR; \n \nnote-taking; \n \nCustoms Controlled Areas; and \n \nprocessing Indigenous travellers. \n22.11 Uniforms and appropriate protective and defensive equipment \nDART officers are required to wear their uniform while on duty in accordance with the \nUniform Policy. DART officers are also required to wear appropriate protective and defensive \nequipment including protective vests, OC spray, baton, handcuffs and duty firearm (where \napplicable) when working outside of the secure office setting. \nAny divergence from the standard uniform or equipment complement must be approved by \nlocal management and must be consistent with national guidelines.\n118 \n \n22.12 Statistical and intelligence reports \nFor audit purposes, POEs must keep an accurate record of the flights where a \ndisembarkation screening has taken place. The daily Action Reports should reflect the \nreason the flights were selected and the number of improperly documented passengers that \nwere identified. These reports may be used as evidence by the Transporter Obligations \nProgram’s Industry Compliance Unit when assessing the fees to be levied on carriers.  \nDART superintendents are responsible for compiling (from the daily Action Reports) a \nmonthly report of DART activity during the previous month. The monthly reports should \ncontain statistics on the number of disembarkations performed, the number of improperly \ndocumented FNs intercepted, as well as other DART actions initiated through referrals by \nIntelligence, NTC’s Targeting Travellers unit, the RCMP, the airlines or other sources.  \nNHQ Intelligence Branch will provide regular Intelligence reports to NHQ Ports and Border \nManagement, regional headquarters and airport DART superintendent about overseas \ninterceptions by Liaison Officers.  \n23 Alternate means of examination (AME)  \nR38 lists alternative means of examination that may be used instead of appearing at a POE \nfor an examination by a BSO. Refer to ENF 29, Alternative Means of Examination Programs \nfor more information. \n23.1 Trusted Traveller Programs (TTPs) \nTTPs are designed to expedite the border clearance process for pre-approved, low-risk \ntravellers. TTPs such as CANPASS, NEXUS, FAST and CDRP are available to U.S. and \nCanadian citizens and PRs. Successful applicants are issued authorizations to present in an \nalternate manner such as photo identity cards. Persons holding these authorizations are still \napplying for entry, but their examination will be expedited as background checks regarding \ncriminality and previous immigration and customs infractions have been completed. \nSee People Processing Manual, pt. 3 for more information on TTP. \n24 Advance passenger information (API) and passenger name \nrecord (PNR) \n24.1 API information \nThe Passenger Information (Customs) Regulations, as well as R269, obligate all commercial \nair carriers/commercial transporters to provide the CBSA with Advance Passenger \nInformation (API) relating to all persons on board, or expected to be onboard, the \ncommercial conveyance travelling to Canada prior to, and at, the time of departure from the \nlast point of embarkation of persons before the conveyance arrives in Canada, despite the \nfinal destination or transit port. The information is sent electronically. This enables the NTC-\nTT officers to conduct pre-arrival targeting, security, criminality and FOSS history checks \nand GCMS searches on the travellers prior to their arrival in Canada.\n119 \n \nAPI consists of the following data elements, mostly contained in the machine-readable \nzone (MRZ) of most passports and travel documents: \na) their surname, first name and any middle names, their date of birth, their citizenship or \nnationality and their gender; \n(b) the type and number of each passport or other travel document that identifies them and \nthe name of the country or entity that issued it; \n(c) their reservation record locator number, if any; \n(d) the unique passenger reference assigned to them, if any, by the person who is required \nto provide information or, in the case of a crew member who has not been assigned a \nunique passenger reference, notice of their status as a crew member; \n(e) any information about the person in a reservation system of the person who is required \nto provide information or in a reservation system of the representative of such a person; \nand \n(f) the following information about their carriage on board the commercial conveyance: \n(i) if the person is carried or is expected to be carried on board the commercial \nconveyance by air, the date and time of take-off from the last point of embarkation \nof persons before the commercial conveyance arrives in Canada or if the person is \ncarried or is expected to be carried on board the commercial conveyance by water or \nland, the date and time of departure from the last point of embarkation of persons \nbefore the commercial conveyance arrives in Canada, \niii) the last point of embarkation of persons before the commercial conveyance \narrives in Canada, \n(iii) the date and time of arrival of the commercial conveyance at the first point of \ndisembarkation of persons in Canada, \n(iv) the first point of disembarkation of persons in Canada, and \n(v) in the case of a commercial conveyance that carries persons or goods by air, the \nflight code identifying the commercial carrier and the flight number. \nThe API data elements are captured at the time of check-in when the machine-readable \nzone of the passport or travel document is swiped or entered manually. \n24.2 PNR information  \nThe Passenger Information (Customs) Regulations, as well as R269, obligate all commercial \nair carriers/commercial transporters to provide the CBSA with Passenger Name Record \n(PNR) information relating to persons on board the commercial conveyance travelling to \nCanada at the time of departure from the last point of embarkation of persons before the \nconveyance arrives in Canada, despite the final destination or transit port. The information \nis sent electronically and is matched, in PAXIS, with the API data provided. This enables the\n120 \n \nNTC officers to conduct pre-arrival targeting, security, criminality and FOSS history checks \nand GCMS searches on the travellers prior to their arrival in Canada. \nThe PNR information available in a transporter’s reservation system can be extensive, and \nthe data elements captured will vary for each transporter. Some transporters do not have \nPNR systems in use for some flights and thus are not obligated to provide the data for those \nflights. \n24.3 Disembarkation and Roving Team (DART) \nPrior to a commercial vehicle’s arrival in Canada, the NTC-TT unit will analyse the API and \nPNR information, enter required lookouts in ICES, and ensure that the BSOs and the DART \nreceive detailed information on persons who may be inadmissible to Canada. The NTC-TT \nhave the decision-making ability to flag a person, prior to their arrival at the PIL, for referral \nto Immigration Secondary. \n25 Entering data on previously deported persons (PDP) into the \nCanadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) \nThe primary objective for entering data on PDPs into the CPIC is to enhance public safety \nand security by providing peace officers with the necessary information to form reasonable \ngrounds that the person may be arrested without a warrant, as per A55(2)(a). The CPIC-\nPDP database will equip peace officers across Canada with information that a FN has been \ndeported from Canada, has returned to Canada without authorization as required by A52(1) \nand, at the time of the person’s removal, there were reasonable grounds to believe that the \nperson is a danger to the public or is unlikely to appear. \nAfter a name is queried in the CPIC and it is a direct match to a person found in the PDP \ndatabase, the information on the CPIC will instruct law enforcement partners to contact the \nWarrant Response Centre (WRC) for further assistance.  \nInformation on individuals in the CPIC-PDP database originates from FOSS/GCMS. For more \ninformation on this subject, see ENF 10, Removals. \n25.1 POE procedures for completing the Authorization to Return to \nCanada (ARC) application \nThe completion of Authorization to Return to Canada (ARC) applications is normally the \nresponsibility of visa offices. However, on occasion, the POE is required to deal with \nindividuals where completion of an ARC application is necessary. Therefore, Authorization to \nReturn to Canada application functionality in GCMS is accessible at POE and the authority to \ngrant or deny the ARC has been designated at the POE to the Chief of Operations level (see \nIL 3, CIC IDD: Instrument of Designation and Delegation, item 88). \nThe Authorization to Return to Canada application functionality is used to record the \nprocessing and disposition (approval or denial) of an ARC, regardless of the type of removal \norder (i.e., exclusion order cases where written authority is required). When granting an \nARC, an ARC application must be completed in GCMS.\n121 \n \nBefore a physical copy of the Authorization to Return to Canada Pursuant to Subsection \n52(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act form [IMM 1203B] is issued, the \napplicable cost of $400 must be collected and, if CBSA/IRCC paid for their removal, \nrecovery fees must be collected. \nFNs must repay the following: \n \n$750 for removal to the U.S. or Saint-Pierre and Miquelon [R243(a)]; or \n \n$1,500 for removal to any other destination [R243(b)]. \nRecovery payment must be entered into the Travellers Entry Processing System (TEPS), and \nthe K21 form must be completed using the code 48455, Repayment of Removal Costs, as \nthe cost recovery type. \nFor more information on the repayment of removal costs, please refer to ENF 10, Removals. \nThere are currently no exemptions to the cost recovery fee for an ARC. When authorization \nto return to Canada has been denied, the officer must indicate the denial in the Authority to \nReturn to Canada application in GCMS and issue a Denial of Authorization to Return to \nCanada Pursuant to Subsection 52(1) of IRPA form [IMM 1202B]. \n25.2 Completing an ARC application in GCMS \nThe Authorization to Return to Canada application functionality is accessible in GCMS. The \nperson must be an existing client in FOSS/GCMS and a removal order or PDP document \nmust exist. For more information on completing an Authorization to Return to Canada \napplication in GCMS, refer to GCMS Help or the user guide on the CBSA GCMS Wiki.  \nAn ARC can be completed by a BSO designated by the responsible manager to have GCMS \naccess to create ARC documents. \nNote: The rationale for the decision to Approve or Refuse must be fully explained in the \nNotes tab without delay. \nThe completed ARC application will be recorded in GCMS. \n25.3 Amending an ARC decision in GCMS \nIn exceptional circumstances, there may be occasions where a BSO has issued an ARC and \ninformation is later revealed that the document was issued in error. BSOs should take note \nthat once the Decision field has been completed and the document finalized, the ARC cannot \nbe re-opened and amended. This is because a positive decision will have electronically \nremoved the person’s record from CPIC-PDP. It is therefore imperative for BSOs to be sure \nof their decision before completing the ARC in GCMS. The document can be edited until the \nDecision field has been filled. Should unanticipated circumstances occur requiring that the \ndecision be changed after the ARC has been finalized, the following protocol must be \nfollowed:\n122 \n \nTo reverse a positive decision \nAn email must be sent to Warrant Response Centre (WRC) with a short explanation \nrequesting to re-enable the PREV.DEP flag. Copy and paste the email sent to WRC into the \nNotes tab of the ARC.  \nTo reverse a negative decision \nA new ARC must be created, choose Approved in the Final Assessment menu, explain the \nreason for the reversal in the Notes tab. There is no need to advise the WRC. \n25.4 Effect of ARC decisions on the PDP database \nWhere there is a PREV.DEP flag enabled in FOSS/GCMS, the effect of the ARC will be as \nfollows: \n \na decision to GRANT an ARC will disable the PREV.DEP flag in FOSS/GCMS, remove \nthe person from the PIL “Hit List” and automatically remove the record from CPIC; or \n \na decision to DENY an ARC will maintain the PREV.DEP flag in FOSS/GCMS, cause the \nclient to remain on the PIL “Hit List” and maintain the record in CPIC. \n25.5 Remedial action at POEs \nPerson is in possession of an ARC but PREV.DEP flag still enabled \nBSOs at Immigration Secondary must be prepared to deal with a person who is referred \nfrom the PIL because a PREV.DEP flag appears against the person’s name when queried. \nWhen a referred individual is in possession of an ARC and is still flagged as PREV.DEP in \nFOSS, the following remedial action must be taken: \n \nIf an examination of FOSS historical notes and GCMS notes satisfies the BSO at \nImmigration Secondary that a positive ARC decision was made and the fees \ncollected, but the visa officer neglected to create an ARC application in GCMS on \nwhich to record the decision, the officer, upon authorizing entry into Canada, must \ncreate an ARC application in GCMS in order to disable the PREV.DEP flag and remove \nthe record from CPIC-PDP. \n \nIf an examination of FOSS/GCMS notes indicates that the visa officer issued an ARC \nin error, without considering the need for written authorization to return to Canada, \nthe decision to grant or deny such authorization rests with the BSO at Immigration \nSecondary. \nEntry denied on other inadmissibility grounds  \nThere may be circumstances where a BSO at Immigration Secondary will deny entry to \nCanada on new inadmissibility grounds to a previous deportee who has been authorized to \nreturn to Canada by a visa officer (and therefore the PREV.DEP flag will have already been \ndisabled by the ARC). In such circumstances, BSOs should understand that the requirement\n123 \n \nto obtain authorization to return to Canada has been overcome by the granting of the ARC \nand they should not be exploring ways in which they can re-enable the PREV.DEP flag. \n26 Foreign Missions and International Organizations \nAct (FMIOA) \nThe Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act (FMIOA) extends privileges and \nimmunities to foreign missions and certain international organizations that operate and/or \nhold meetings or conferences in Canada. Section 5 of the FMIOA provides that an order in \ncouncil (OIC) can be signed by the Governor in Council with respect to certain international \norganizations. The OIC accords international organizations and their representatives \nprivileges and immunities outlined in certain sections of the Convention on the Privileges \nand Immunities of the United Nations and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. \nThe OIC can remain permanently in force [such as the OIC that grants privileges and \nimmunities to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) headquarters in Montreal] \nor can be signed to cover a specific meeting or conference of an international organization \nheld in Canada (such as G8 meetings). Finally, the OIC can be signed to encompass all of \nthe provisions in section 5 of the FMIOA, or can limit which privileges and immunities will be \naccorded. \nOn April 30, 2002, a new subsection of section 5 of the FMIOA came into force. \nSubsection 5(4) states that “In the event of an inconsistency or conflict between an \norder [OIC] made under subsection (1) and any of sections 33 to 43 of the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Act, the order [OIC] prevails to the extent of the inconsistency or \nconflict.“ This means that representatives of international organizations covered by an OIC \nof the Governor in Council are not subject to the inadmissibility provisions of IRPA. These \nrepresentatives are not to receive any additional documentation, such as TRPs. They shall \nbe granted temporary resident status in the normal manner. If officers feel there is a need \nto further document the arrival of one of these representatives, a Client Note can be \nentered in GCMS. \nNHQ will receive advance notification of all OICs of the Governor in Council, the regions and \nports may be given alternate directions when applicable. \n27 FOSS/GCMS enforcement flag amendments \n27.1 Background \nThorough POE examinations are necessary to ensure the safety of all Canadian citizens, PRs \nand visitors to Canada. Secondary examinations are, for the most part, considered routine \nand should not be viewed as an accusation of wrongdoing on the part of the traveller. \nEnforcement flags are generated when an immigration enforcement action was previously \nrecorded in FOSS or in GCMS and is linked to the IPIL database. Upon seeking entry to \nCanada at the PIL, persons who have been the subject of previous enforcement actions may \nbe automatically referred to Immigration Secondary due to an active enforcement flag \ncontained in their FOSS/GCMS record. A person may discuss the issue with the POE officer \nthe next time they seek entry into Canada.\n124 \n \nAlthough FOSS/GCMS will always retain a traveller’s immigration enforcement history, it is \npossible to amend these enforcement flags. The determination to request a flag amendment \nis made at the discretion of the BSO and cannot be guaranteed. All enforcement history \nremains intact in FOSS/GCMS, but the flag may be modified from the IPIL database so that \nit no longer generates a mandatory referral at the PIL. Furthermore, only past enforcement \nflags will be considered, ensuring that if any enforcement action were to take place in the \nfuture, the enforcement flag would automatically be reactivated. \n27.2 Considerations \nWhen determining an enforcement flag amendment, the following questions should be \nconsidered:  \n \nHow often does the traveller visit Canada? \n \nWhat was the infraction? \n \nIs there a history of enforcement actions? \n \nWas the traveller a minor at the time of the enforcement action? \n27.3 Procedures for amending an enforcement flag \nIndividual officers should not contact the Operations Support Centre directly for an \nenforcement flag amendment. Officers must follow the procedures below: \n1. Check FOSS history (all records) and GCMS records via GCMS Integrated Search to \nensure that the client has only one unique client identifier (UCI). In cases where \nmore than one UCI exists, household the UCIs by following the instructions in WIKI \nbefore amending an enforcement flag. \n2. Conduct a CPIC/U.S National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check on each client \nthat was previously reported for criminal inadmissibility to ensure that the client is \nno longer criminally inadmissible to Canada. \n3. Where an Info Alert is the reason for the flag at IPIL, BSO who are MDs and \nsuperintendents have the authority to expire them by following Step 11 of the \nProcessing guide of an Info Alert. \n4. Where it is due to a Failed (negative) Admissibility Assessment in GCMS, BSOs must \ncreate a new Examination and Pass (positive) the Admissibility Assessment. Refer to \nthe step-by-step on the Wiki page for procedures.  \nFor more information on this, consult OBO-2020-011 and PRG-2017-38. \n27.4 Enforcement flags on Canadian citizens and persons registered \nunder the Indian Act \nNormally, once a PR of Canada receives citizenship, IRCC grants the citizenship and this \ninformation is reflected in GCMS (or previously in FOSS as an NCB Type 11). Occasionally, \nBSOs will encounter travellers with immigration enforcement flags who have become \ncitizens, but who are still being flagged due to a previous immigration enforcement flag. \nThis is another instance where a BSOMD or superintendent can expire a FOSS Legacy Info \nAlert via GCMS.\n125 \n \nWith the coming into effect of Bill S-3 in 2019, some persons that were considered FN are \nnow persons registered under the Indian Act and therefore enter Canada by right. All \nenforcement flags against these people should be amended as per the steps above. \n \nAppendix A Memorandum of Understanding between IRCC and \nthe CBSA \nhttp://atlas/cab-dgsi/res/toolkit-outils/partnership-partenariat/wca-ece/federal/cic/index_eng.asp \nAppendix B Quarantine Operations Centres \nPublic Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) \nQuarantine Operations Centres \nEffective May 1, 2019, PHAC centralized the management of border and travel health \nnotifications and the assessment of ill travellers through the new PHAC Notification Line: \n1-833-615-2384 and email phac.cns-snc.aspc@canada.ca. Service in both official \nlanguages will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n \nFor more information, refer to People Processing Manual, pt 8, ch. 5.2, Quarantine - Liaison \nwith the Public Health Agency of Canada. \n \nAppendix C Record of Direct Backs for Refugee Claimants at the \nLand Border \nRecord of Direct Backs for Refugee Claimants at the Land \nBorder \n  \n1 \n2 \n3 \nName of the refugee claimant \n(last name, given name) \n \n \n \nGCMS UCI \n() \n \n \n \nPOE \n \n \n \nName of the superintendent who approved the \nDirect Back \n \n \n \nReason for directing back under exceptional \ncircumstances* \n \n \n \nDate and time of Direct Back \ndd/mm/yy – 00h00\n126 \n \nScheduled date of return \ndd/mm/yy \n \n \n \nRemarks \n \n \n \n \nHave you considered the following arrangements before \ndirecting the refugee claimant back? \nMaking arrangements to reduce the waiting time for the \nrefugee claimant by: \nInvoking overtime hours for border services officers to \nprocess a claim  \nCalling in border services officers from a nearby POE  \nUsing the telephone translation service  \nDetaining the claimant, if grounds to detain exist, to complete \nthe examination \n \n*Exceptional circumstances are defined as situations where all \nthe procedures outlined above have been considered and an \nexamination still cannot be conducted. The well-being of the \nclaimant should be considered in conjunction with the impact on \nPOE operations. When it has been determined that a case can \nbe substantiated as an exceptional circumstance, the border \nservices officer must obtain approval from the POE \nsuperintendent before directing a refugee claimant back to the \nUnited States.\n127 \n \nAppendix D Temporary resident permit (TRP) annual \ncompliance review and checklist \nAnnual TRP compliance review \nIn January of each year, Regional Programs Officers in each region will select 10 TRPs \nissued over the course of the previous calendar year. The TRPs will be reviewed for inclusion \nof the mandatory elements explained in section 15.5. The results of the review are to be \nsubmitted to HQ by the end of the January that the review is taking place. (ie. In January of \n2025, select 10 TRPs issued throughout all of 2024. The results are to be submitted by the \nend of January, 2025).  \nIncluded in the review is a check that anyone making decisions under a delegated authority \nor performing the functions of a Minister’s Delegate must have successfully completed the \ntraining prescribed to those positions before exercising their authority as per section and the \nAgency’s National Training Standards. \nThe Apollo folder with the instructions and required material for the review can be found \nhere: Annual TRP Compliance Review \nTRP file checklist \n A short form checklist to assist with ensuring file completion can be found here: \nTRP Checklist \n*This is not used for the compliance review process noted above"
