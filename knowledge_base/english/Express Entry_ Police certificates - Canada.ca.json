To avoid delays,\nLailah could ask for a police certificate from Spain and submit it with\nher application.\nWhy we ask for police certificates\nIf you have a criminal record, you may not be allowed to enter or stay in\nCanada. People who pose a risk to Canada’s security are also not allowed to\ncome to Canada.\nGet the police certificates you need\nIt can take a long time to get police certificates. You should consider asking\nfor them as soon as your profile is in the pool.\nFind out how to get a police certificate\nIf you need a request letter\nSome countries will only give you a police certificate if you have a\nrequest letter from us. If this applies to you:\nUpload a document in the police certificate field in the document\nchecklist that says: “I am applying from a country that requires an\nofficial request letter from IRCC to get a police certificate”.\nWe’ll then review your application. If it is otherwise complete, we’ll\nsend you more information on how to get a police certificate.\nSubmit scanned copies of the original certificates\nPolice certificates must be scanned copies of the original certificate(s) in\ncolour. Certified true copies or unauthorized copies won’t be accepted and\nwill result in your application being rejected.\nWhen the certificate must be issued\nFor the country where you currently live\nThe police certificate for the country where you currently live must be\nissued no more than 6 months before the date you submit your\napplication.\nSince processing times vary, we may ask you for updated police\ncertificates.\nFor any other country\nFor any other country, the police certificate must be issued after the\nlast time you stayed there for 6 months in a row or longer.\nSome countries put expiry dates on their police certificates. If you have\na police certificate that expired, include it. We’ll accept it if:\nit was issued after the last time you stayed there for 6 months in a\nrow or longer\nit is not for the country where you currently live\nWe may ask for updated documents at any time during processing.\nIf you can't get a police certificate in time\nIf you’re invited to apply, you have 60 days to submit your application for\npermanent residence.\nIf you do not have all your police certificates by the 60-day deadline, you can\nprovide:\na letter of explanation, and\nproof that shows you made your best effort to get a police certificate on\ntime\nExamples of proof include:\na confirmation receipt\na payment receipt\na delivery notice\na tracking number\nan explanation from the agency that issues the certificate\nshowing why there is a delay or why it can’t be issued\nYou can upload your letter of explanation and proof in the country-specific\npolice certificate field of your document checklist.\nAn officer will review your application.
