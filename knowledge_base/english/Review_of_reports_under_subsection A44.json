The amendment prescribes that inadmissibility reports with respect to \nunaccompanied minors and persons unable to appreciate the nature of proceedings who \nare unaccompanied must be referred to the Immigration Division if the Minister's \ndelegate determines that a removal order should be sought. \n \n2004-01-26 \n \nThe title for section 23 of chapter ENF 6 in French has been amended and now reads as \nfollows: \nStatut de citoyenneté/Citoyens canadiens qui présentent une demande d'asile \n2003-09-02  \nA minor change was made to section 3.8 and section 24 of ENF 6.  \n \n2003-06-19  \nChanges to section 3.3 and the addition of section 24 relate to the procedures to follow \nwhen issuing administrative removal orders on grounds of misrepresentation pursuant to \nR228(1)(b).\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n6 \n2025-02-20 \n1 What this chapter is about  \nThis chapter provides guidance to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and Immigration, \nRefugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) officials performing the function of the Minister’s \nDelegate (MD) and exercising their authority to review reports prepared under A44(1) of the \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).  \n2 Program objectives  \nThe objectives of Canadian immigration legislation with regard to the inadmissibility provisions \nare: \n \nto protect the health and safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of \nCanadian society; \n \nto promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights \nand denying access to Canadian territory to persons, including refugee claimants, \nwho are criminals or security risks. \n3 The Act and Regulations  \nUnder A44(1), an officer may prepare and transmit a report if that officer is of the opinion that a \npermanent resident or foreign national in Canada is inadmissible. Under A44(2), all A44(1) \nreports must be referred to the MD to determine the accuracy and validity of the report and to \ndecide whether to:   \n \nissue a removal order, where the MD has jurisdiction to do so; or  \n \nrefer the matter to the Immigration Division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board \n(IRB) for an admissibility hearing. \nThe IRPA provides authority both to members of the ID and to the MD to issue removal orders, \ndepending on the type of allegation contained in the A44(1) report, and pursuant to the authority \nprescribed in the IRPA and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) . \nIn order to streamline the enforcement process in cases involving straightforward allegations, \nand to maintain the principle that the MD may make determinations in cases where there is little \nneed to weigh evidence, the scheme of the Act and Regulations empowers the MD to issue \nremoval orders under the circumstances prescribed in R228. Generally speaking, the more \ndiscretion and analysis required in assessing the allegation, the more likely the jurisdiction rests \nwith a member of the ID.   \nIt is important to note that where the MD is authorized to make removal orders under R228, this \nauthority applies at both ports of entry and at inland offices.  \nThe following table includes some of the most relevant provisions that may apply during the \nA44(2) process. Some of the authorities listed below pertain specifically to CBSA Border \nServices Officers (BSOs) at the port of entry or IRCC officers assessing applications; others are \nmore relevant to CBSA Inland Enforcement Officers (IOEs).\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n7 \n2025-02-20 \nTable 1:  Sections of the IRPA and the IRPR applying to determinations under A44(2) \nProvision \nAct and \nRegulations \nDelegation of powers \nA6(2) \nPermanent Resident \nA21(1) \nTemporary resident dual intent \nA22 \nEntry to complete examination or hearing \nA23 \nResidency obligation \nA28 \nSecurity \nHuman or international rights violations \nSanctions \nSerious criminality \nCriminality \nTransborder criminality \nOrganized criminality \nHealth grounds \nFinancial reasons \nMisrepresentation \nCessation of refugee protection \nNon-compliance with the IRPA or IRPA — foreign national \nNon-compliance with IRPA or IRPR — permanent resident \nInadmissible family member \nA34 \nA35 \nA35.1 \nA36(1) \nA36(2) \nA36(2.1) \nA37 \nA38 \nA39 \nA40 \nA40.1 \nA41(a) \nA41(b) \nA42 \nPreparation of report \nA44(1) \nReferral or removal order \nA44(2) \nImposition of Conditions \nA44(3) \nMandatory imposition of conditions — inadmissibility on grounds of \nsecurity \nA44(4),(5) \nApplicable removal order — Immigration Division \nA45(d) \nNo return without prescribed authorization \nA52(1) \nRight of appeal to Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) \nA63 \nLoss of appeal rights \nA64 \nApplication for judicial review \nA72(1) \nProtected person \nA95 \nReferral to Refugee Protection Division  \nA100(1) \nSuspension of consideration of eligibility of claim \nA100(2) \nDeemed referral to Refugee Protection Division  \nA100(3) \nIneligibility to refer refugee claim \nA101 \nCessation of refugee protection \nA108\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n8 \n2025-02-20 \nVacation of refugee protection \nA109 \nNon-refoulement —  protected person \nA115(1) \nMinisterial Opinion for protected person \nA115(2) \nRehabilitation \nR18, R18.1 \nDirect back to the United States \nR41(b) \nWithdrawing application/Allow to leave \nR42 \nConditions A23 \nR43(1) \nApplicable removal order — Minister \n \nSerious criminality/Criminality in Canada (foreign nationals) \nMisrepresentation (vacation of refugee/protected person status) \nCessation of refugee protection \nFailure to comply  \nInadmissible family members  \nInadmissible under A35.1(1) (foreign nationals) \nPermanent residents and their residency obligation  \nClaim for refugee protection  \nUnaccompanied minors \nPersons unable to appreciate the nature of proceedings \nR228 \n \nR228(1)(a) \nR228(1)(b) \nR228(1)(b.1) \nR228(1)(c) \nR228(1)(d) or (e) \nR228(f) \nR228(2) \nR228(3) \nR228(4)(a) \nR228(4)(b) \nApplicable removal order— Immigration Division (ID) \nR229 \n \nFor further information regarding the division of jurisdiction to issue removal orders, see \nAppendix A, ‘Table:  Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) Inadmissible \nClasses’ \n3.1 Forms \nThe following table includes some common forms used in the 44(2) process.

The Minister of \nCitizenship and Immigration [also known as Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada \n(IRCC)] and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PS) are jointly \nresponsible for the administration and enforcement of the IRPA, however there are some \ndifferences. The IRCC Minister is responsible for the overall administration of the IRPA, unless \notherwise specified. The Minister of PS has the primary responsibility for the administration of \nthe IRPA as it relates to the following:  \n \n \nport of entry examinations;\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n10 \n2025-02-20 \n \npolicy lead relating to enforcement of the IRPA including arrest, detention and removal; \n \nestablishment of policies respecting the enforcement of the IRPA and inadmissibility \nunder A34/35/37; and \n \ndeclarations referred to under A42.1 (Ministerial Relief provision) \n \nPursuant to A6(1), the responsible Minister has the authority to designate specific persons or \nclasses of persons to carry out any purpose of any provision of the IRPA with respect to their \nindividual mandates as described in A4, and to specify the powers and duties of the officers so \ndesignated. This is referred to as the designation of authority. In addition, A6(2) authorizes \nthat anything that may be done by the Minister under the Act may be done by a person that the \nMinister authorizes in writing. This is referred to as delegation of authority.   \n \nEach Minister who has responsibilities under the IRPA has written an instrument of delegation \nand designation that is periodically updated. The Delegation of Authority and Designations of \nOfficers (D & D) instruments stipulate who has the authority to perform specific immigration-\nrelated functions. CBSA and IRCC personnel are designated by position to perform all \ndelegated or designated authorities, including those associated with A44(1)/A44(2) functions.  It \nis to be noted that the IRPA D & D instruments have a hierarchical link which means only the \nlowest level of authority is included in the D & D instruments as every position above this one \n(with a direct hierarchical link) has the same authority to perform specific immigration-related \nfunctions. \n \nCBSA and IRCC officials acting in the capacity of the MD in A44(2) proceedings should always \nreview both the CBSA and the IRCC D & D instruments as they have authorities delegated and \ndesignated under both instruments, which can be found on the IL 3-  Designation of Officers and \nDelegation of Authority.  \n \nThe authority to review A44(1) reports has been delegated to certain CBSA and IRCC officials. \nIt is important to note that while IRCC officers have been delegated the authority to review \nreports for most inadmissibility sections, A44(1) reports for inadmissibility under A34 (security \ngrounds), A35 (grounds of violating human or international rights), A35.1 (sanctions) and A37 \n(grounds of organized criminality) may only be prepared and reviewed by CBSA.  \n \nAll reports written by CBSA or IRCC officers will be reviewed by the MD who has been \ndelegated the authority under the D & D instruments. If the MD is of the opinion that the report is \nwell-founded, the MD will make the appropriate decision based on the evidence and determine \nwhether to:  \n \n \nissue a removal order, if the allegation is within the MD’s authority pursuant to R228; or  \n \nrefer the report to the ID pursuant to the R229. \nFor additional information, see Appendix A — ‘Table: Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \n(IRPA) Inadmissible Classes’  \n \nNote:  Policy requires that even where officers and officials acting in the capacity of the \nMinister’s Delegate (including chiefs and directors) have the delegated authority under \nthe D & D instruments, they should not perform Minister's Delegate functions and \nreviews until they have successfully completed the necessary training to perform the \nA44(2) function.  This policy is consistent with the Federal Court’s decision in Zhang v. Canada\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n11 \n2025-02-20 \n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 362 where judicial review was granted based on a \nfinding that there was an inadequate record before the court to conclude that the MD had \nreceived the required Minister’s Delegate Review training and was therefore authorized to issue \na removal order.  \n  \n5 Definitions \nAdult legally responsible \nAn adult legally responsible for a minor or suspected incompetent person may be their parent or \nlegal guardian. If the accompanying adult is not a parent or guardian, reasonable efforts must \nbe made to contact a parent or guardian. For more information on accompanying adults, please \nrefer to ENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children. \n \nForeign national \nA person who is not a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident; includes a stateless person \n[A2(1)]. \n \nIndian \nA person who is registered as an Indian under the Indian Act [R2]. \n \nMinor  \nA minor is a person under 18 years of age. Persons claiming to be less than 18 years of age are \nto be treated as minors unless there is conclusive evidence that they are 18 years old or older.  \n \nPermanent resident \nA person who has acquired permanent residence status and has not subsequently lost that \nstatus under A46 [A2(1)]. \n \nPersons unable to appreciate the nature of proceedings  \nThis phrase refers to persons who are unable to understand the reason for the proceedings or \nwhy they are important, or cannot give meaningful instructions to counsel about their case. An \nopinion regarding competency may be based on the person's own admission, the person's \nobservable behaviour at the proceeding, or an expert opinion on the person's mental health or \nintellectual or physical faculties. Pursuant to R228(4)(b) and R229(4)(b), the authority to issue \nany removal order for persons unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings shall be the \nImmigration Division.  \n \nProtected person \nA person on whom refugee protection is conferred in Canada and whose claim or application \nhas not subsequently been deemed to be rejected because of cessation or vacation \nproceedings [A95(2)].\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n12 \n2025-02-20 \n6 Departmental policy \n6.1 Procedural fairness  \nActions and decisions made under the IRPA must be made in accordance with the principles of \nprocedural fairness and natural justice. These principles apply to the exercise of the powers of \nthe Minister’s delegate. In general terms, this means the MD must: \n \nAllow the person concerned the opportunity to know the case to be met and present \nall relevant facts of the case; \n \nInform the person concerned about the purpose and possible outcomes of the MD \nproceedings; \n \nProvide the person concerned with a reasonable opportunity to respond; \n \nAllow the person to respond to facts or new information that will be considered by the \ndecision-maker; \n \nFully and fairly consider the evidence; \n \nRender decisions that are impartial and free from bias; \n \nProvide the notice of decision and reasons for the decision to the person concerned; \n \nInform the person concerned of a right to counsel if an A44(2) MD proceeding is \ncaused where the person is detained and the Minister has the authority to issue a \nremoval order;  \n \nEnsure that an interpreter is provided where necessary  \nIt is important to differentiate those cases where the MD may issue a removal order and those \ncases where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order lies with the ID, as different procedural \nrequirements and considerations will apply in order to ensure that procedural fairness and \nnatural justice are met.  \nThe content of procedural fairness will also depend on the status of the person concerned and \nadditional considerations will apply for permanent residents and protected persons.  \nFor additional information, see ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports:  section 6.1,  ‘Procedural fairness’; \nsection 8, ‘Considerations before reviewing an A44(1) report- Scope of officer discretion’;  \nsection 9.2, ‘Special considerations for protected persons’; section 10, ‘A44(1) reports \nconcerning permanent residents of Canada’. \nIn reaching a decision, the MD must take into account representations made by persons or by \ntheir counsel, and make particular note of the nature and content of these representations. All \ndecisions of the MD are subject to judicial review, with leave, by the Federal Court of Canada. \nCertain decisions that the MD makes may be subject to appeal before the Immigration Appeal \nDivision (IAD), where a statutory right of appeal exists under the IRPA. \nIndividuals subject to A44 proceedings have the right to know the case against them, which \ngenerally includes understanding what information the MD would rely on in making a decision. \nEach case, however, must turn on its facts and the level of disclosure required at the A44 stage \nmay vary depending on the circumstances of the case.  \nIf an MD relies on new information [i.e., information that was not already provided at the A44(1) \nstage] that is material and that the person concerned would not otherwise be aware of or have\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n13 \n2025-02-20 \naccess to, the MD should ensure that it is provided to the person concerned [for further details, \nsee Durkin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 174]. This is \nparticularly important where the MD has jurisdiction to issue the removal order, as a higher level \nof procedural fairness will apply. Conversely, in cases where the ID has the jurisdiction to issue \nthe removal order, there is no duty to disclose other than information which is “material and \notherwise unknown or unavailable” at A44(1) or A44(2) since the person will be entitled to \nreceive disclosure in the context of an admissibility hearing [Jeffrey v. Canada (Public Safety \nand Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1180]. With respect to all requests for disclosure, MDs \nshould always be cognizant of the legal rules and restrictions on the general disclosure of \ndocuments (e.g., Privacy Act, information sharing agreements, etc.). For further details, MDs \nshould refer to ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports, section 12.5, ‘Disclosure of documents’. \n6.2 Procedures for persons less than 18 years old or persons unable to \nappreciate the nature of the proceedings \nR228(4) provides for specific safeguards for certain vulnerable persons by requiring that where \nthe person: \n \nis under 18 years of age and not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally \nresponsible for them;  or  \n \nis unable, in the opinion of the Minister, to appreciate the nature of the proceedings and \nis not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally responsible for them; \nthe matter must be referred to the ID for an admissibility hearing. In these cases, the MD does \nnot have jurisdiction to issue a removal order.   \nSuch cases will call for a higher degree of procedural fairness at the A44 stage and officers and \nMDs must take extra care to ensure that the person’s interests are represented and that the \nevidence has been fully and fairly considered. \nDuring the ID proceedings, a designated representative will be appointed pursuant to A167(2) to \nrepresent the person’s interests and ensure that procedural fairness requirements are met with \nrespect to presenting evidence relevant to the case and providing a response to facts or new \ninformation that will be considered by the decision-maker. In these hearings, parties will also be \ngoverned by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Chairperson Guideline 8: \n‘Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB’ \nWhere a person appears to be unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, it is \nimportant for the MD to identify this as soon as possible during the A44(2) proceedings. Where \nthe MD, in the course of their interactions with a person, has identified that a person has a \nsuspected or known mental illness and does not appreciate the nature of the proceedings, this \nshould be clearly documented in the MD’s decision so that in cases where the case is being \nreferred for an admissibility hearing, the need for a designated representative is flagged for the \nID. \nIn such cases, the MD should also ensure that other departmental and agency guidelines with \nrespect to dealing with vulnerable persons are followed. See section 6.6, ‘Dealing with \nvulnerable persons’; ENF 20 Detention; and ENF 34 Alternatives to Detention. \nFor additional guidance on how to identify a vulnerable person, see IRCC Program delivery \ninstructions on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable \npersons.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n14 \n2025-02-20 \n6.3 Official languages \nBoth the Official Languages Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establish \nthe right of individuals who are subject to administrative proceedings in Canada to communicate \nwith employees of IRCC and CBSA in the official language of their choice, either French or \nEnglish. Officials carrying out the administration of the IRPA must respect the right of the \nindividual to proceed in French or English. In order to ensure that procedural fairness is \nmaintained, MDs should ensure that all the Minister’s documents are provided in the language \nof the proceedings and, where necessary, obtain translations (e.g., a certificate of conviction \nfrom another country that is not in French or English that the Minister is relying on as evidence). \n6.4 Interpreters \nThe MD must be satisfied that the person concerned is able to understand and communicate in \neither of the official languages in which the proceeding is being held. If necessary, an interpreter \nis to be provided to enable the persons to understand and communicate fully.  \nNote:  Travellers arriving at a port of entry into Canada do not have an automatic right to an \ninterpreter upon request during routine port of entry examinations, however there are situations \nwhere officers at the port of entry are required to suspend the proceedings until a qualified \ninterpreter is available. This may include circumstances where the officer is considering denying \nentry to the traveller. For further information, see Nere v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n2018 FC 672. \nCBSA officers should consult guidelines on the use of interpreters contained in ENF 4 Port of \nentry examinations (section 8.5 ‘Use of interpreters’).  \nFor further information see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on interpreters. \n6.5 Counsel  \nPersons do not have a right to counsel at MD review proceedings, unless they are detained. In \nall detained cases, persons must be given the opportunity to obtain and instruct counsel at their \nown expense. Counsel includes a barrister, solicitor, family member, consultant or friend. \nIn detained cases: The MD must inform persons of their right to counsel prior to commencing \nthe MD review. This right applies in all cases (port of entry and inland) where a person is \ndetained under an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the \ncriminal courts while facing charges or serving a sentence and subject to IRPA proceedings. \nPort of entry:  Generally, CBSA’s policy is not to permit counsel at MD review proceedings \nunless arrest/detention has occurred. However if the MD is dealing with an individual who does \nhave counsel present, the officer should allow the counsel to remain present as long as counsel \ndoes not interfere with the examination process. \nNote:  In Dehghani v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] 1 S.C.R. \n1053], the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) determined that the principles of fundamental \njustice do not include the right to counsel for routine information-gathering, such as that \ngathered at port of entry examination interviews. The SCC further held that an Immigration \nSecondary examination at a port of entry does not constitute a detention within the meaning of \nparagraph 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.1  \n                                                           \n1 Although the SCC held that secondary examination does not constitute detention, this decision also \nhighlighted that detention within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter would result where restraints \non the person’s liberty by state authorities have gone beyond those required for the routine processing or\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n15 \n2025-02-20 \nFor further information regarding right to counsel at POE examinations, officers should refer to  \nENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \nIn non-detained inland cases (CBSA/IRCC): A non-detained person does not have the right to \nhave counsel present during the MD review, however in the spirit of procedural fairness, the MD \nshall inform the person of the possibility of obtaining counsel for the MD review prior to \ncommencing the proceeding. Call-in notices for MD reviews should advise the person that they \nmay have counsel present for the MD review. MDs are not obligated to postpone MD review \nproceedings in non-detained cases due to counsel unavailability, however, may consider such \nrequests on case-by-case basis. \nWhere counsel is representing the person concerned at the proceeding, the MD should ensure \nthat counsel’s identity, the fact of counsel’s presence at the proceeding and statements made \nby counsel on behalf of the person concerned are documented in the their notes, and that \ncounsel’s representations have been considered in their decision. The MD may also need the \nperson’s representative to complete a Use of a Representative form (IMM 5476). For further \ninformation, see IRCC Program delivery instructions on Use of Representatives. \nParticipation by counsel involves speaking on the client's behalf, presenting evidence and \nmaking submissions on the issues. Allowing counsel to participate does not mean that the MD is \nrequired to tolerate disruptive or discourteous behaviour by counsel. Where such conduct is \nencountered, the MD may require counsel to leave and/or the proceeding may be adjourned to \nanother time. In such cases, the MD should ensure to document their reasons for taking such \naction. \n6.6 Dealing with vulnerable persons in the context of A44 \n6.6.1 Considerations for vulnerable persons in the context of A44 \n \nIt is an overall goal of Canada’s immigration program to treat all persons with dignity and \nrespect. In exercising their IRPA authorities, officials must approach all cases in a \nnonjudgmental manner, remain sensitive to the potential needs and limitations of vulnerable \npersons, and recognize that a person they are dealing with may have experienced some form of \nviolence, abuse or trauma. \n \nIn the context of A44, vulnerable persons may face particular challenges, including an impaired \nability to answer questions/provide information to officials respecting a potential IRPA \ninadmissibility, due to a physical or psychological frailty or for other reasons. Such persons may \ninclude, but would not be limited to: \n \n \nminors (under 18 years of age), including unaccompanied minors; \n \nelderly persons; \n \nindividuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities;  \n \npersons with a suspected or known mental illness; \n \npersons who have suffered traumatic experiences that resulted in some degree of \nvulnerability, including: \n                                                           \nscreening of their application to enter Canada. Further, while the SCC’s decision affirmed that delays in \nroutine examinations due to operational necessity do not mean the person is “detained”, officers should \nbe cognizant that unreasonably lengthy delays in the examination could lead to the conclusion that the \nperson is detained within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n16 \n2025-02-20 \no victims2 of gender-based violence (GBV) (see section 6.6.3); \no victims/suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIPs) or family violence. \n \nIn the context of A44 procedures, officers/MDs should: \n \n \nIdentify vulnerable persons at the earliest opportunity in order to ensure that appropriate  \naccommodations are made and any relevant considerations are factored into decisions \nand actions taken. In some instances, officers/MDs will need to use their observational \nskills, discretion and sound judgement in identifying a person as vulnerable.   \n \n \nRecognize that a vulnerable individual’s ability to respond to questions or provide \ninformation may be severely impaired, and remain sensitive to the impact of a perceived \nvulnerability during the A44 process, including during interviews. \n \n \nTo the extent possible, prevent vulnerable persons from becoming traumatized or re-\ntraumatized during the A44 process. \n \nWhere an individual who is subject to IRPA enforcement action is identified as a victim of \nviolence, trauma or abuse, including victims of GBV, family violence or trafficking in persons, or \nother forms of abuse such as sexual abuse or labour abuse, officers/MDs must take a victim-\ncentered and trauma-informed approach in order to avoid re-victimizing people who report \nviolence or abuse.  \n \nA victim-centred approach focuses on the needs and concerns of victims to ensure a \ncompassionate and sensitive delivery of services in a nonjudgmental manner.  \n \nA trauma-informed approach is one that avoids triggering trauma that may have placed the \nindividual in their current situation. \n \nThe guidelines in sections 6.6.2 to 6.6.5 are aimed at assisting MDs in identifying vulnerable \npersons and applying a victim-centred and trauma-informed approach when dealing with \nvulnerable persons at A44. \n \nIn addition to the guidelines set out in this manual chapter, MDs should always ensure that other \nDepartmental and Agency guidelines with respect to dealing with vulnerable persons and \nminors are followed, including IRCC’s Program delivery instructions on Identifying sensitive \ncases and on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable \npersons, where applicable. \n6.6.2 Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression and sex characteristics3 \n \nSome IRPA enforcement cases may involve individuals with, or who are perceived to have, \n                                                           \n2 It is important to recognize wherever the term “victim” is used, that some persons who have experienced \nviolence, trauma or abuse may prefer to be referred to as “survivors” rather than “victims”. \n \n3 Please note that terminology in this section may have further evolved following the publication date of \nthis manual. Consult most recent GoC publications for most up to date terminology.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n17 \n2025-02-20 \nsexual orientations, gender identities and expressions (SOGIE)4 that may not conform  to \nsocially accepted norms in a particular cultural environment. Such individuals include, but are \nnot limited to: Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and additional \nsexually and gender diverse (2SLGBTQI+) individuals. Depending on factors such as race, \nethnicity, religion, faith or belief system, age, disability, health status, social class and education, \nindividuals with diverse sexual orientations and identities may recognize and express their \nidentity differently.  \n \nIndividuals may conceal their SOGIE out of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-\nstate actors, or due to previous experiences of discrimination, stigmatization, bullying, \nostracism, violence or sexual assault. These circumstances may manifest themselves as an \nindividual being reluctant to discuss, or having difficulty discussing, their SOGIE with an officer \nbased on a fear or general mistrust of authority figures, particularly where intolerance or \npunishment of individuals with diverse SOGIE are sanctioned by state officials in an individual’s \ncountry of origin. \n \nOfficials need to be sensitive to the possibility that SOGIE issues may exist in any case they \nencounter when executing their IRPA authorities. Officials must follow all relevant guidelines \nand procedures pertaining to handling SOGIE cases during the A44 process, remain sensitive \nto gender-related considerations when interacting with the person and be careful to use gender-\nneutral or inclusive terms or terms that reflect the person’s gender identification in \ndocumentation/notes and when completing Departmental and Agency forms. \n \nOfficials should consult the Internationally recognized sexual orientation or gender identity or \nexpression (SOGIE) definitions on IRCC’s Connexion for further information. \n6.6.3 Victims of gender-based violence (GBV) \n \nWhen considering enforcement under A44, officers and MDs need to be sensitive to the fact \nthat a person they encounter may have been subjected to specific violence, trauma or abuse \nbased solely on their gender, perceived gender, gender identity or gender expression, as \nwell as sexual orientation. This is referred to as gender-based violence (GBV), which is a \nhuman rights violation.  \n \nIt is important to note that GBV is not limited to physical violence and can also include \nemotional/psychological abuse, harassment, threats, sexual violence, coercive control, \nhumiliation, financial abuse, discrimination or neglect. It is important to note that these may also \noccur online through “cyberviolence”5.  \n \nOfficers and MDs should be aware that certain individuals face a greater risk of experiencing \nGBV, including:  women, girls, 2SLGBTQI+ people and people living with disabilities. Moreover, \nthe risk of GBV may be increased with the intersection of any two or more of these \n                                                           \n4 Also includes individuals with, or who are perceived to have diverse sex characteristics and may also be \nreferred to as SOGIESC. For example, see the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada’s \nChairperson’s Guidelines on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity \nand Expression, and Sex Characteristics: https://irb.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/policies/Pages/GuideDir09.aspx. \n5 “Use of technologies to facilitate virtual or in-person harm including observing and listening to a person, \ntracking their location, to scare, intimidate or humiliate a person” (Government of Canada, Fact sheet: \nIntimate partner violence (Canada.ca).\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n18 \n2025-02-20 \ncharacteristics. Other groups that may experience high levels of GBV may also include Black \nwomen and newcomer women to Canada6.  \n \nIntimate partner violence (IPV), also referred to as domestic violence or spousal violence, is a \nwidespread form of GBV that encompasses multiple forms of harm perpetrated by a current or \nformer intimate partner or spouse. IPV can occur in many types of relationships, including \nbetween married or common-law spouses as well as within dating relationships, regardless of \ngender and sexual orientation and whether or not the partners co-habit. \n \nFor further information respecting IPV, see the Government of Canada’s Fact sheet on Intimate \npartner violence. \n \nDepending on their cultural background, victims of GBV may be reluctant to disclose their \nexperiences in order to not “shame” their families or communities. Similarly, women who have \nbeen subjected to IPV/domestic violence or abuse may also be reluctant to provide information, \nespecially against the alleged perpetrator. MDs should be alert to such cases and will ensure to \nthe extent possible that specific accommodations are made during interviews as set out  (e.g., \nhave a female officer either conduct or be present during an interview, and arrange, if possible, \nfor a female interpreter). See section 6.6.4 below for additional guidance on conducting \ninterviews. \n \nVictims and survivors of GBV may be encountered both at the port of entry or inland. In such \ncases, officers/MDs should: \n \n \nConsider the factors that led to the individual’s breach of IRPA requirements or conditions, \nincluding the possibility that the person was placed in their situation as part of abuse or \nthrough coercion or threats; \n \nBe aware that perpetrators of GBV are known to use threats of denunciation to immigration \nauthorities as a tool to control and oppress victims through fear of deportation and/or \ndetention. For example, MDs shall consider any such factors that may lead them to believe \nthat a foreign national overstayed their status as a result of being placed in that situation by \nan abuser; \n \nWithin the confines of an MD’s limited discretion at A44(2), be sensitive to personal \ncircumstances as well as the consequences of immigration enforcement;  \n \nWhere appropriate and within an MD’s scope of discretion, consider other options where \nthere are IRPA inadmissibility concerns. At the port of entry, this may include allowing the \nperson to withdraw their application to enter Canada (i.e. Allowed to leave) or issuing a \nTemporary resident permit (TRP) to overcome an inadmissibility that may have resulted \nfrom GBV. In the inland and port of entry context, this may include a referral to IRCC for \nTRP consideration and/or to community-based service organizations experienced in \nproviding services to GBV victims and survivors in accordance with existing policy and \nregional procedures or allowing the person to make arrangements to leave Canada if they \nplan to do so. \n \nFor further resources on GBV, please refer to the Government of Canada’s Gender-Based \nViolence Knowledge Centre (Canada.ca). \n                                                           \n6 Government of Canada, What is gender-based violence? (Canada.ca)\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n19 \n2025-02-20 \n6.6.4 Interviewing vulnerable persons  \n \nOfficers and MDs must be alert to situations where a person’s ability to answer questions and \npresent information during A44 proceedings may be impacted by one or more factors listed in \nsection 6.6.1 above. Officers/MDs may find that vulnerable persons may have issues affecting \ntheir memory, behaviour, or ability to recount relevant events including symptoms that have an \nimpact on the consistency and coherence of their statements.  \n \nOfficers/MDs should be cognizant that individuals react to violence, trauma and abuse in \ndifferent ways and not all victims will exhibit identical or even similar signs and/or symptoms. \nWhile some individuals may show signs of distress, including anxiety, irritability, nervousness, \nagitation, anger and aggressiveness, others may be easily intimidated and have difficulty \ncommunicating. \n \nIn order to conduct A44 interviews in a way that avoids traumatizing vulnerable persons or re-\nvictimizing persons who have experienced violence, trauma or abuse, officers/MDs should: \n \nRecognize that some vulnerable persons may display less obvious symptoms of a \nvulnerability, which may not become apparent until the person is interviewed/examined. \nOfficers/MDs may need to rely on observational skills and sound judgement in identifying \nsigns and symptoms of a vulnerability.   \n \nBe aware that some vulnerable persons may require special accommodations during the \ninterview. Remain sensitive to the fact that victims of severe trauma may have difficulties \ncoping with the interview process because they are confined to a closed room with the \ninterviewer. \n \nCreate optimum conditions to minimize stress. Allow for frequent breaks, if necessary \nand to the extent possible.  \n \nBe conscious of cultural and gender considerations which may affect communication \nsuch as the person and officer being the same gender, where possible. \n \nRecognize that victims of violence or abuse may fear people in authority and may be \nintimidated by the many questions that are being asked by officials. \n \nRecognize that victims of GBV or other forms of violence or abuse may become \ndistressed at the prospect of being interviewed by an official of the opposite sex. \n \nWhere appropriate, speak to the person alone first in a confidential setting and ask if \nthey are comfortable speaking in front of family members (particularly parents, children \nor relatives of a particular gender). \n \nProvide the person with a fair opportunity to tell the story. \n \nBe cognizant that there may only be one opportunity for an individual to reach out to \nauthorities, and for authorities to refer a victim of violence or abuse to victim support \nservices.  \n \nBe courteous, respectful, sensitive and aware of own biases. \n \nBe aware that some questions may cause a victim to recall painful events. \n \nTreat the person with sensitivity and with empathy and with full respect of their human \nrights. \n \nAvoid an authoritarian approach. \n \nAvoid over-familiarity through eye contact or body language. \n \nAsk simple questions and use encouragement. \n \nUse active listening. \n \nAllow free speech and avoid interruption. \n \nRemember that if the vulnerable person is under 18 years of age or unable to appreciate \nthe nature of the proceedings, procedural safeguards set out in section 6.2 will apply.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n20 \n2025-02-20 \n6.6.5 TRPs for victims or suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIP) or family \nviolence  \n \nOfficials should keep in mind that there are specific policy guidelines in place respecting \nsuspected or known victims of trafficking in persons (VTIP) and victims of family violence. While \nonly IRCC officials may issue TRPs to VTIPs or victims of family violence, CBSA officials should \nfollow the guidelines set out in the IRCC Program delivery instructions for handling these cases. \nFor example, cases in which a foreign national is identified by the CBSA as a VTIP or victim of \nfamily violence should be referred to the responsible IRCC local office on an urgent basis. There \nare also instructions pertaining to IRCC procedures for contacting CBSA with respect to \nindividuals who are subject to a removal order that are applying for a VTIP or victim of family \nviolence TRP.  \n \nWhen dealing with victims or suspected victims, officials must continue to apply existing policy \nguidance respecting VTIPs and victims of family violence. For example, MDs will take a victim-\ncentred and trauma-informed approach when a permanent resident or foreign national is \nidentified as a possible VTIP and follow existing guidelines and procedures specific to \nidentifying and interviewing suspected VTIPs, as well as identifying and conducting interviews \nfor suspected human traffickers who are encountered at the port of entry or inland.  \n \nOfficers and MDs should always be alert to any information that raises concerns that a minor \nchild has been trafficked, smuggled or abducted. In such situations, officers/MDs should refer to \nthe procedures set out in the following guidance: \n \nENF 21 Recovering missing, abducted and exploited children  \n \nTemporary resident permits (TRPs): Considerations specific to victims of trafficking in \npersons \n \n \n \n7 Procedure: Review of the A44(1) report by the Minister’s Delegate \n7.1 Transmission of an A44(1) report to the Minister’s Delegate \nUnder A44(1), an officer may prepare a report if that officer is of the opinion that a permanent \nresident or foreign national in Canada is inadmissible.   \nAll A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents and foreign nationals must be referred to the \nMD making the final decision about whether or not to issue a removal order or refer the matter \nto the Immigration Division. \nWhere the officer transmitting the report to the MD has also prepared an A44(1) case highlights \nform (IMM 5084B for inland cases or BSF516 for port of entry cases), a detailed memorandum \nor an A44(1) narrative report, this must also accompany the A44(1) report.   \nThe officer transmitting the report must also forward to the MD, all documentation and evidence \nrelied on by the officer in forming their opinion, including but not limited to: \n \nfor permanent residents, proof of a search of citizenship records; \n \ncopies of all relevant immigration documents and other certificates and affidavits that \ncan be obtained from IRCC, if applicable;\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n21 \n2025-02-20 \n \noriginals or copies of other documents relevant to the case, such as a birth certificate, \nmarriage certificate, a certificate of conviction or other evidence of a previous conviction \nthat is acceptable in a court of law; \n \npolice occurrence reports; \n \nprobation, parole and psychiatric assessments; \n \npolice records and information on other convictions not reportable under A44(1); \n \nother documentary evidence that supports the allegation(s), including statutory \ndeclarations;  \n \nevidence filed by the person concerned. \n \nSee also, ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating inadmissibility; and ENF 23 Loss of \npermanent resident status. \nThe importance of forwarding the officer’s recommendation to the MD at the same time as the \nA44(1) report is transmitted was highlighted in Wong v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) \n2011 FC 971.  In that case, the Federal Court dealt with the legality of two removal orders \nissued by the MD prior to the A44(1) case highlights form being signed and dated. In finding that \nthis sequence of events rendered the orders improperly issued and therefore null and void, the \nCourt affirmed that the officer’s recommendation needed to be reviewed by the MD as part of \nthe A44 process before a removal order was issued.   \n7.2 Reviewing the A44(1) report \nOnce the A44(1) report is transmitted by the officer to the MD, the MD will then review the report \nto determine its accuracy and validity. \nAccuracy refers to the determination of the correctness of details contained in the report. \nPrior to any substantive review by the MD, it is important for the MD to conduct an initial review \nof the A44(1) report to ensure that: \n \nthe biographical data is correctly cited [name(s), date of birth]; \n \nthe status of person concerned is correctly identified in the A44(1) report; \n \nthe inadmissibility section has been properly cited; and  \n \nthe A44(1) report has been signed and dated.   \nAny report containing such errors should be sent back to the officer who wrote the A44(1) report \nso that it can be corrected accordingly. \nValidity refers to the determination of whether the report is well-founded, based on the MD’s \nreview of all of the evidence. \nIf the report is found to be valid, then the MD upholds the report and decides on the disposition \nof the case. \nThe disposition of the MD review under A44(2) will depend on the allegations and \ncircumstances of each case and may include: \n \nreferring the case to an admissibility hearing; \n \nissuing a removal order;\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n22 \n2025-02-20 \n \nallowing the person to leave Canada (POE cases only); \n \nissuing a Temporary resident permit (TRP); or \n \nissuing a warning letter (permanent residents/protected persons). \nIf the MD finds that the report is not valid, the MD may authorize the person to enter or remain in \nCanada;  in certain circumstances, the MD may also decide to send the report back to an officer \nto for consideration of preparing a new report with the accurate allegation. \n7.3 Procedure: Evidentiary requirements \nTo form the opinion that an A44(1) report is well-founded, the MD must have knowledge of the \nevidentiary rules and requirements for immigration matters. Knowledge of what may be required \nto substantiate an allegation of inadmissibility is an important consideration in all cases. \nEach allegation has specific requirements for evidence and officers are to be guided by the \ncontent of ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility; and ENF 18 Human or \ninternational rights violations. \nIn order to make a decision on the validity of an A44(1) report, the MD must be satisfied that the \napplicable burden and standard of proof may be met and that sufficient evidence has been or \nmay be gathered to ensure that each element of an inadmissibility allegation may be satisfied. \n7.4 Burden of proof  \nThe burden of proof, in the context of immigration legislation, refers to who is responsible for \nestablishing admissibility under the IRPA. \nUnder A45(d), the burden of establishing admissibility depends on whether or not the person \nhas been authorized to enter Canada.  \nIn cases of foreign nationals who are seeking entry (primarily applicable to port of entry cases) \nor those who entered Canada illegally, the onus is on the individual to establish that they are not \ninadmissible. Where the person has been authorized to enter Canada the burden to establish \ninadmissibility is on the Minister. \nTable 3:  Burden of proof \nPersons authorized/not \nauthorized to enter \nDetails \nBurden of proof \nPermanent residents and \nforeign nationals authorized \nto enter \nA45(d) requires the Immigration Division to \nmake a removal order against a \npermanent resident or a foreign national \nwho has been authorized to enter Canada, \nif it is satisfied that they are inadmissible. \n \nConsequently, in cases involving persons \nwho were granted entry into Canada, \nincluding permanent residents, the onus \nrests on the Minister to establish that the \nperson is inadmissible. \n \n \n \nMinister\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n23 \n2025-02-20 \nForeign nationals not \nauthorized to enter \nA45(d) requires the Immigration Division to \nmake a removal order if it is not satisfied \nthat a foreign national who has not been \nauthorized to enter Canada is not \ninadmissible. A21(1) states that a foreign \nnational becomes a permanent resident \nand A22(1) states that a foreign national \nbecomes a temporary resident if an officer \nis satisfied that, inter alia, the foreign \nnational is not inadmissible. \n \nThis applies to persons seeking entry into \nCanada or those persons who have \nentered illegally. Consequently, the onus is \non these persons to establish that they are \nnot inadmissible. \n \nForeign national \n7.5 Standard of Proof \nThe term “standard of proof” refers to the degree to which the decision-maker must be satisfied. \nImmigration proceedings are civil in nature and therefore the general standard of proof is the \none applicable to civil matters: balance of probabilities. However A33 provides that, unless \notherwise provided, the standard of proof for allegations listed under sections A34 to A37, is a \nlower standard of proof: reasonable grounds to believe that the facts have occurred, are \noccurring or may occur, applies. \n \n“Balance of Probabilities” is a civil standard of proof used in administrative tribunals. It means \nthat the evidence presented must show that the facts as alleged are more probable than not. \nThe party having the burden of proof must demonstrate that the evidence presented outweighs \nany opposing evidence or arguments. It is a higher standard of proof than “reasonable grounds \nto believe”, but is lower than the criminal standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” used in \ncriminal proceedings. \n \n“Reasonable grounds to believe” is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility that fact has \nbeen established based on credible evidence. Reasonable grounds to believe is more than \nsuspicion. Some objective basis for the belief has to exist. Put another way, the fact itself need \nnot be proven; it is enough to show reasonable grounds for believing the allegation true. \nInformation used to establish reasonable grounds should be specific, compelling, credible and \nbe received from a reliable source. \n \nThe following table summarizes the standard of proof for sections A34 to A42:\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n24 \n2025-02-20 \nTable 4:  Standard of proof \nReasonable grounds to believe \nBalance of probabilities \n \nSecurity (A34) \n \nViolation of human or international \nrights (A35) \n \nSanctions (A35.1) \n \nCriminality (A36) – except for \nA36(1)(c) for permanent residents \n \nTransborder criminality [A36(2.1)] \n \nOrganized crime (A37) \n \n \n \nAct or omission committed outside \nCanada – for permanent residents \nonly [A36(1)(c)] \n \nHealth reasons (A38) \n \nFinancial reasons (A39) \n \nMisrepresentation (A40) \n \nCessation (A40.1) \n \nNon-compliance with the Act or the \nRegulations (A41) \n \nInadmissible family member (A42) \n  \n7.6 Duty to provide information  \nA person who seeks to enter Canada at a port of entry or who makes an application at an inland \noffice that they should be authorized to enter or remain in Canada, as the case may be, must \ntruthfully provide such information as an officer may require for the purpose of the examination. \nAs such persons are subject to examination, there is a legal obligation under A16(1) to answer \ntruthfully all questions put to them by an officer for the purpose of the examination, and produce \nall documents or other evidence reasonably required. \n \nR37 specifies the point at which the examination of a person who seeks to enter Canada, or \nmakes an application to transit through Canada, ends. Generally, examinations will end when \nan officer makes a decision on the application before them or, in cases referred to the MD, \nwhen a determination has been made.  For refugee claimants, however, R37(2) provides \ndesignated officers the authority to examine a refugee claimant until the refugee claim has been \ndetermined by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the IRB. The same obligation to \nanswer truthfully applies to persons claiming to be refugees who are referred for a determination \nof eligibility pursuant to A100(1.1).  \n \nWhile there is no way of compelling persons to comply with the legal obligation to provide \ntruthful information, under the IRPA it is an offence to knowingly provide false or misleading \ninformation under A127 (Misrepresentation). \n \nIt should be noted by officers at the port of entry that while permanent residents are subject to \nexamination when seeking entry, the IRPA gives permanent residents of Canada the right to \nenter Canada at a port of entry pursuant to A19(2) once the officer is satisfied that the person \nholds permanent resident status. The obligation to answer truthfully under A16(1) for permanent\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n25 \n2025-02-20 \nresidents is linked to A18(1) and must be related to examination for the purpose of establishing \nthat the person holds permanent resident status in Canada.   \n \nWhile an officer who is satisfied at examination that a person holds permanent resident status \nmust admit that person, the officer may also form an opinion during examination that the \npermanent resident is inadmissible for other reasons under the IRPA. In such cases, the officer \nshould advise the person that while it has been established that they have a right to enter \nCanada, there are reasons to believe that they could become the subject of a report under the \nIRPA which could lead to the issuance of a removal order. If the person wishes to continue \nanswering questions or providing information/submissions pertaining to the allegation, they \nshould be given an opportunity but are not required to do so. Even if a permanent resident \nbecomes the subject of an A44(1) report, they continue to have a right to enter until a final \ndetermination has been made regarding their loss of status. \n \nFor further details on examination, see ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports and ENF 4 Port of entry \nexaminations. \n \n \n \n8 Scope of Discretion of the Minister’s Delegate \n8.1 Minister’s Delegate Options— Limited discretion of the MD at A44(2) \n \nWhere the MD reviews the A44(1) report and finds that it is well-founded, there are \ncircumstances in which the objectives of the IRPA may be achieved without the issuance of a \nremoval order. The MD has the discretion to take other action within the exercise of their \ndelegated authority as set out in the IRPA and the IRPR. However, as will be seen in this \nsection, the scope of discretion of the MD is limited. \n \nThe use of the word “may” in the IRPA suggests that Parliament intended to provide the officer \nand the MD with some discretion on decisions made under A44(1) and A44(2). While the body \nof case law respecting this scope of discretion varies, Canadian jurisprudence does affirm that \nan MD’s discretion under A44 is limited. \n \nThe discretion under A44(1) and A44(2) does not mean that officers and MDs can disregard the \nfact that someone is, or may be, inadmissible. The discretion under A44 is meant to give officers \nand MDs some flexibility in managing cases where circumstances warrant that no removal order \nwill be sought and where the objectives of the IRPA may or will be achieved without the need to \nwrite an inadmissibility report under A44(1) or issue a removal order/refer the case to the ID \nunder A44(2).  \n \nThe courts have also found that this scope of discretion varies depending on the inadmissibility \ngrounds alleged, whether the person concerned is a permanent resident or a foreign national, \nand whether the MD or the ID has the authority to issue a removal order. In other words, the \nscope of discretion has been viewed as “variable and flexible”.7 \n \nFor example, in the case of Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. \nCha, 2006 FCA 126, a case involving a foreign national inadmissible under paragraph 36(2)(a) \n                                                           \n7 Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FCA 319\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n26 \n2025-02-20 \nof the IRPA, the FCA held that in spite of the use of the word “may” in the wording of subsection \nA44(2), there are limits to the discretion afforded to officers and MDs. The FCA held that with \nrespect to foreign nationals inadmissible for criminality or serious criminality, officers and MDs \nhave limited discretion under A44(1) and A44(2). The Court further outlined that the particular \ncircumstances of the foreign national, the nature of the offence, the conviction, and the \nsentence are beyond the scope of the discretionary power of the officer when considering \nwhether or not to write an A44(1) report for criminality or serious criminality against a foreign \nnational. The FCA also concluded that permanent residents have more rights and therefore \nbenefit from more discretion by decision-makers than foreign nationals do.   \n \nMore recent jurisprudence8 confirms that officers and MDs making decisions under A44 have \nvery limited discretion on whether to refer a case for an admissibility hearing, particularly in \nmatters concerning serious criminality and organized criminality, and that there is no obligation \nfor officers or MDs to consider factors related to H&C or ‘personal circumstances’. These \ndecisions also confirm that at this the 44 stage, officers and MDs are conducting a fact-finding \nmission into “readily and objectively ascertainable facts” and that this administrative screening \nfunction applies to both foreign nationals and permanent residents. \n \nIn general, discretion under A44 means that officers and MDs have some flexibility in managing \ncases where the person is inadmissible, however the objectives of the IRPA may or will be \nachieved without the need to write a report under A44(1) or, at the MD level, issue a removal \norder or A44(2) referral, for example:  \n \n \nwhere an MD allows a withdrawal of an application to enter Canada (Allowed to Leave) \noption at a port of entry after an A44(1) report has been written; \n \nwhere a person is already subject to an enforceable removal order and the MD \ndetermines that the objectives of the IRPA would not be served by the issuance of an \nadditional removal order and determines that a disposition of “no further action” on the \nA44(2) report would be appropriate; \n \nwhere an MD decides to issue a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) to a foreign national \ntaking into account the relevant assessment risk factors set out in agency and \ndepartmental guidance (e.g., foreign national who is seeking entry to work in Canada \nand who was convicted of a non-violent offence many years ago);  \n \nwhere the MD holds the A44(2) review in abeyance pending the decision on an \napplication to IRCC for restoration of status by a foreign national who has remained in \nCanada beyond the period authorized; or \n \nwhere the MD decides that the issuance of a warning letter for a permanent resident or \nprotected person reported under A36(1) is warranted, in consideration of all of the \ncircumstances of the case, including the objectives under paragraphs A3(1)(h) and (i) of \nthe IRPA.  \n                                                           \n8 Obazughanmwen v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FCA 151; \nSidhu v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FC 1681; Matharu v. \nCanada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 902\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n27 \n2025-02-20 \n8.2 Priority Cases: Inadmissibility under A34, A35, A35.1, A36 and A37 of the IRPA \nIt was affirmed by the FCA in Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n2016 FCA 319, that within the context of A44, officers and the MD must always be mindful of \nParliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make security of Canadians a top priority. \nIn Sharma, the FCA also concluded that the FCA’s rationale in Cha in support of a limited \ndiscretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals and permanent \nresidents. \n \nAlthough the factors contained in these guidelines may be considered at the A44(2) stage, \nofficers and MDs must always be mindful of the various objectives of the IRPA, in particular \nA3(1)(h) and (i). As suggested by Federal Court jurisprudence, in cases of inadmissibility under \nA34 to A37, the scope of discretion enjoyed by officers and MDs making a decision under A44 \nwill be very narrow and generally it is reasonably open to officers and MDs to prioritize public \nsafety and security.  \n8.3 Special considerations for protected persons \n \nUnder the IRPA, protected persons are provided with certain protections, including the right of \nnon-refoulement under A115(1) and, subject to A64, the right under A63(3) to appeal to the IAD \nagainst a decision to make a removal order against them. This was recognized by Justice \nDécary in Cha, who noted that the Act and the Regulations treat permanent residents differently \nthan Convention Refugees who are, in turn, treated differently than other foreign nationals.      \n \nIt should be noted that the Federal Court jurisprudence would support that protected persons \nare not entitled to a higher degree of procedural fairness or participatory rights with respect to \nthe operation of A44 than other foreign nationals or permanent residents [see Awed v. Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 469].  Officers and MDs should also keep in mind that \nthe Federal Court has made findings to support the principle that officials carrying out A44(1) \nand (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate about how and when future deportation might \ntake place [Faci v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2011 FC 693]. \n \nIn cases of protected persons, the MD may also consider as an additional factor in their \nassessment, whether the facts of the case would support a referral for a Ministerial opinion \n(‘Danger Opinion’) under A115(2). For further information, see ENF 5, section 14.5, ‘Overview:  \nMinister's opinions/interventions’. \n \n \n9 Charter considerations \n \nThe purpose of this section is to provide guidance to officials performing MD functions under \nA44(2) in handling Charter and/or constitutional arguments made in the course of A44(2) \nproceedings.  \n \nThe jurisprudence respecting the application of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 9 \n(Charter) at the A44(2) stage is in a state of flux.10 Therefore, current guidance to MDs is \nconstrained by the evolving state of the law in this area. \n                                                           \n9 Constitution Act, 1982, Part I Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \n \n10 For example, see Revell v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 262;\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n28 \n2025-02-20 \nExisting case law establishes that all administrative decision-making must be consistent with the \nCharter.11  Under the IRPA, this requirement has been incorporated into the objectives of the Act \nunder A3(3)(d).  \n \nWhere a person specifically alleges that a provision of IRPA or its application (i.e., decision of \nthe MD to issue a removal order or refer the report to the Immigration Division ID for an \nadmissibility hearing) breaches one or more enumerated Charter right, the MD must address \nthese Charter concerns in their written decision. This was affirmed by the Federal Court in its \ndecision in Abdi v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 733. In \nother words, the MD cannot ignore Charter arguments. This does not mean, however, that MDs \nare expected to engage in a complex Charter analysis within the context of A44(2) decisions. \n \nIn most cases, the courts have found that the specific Charter rights being raised do not apply at \nthe A44(2) admissibility stage, that is, it is premature to say at the A44 stage that the MD’s \ndecision will impact these enumerated Charter rights. For example, in Brar v. Canada, 2016 FC \n1214, the Federal Court expressed doubts that section 7 rights could be engaged by the A44(2) \nreferral decision, and, in a related case, reiterated that section 7 rights are not engaged at the \nreferral stage (Brar v. Canada, 2017 FC 820).  \n \n \nMDs should keep in mind that the courts have found that the objectives of the IRPA \nindicate Parliament’s intent to prioritize the security of Canadians. 12  \n \nMDs should note that the Federal Court has found that the MD is not obliged to \nspeculate about how and when a future deportation might take place or engage in a \nsection A25 (H&C considerations) or a section A112 (Pre-Removal Risk Assessment) \nanalysis.13 \n \nWhere a person specifically mentions a breach of their Charter rights in either \nverbal or written submissions, the MD should record this in their notes and address it \nin their reasons, even if only to say that they do not find that specific Charter rights are \nengaged at this stage and provide supporting reasons.  \n \nConstitutional arguments about legislation:  \n \nIn cases where the person concerned is challenging the constitutionality of a provision of the \nIRPA itself:  \n \nCBSA and IRCC officials do not have jurisdiction to grant Charter remedies under \nsection 52 of the Constitution Act or under section 24 of the Charter.14   \n                                                           \nMoretto v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 261; Surgeon v. Canada (Public Safety and \nEmergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1314 \n \n11 Doré v. Barreau du Québec, 2012 SCC 12 \n \n12 Medovarski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] 2 S.C.R. 39 \n13 Faci v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2011 FC 693 \n14 Under subsection 24. (1) of the Charter, a person whose rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Charter, \n“have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as \nthe court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances”.  Pursuant to subsection 52(1) of the \nConstitution Act, a court may also strike down a legislated provision which is found to infringe a person’s \nCharter rights as invalid. Subsection 24(1) of the Charter relates to personal remedies for a government\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n29 \n2025-02-20 \n \nWhere the MD is specifically asked to rule on the constitutionality of A44(2) or another \nprovision under the IRPA, the MD should indicate in their decision that they do not have \nthe authority to do so and such a remedy should be sought in a court of competent \njurisdiction.  \n \nIf the MD is requested to delay A44(2) procedures so that the person concerned may \nmake an application to the Federal Court on the constitutionality of a provision under the \nIRPA, the MD should, in deciding the request, consider that the legal process permits an \napplication to the Federal Court to be made following the decision on eligibility or \nadmissibility. Consequently, there is no reason, based on a constitutional argument, for \nthe MD to permit a delay of procedures for the purpose of pursuing a Federal Court \napplication. \n \n \n10 Cases where the MD has jurisdiction to issue a removal order \n10.1 Procedural fairness considerations \n \nThe purpose of A44(2) proceedings is for the MD to review the A44(1) report to determine \nwhether the report is well-founded. In prescribed circumstances set out in the Regulations, \nwhere the MD determines that the A44(1) report is well-founded, the MD has the authority to \nissue a removal order.    \n \nIn cases where the MD has the authority to issue a removal order, the MD will need to ensure \nthat certain steps are completed to ensure that procedural fairness has been met. \n \nDuring in-person proceedings before the MD, the person concerned must be informed of the \npurpose of the A44(2) interview/proceeding and the possible outcomes of it. Prior to a \nsubstantive review, the MD must also give the person concerned the opportunity to obtain the \nservices of an interpreter where one is necessary and the MD must ensure that the person \nconcerned understands the proceedings. In certain circumstances, such as where the person \nconcerned is detained, the officer must also explain the right to counsel and ensure that an \nopportunity to be represented by counsel has been provided. \n \nPersons must be informed of the nature of the allegations regarding their inadmissibility \ncontained in the A44(1) report(s) at the earliest opportunity, and must be given a reasonable \nopportunity to respond to those allegations before a removal order is issued. \n \nIt is important for the MD to make notes detailing the process followed in exercising their \ndecision-making powers. Where the MD is utilizing the case highlights form (BSF516 or \nIMM5084B) to record their decision, the form should be completed in as much detail as \npossible). \n \nFor further detail on procedures during in-person proceedings, see Appendix C: Steps to be \ncompleted during in-person A44(2) proceedings where the MD has jurisdiction to issue a \nremoval order.  \n                                                           \naction which breaches Charter rights, whereas subsection 52(1) would apply where legislation is found to \nbe invalid. MDs are not considered a court of competent jurisdiction and therefore cannot grant a remedy \nunder section 24 of the Charter.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n30 \n2025-02-20 \n10.2 Types of administrative removal orders  \n \nThe IRPA and IRPR contain provisions regarding the issuance of removal orders for persons \nwho are found to be inadmissible on one of the grounds listed in the IRPA.   \n \nR223 provides for three types of removal orders that may be issued: \n \n \ndeparture order;  \n \nexclusion order; and \n \ndeportation order.  \n \nR228 specifies the type of removal order that the MD is authorized to make in prescribed \ncircumstances for certain inadmissibility provisions. It is important to note that the Regulations \ndo not distinguish between removal orders that are in force under the IRPA and those that are \nnot (conditional) and it is A49 which specifies when removal orders come into force. \n \nTable 5:   Types of removal orders  \n \nDeparture Order \nR224(2) \n \nRequires the person to leave Canada within 30 days after the \norder becomes enforceable. \n \nBecomes a deportation order by operation of law when the person \ndoes not meet the requirements set out under R240(1)(a) to (c) \nwithin 30 days after the order becomes enforceable.  \nExclusion Order \nR225 \n \nA person who has been removed on an exclusion order cannot \nreturn to Canada for one (1) year* unless the person obtains the \nrequired written authorization to return \n*If the exclusion order issued as a result of the application of \nA40(2)(a) (misrepresentation), the exclusion period is five (5) \nyears \nDeportation Order \nR226 \n \nPermanently bars the person from returning to Canada, unless the \nperson obtains the required written authorization to return \n10.3 Permanent residents and their residency obligation— R228(2) \n \nPursuant to the IRPR, the MD has the authority to issue removal orders against permanent \nresidents only in cases where the inadmissibility is based on a failure to comply with the \nresidency obligations under A28. The authority of the MD does not include the issuance of \nremoval orders for permanent residents on other grounds of inadmissibility.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n31 \n2025-02-20 \nBefore the MD issues a departure order against a permanent resident, paragraph A28(2)(c) \nspecifically requires the MD to determine whether humanitarian and compassionate \nconsiderations, including the best interests of any child affected by the decision, overcome any \nbreach of the residency obligation.   \n \nThe MD is required to consider all information presented by the permanent resident on a case-\nby-case basis. The following are examples of considerations the MD may consider in \ndetermining whether humanitarian and compassionate grounds justify the retention of \npermanent resident status. The MD is to consider circumstances and events that occurred in the \nlast five-year period which led to the permanent resident’s non-compliance with the residency \nobligation. \n \nExamples of factors to weigh under A28(2)(c) \n \ni.  Extent of non-compliance: \n \n \nWhat is the number of days of physical presence in Canada within the five-year period \nunder examination? \n \nWas any period of time outside of Canada due to a medical condition or the medical \ncondition of a close family member? Could alternative arrangements for the care of the \nfamily member have been made?  \n \nii. Circumstances beyond the person’s control: \n \n \nAre the circumstances for remaining outside of Canada compelling? \n \nWere there circumstances which prevented the permanent resident from returning to \nCanada? \n \nHas the permanent resident returned to Canada at the earliest opportunity? \n \nDid the permanent resident leave as a child accompanying a dependent?  If so, is the \npermanent resident returning at the earliest possible opportunity?  Did the permanent \nresident accompany a parent because of a mental or physical disability? \n \niii. Establishment in and outside Canada: \n \n \nIs the permanent resident a citizen or permanent resident of another country? \n \nHas the permanent resident taken steps to establish permanence in a country other than \nCanada? \n \nTo what degree is the permanent resident established in Canada? \n \nWhat ties to Canada has the permanent resident maintained? \n \niv. Presence and degree of consequential hardship: \n \n \nWhat is the degree of hardship caused by the loss of permanent resident status in \nrelation to the permanent resident’s personal circumstances?  What is the impact on \nfamily members, especially children?\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n32 \n2025-02-20 \n10.4 Removal order for refugee claimants— R228(3) \n \nR228(3) provides that where a removal order issued with respect to a person who has made a \nclaim for refugee protection which has been determined to be eligible to be referred to the \nRefugee Protection Division (RPD) or no eligibility determination has been made, a departure \norder is the applicable removal order in prescribed circumstances. \n \nA49(2) provides that a removal order made against a refugee protection claimant is conditional \nand prescribes the circumstances under which the removal order will come into force.  \n \nNote:  MDs should keep in mind that there are special procedures for vulnerable persons and  \nrefer to the IRCC Program delivery instructions on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee \nprotection of minors and vulnerable persons. \n10.5 Dual intent  \n \nA22(2) states that the intention of a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not \npreclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that the person will \nleave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.  \n \nDual intent is present when a foreign national who has applied for permanent residence in \nCanada (or is entitled to apply for permanent residence within Canada) also seeks to enter \nCanada for a temporary period as a visitor, worker or student. If an officer has concerns/doubts \nabout the foreign national’s bona fides, the foreign national must be made aware of these \nconcerns and given an opportunity to respond to them.  \n \nSome examples of dual intent could include: \n \n \na foreign national frequently visiting a Canadian spouse who has complied with previous \nconditions of entry and is otherwise not inadmissible, even if an application for \npermanent residence has not yet been submitted; \n \na foreign national who has applied or intends to apply for permanent residence, but is \nvisiting Canada to assess employment opportunities, setting up household, etc. \nThe Federal Court in Rebmann v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2005 FC 301 held that an officer \nis required to take into account the foreign national's dual intent in entering/remaining in Canada \nas a temporary resident and provide analysis of the relevant evidence with regards to the \nforeign national’s intention to establish permanent residence in Canada to show that the foreign \nnational will not leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay as a temporary \nresident. \n \nOfficers and MDs should distinguish between a foreign national whose intentions are bona fide \nand a foreign national who has no intention of leaving Canada at the end of their authorized stay \nif the application for permanent residence is refused.  \n \nThe possibility that a foreign national may, at some point in the future, be approved for \npermanent residence does not absolve the individual from meeting the requirements of a \ntemporary resident, specifically, to leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for their \nstay, in accordance with section R179.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n33 \n2025-02-20 \nIn assessing the foreign national’s intentions, officers and MDs should weigh all the factors \nrelevant to the case, including the length of time the applicant has spent in Canada, the means \nof support; obligations and ties in the home country, previous compliance with requirements of \nthe IRPA and any compassionate circumstances of the person concerned. These factors should \nbe considered before proceeding with administrative enforcement action under A44(1) or \nA44(2).   \n \nOfficers are reminded to use their own judgment and the flexibility afforded to them by \nsubsection A22(2) when making decisions on cases where the foreign national also has the \nintention to become a permanent resident. \n \nFor further guidance on assessing dual intent considerations, see IRCC Program delivery \ninstructions on Dual intent.  See also:  ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n10.6 Restoration of status \n \nR182 describes a mechanism by which a visitor, worker or student who has lost temporary \nresident status for having failed to comply with any of the conditions imposed under R185(a), \nR185(b)(i) to (iii) or R185(c), may nevertheless submit an application within the 90-day period of \nthe loss of their status, and if eligible have that status restored.  \n \nIt is important to note that under the D & D instruments, only IRCC officials have the authority to \nconsider an application for restoration of status. \n \nThe application submitted to IRCC shall be approved if the processing officer is satisfied that the \nforeign national continues to meet the initial requirements of their stay, and has not failed to \ncomply with any other conditions imposed and is not the subject of a declaration made under \nA22.1. It is to be noted that an officer shall not restore the status of a student if the student is not \nin compliance with a condition set out in R220.1(1). \n \nNote:  If a temporary resident has applied for an extension of their authorized status before the \nstatus expires, they are considered to have maintained status (formerly referred to as “implied \nstatus”) until a decision is made on their application. Maintained status works by operation of \nlaw [R183(5)], and the temporary resident cannot be reported for non-compliance until a \ndecision is made on their application for an extension, unless other IRPA inadmissibilities are \npresent. For further details regarding procedures for persons with maintained status, see IRCC \nProgram delivery instructions on Temporary residents: Maintained status during processing \n(previously called implied status). \n \nThe following guidelines must be taken into account by Inland Enforcement Officers and MDs \nprior to taking enforcement action in such cases:  \nScenario 1:  Foreign national is out of status, but has applied for restoration of status \nwithin the 90-day period and is otherwise admissible – decision pending \n \nForeign nationals who have submitted an application to have their status restored within the 90-\nday period, and who are not inadmissible under any other section of the Act or Regulations, \nshould not be subject to an A44(1) report. In such circumstances, officers and MDs must allow \nfor a decision to be rendered by IRCC before taking enforcement action, an approach which is \nconsistent with the Federal Court’s findings in Sui v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and \nEmergency Preparedness), 2006 FC 1314.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n34 \n2025-02-20 \nScenario 2:  Foreign national is out of status and has not applied for restoration of status \nbut is still within 90-day eligibility period \n \nWhile there is nothing in the IRPA or the Regulations that prohibits an officer from writing an \nA44(1) report or an MD from issuing an exclusion order during the 90-day restoration period \nwhere no application for restoration has yet been made, officers and MDs should consider \nwhether or not to pursue enforcement action in such cases. After taking appropriate steps to \nensure that a restoration application has not been made, should an officer decide to write an \nA44(1) report and refer it to the MD for review, the officer should articulate their reasoning in \npursuing enforcement action in the decision, if such action is pursued prior to the expiration of \nthe 90-day eligibility period.  \n \nWhere the MD receives an A44(1) report for non-compliance within the 90-day restoration \nperiod where the foreign national has not filed an application but is otherwise admissible, the \nMD must then consider R182 and has the discretion to hold the report in abeyance until the 90-\nday eligibility period has lapsed. If the MD decides to proceed with the A44(2) review, the MD \nshould verify whether a restoration application has been or will be filed, and must consider all \nthe circumstances of the case, including the fact that the foreign national is within the 90-day \nrestoration period.   \n \nThis approach is consistent with the Federal Court’s decision in Ouedraogo v. Canada (Public \nSafety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FC 810 where the Court noted that the discretion \nof a MD to issue an exclusion order and the ability of a foreign national to apply for restoration of \nstatus are not mutually exclusive – both can occur at the same time. The Court found that the \nsimple existence of an application for restoration does not in and of itself shield a foreign \nnational against enforcement action. In short, where an application for restoration is made, \nalthough the existence of the application should be taken into consideration by the MD when \nthey are exercising their discretion, there is nothing prohibiting the MD from nonetheless making \nan inadmissibility finding where the foreign national is found to be non-compliant with the \nrequirements set out in R185. \n \nIn order to adhere to the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice, officers and MDs \nmust consider each case on its own merits and may consider the following: \n \n \nDoes the foreign national state that they wish to remain in Canada and for what \npurpose? \n \nHas the foreign national already made arrangements to depart Canada in the immediate \nfuture? \n \nIs the foreign national evasive about their departure plans or the intent to remain in \nCanada? \n \nHas the foreign national otherwise been in compliance with the terms and conditions of \ntheir temporary resident status? \n \nIf the foreign national has not applied for a restoration of status, is the officer/MD \nsatisfied that the foreign national will appear for future immigration interviews and/or \ndepart Canada voluntarily? \n \nIf the officer/MD is satisfied that the foreign national will seek to remedy lapsed status \nwithin the 90-day period, then the officer/MD may wish to allow the 90-day application \nperiod to lapse before reviewing the case again in consideration of enforcement action.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n35 \n2025-02-20 \n \nScenario 3:  Foreign national is out of status beyond the 90-day restoration of status \neligibility period, or is otherwise inadmissible under the IRPA or Regulations \n \nIf an officer encounters a foreign national who has overstayed their authorized period of stay \nbeyond the 90-day eligibility period for applying for restoration of status, or where the foreign \nnational is otherwise inadmissible under the IRPA or Regulations, the officer may pursue \nappropriate enforcement action, which includes writing an A44(1) report and referring it to the \nMD for a review under A44(2). \n10.7 Procedure: Reviewing A44(1) reports when a Minister’s Delegate is not on \nsite  \n \nOfficers cannot prepare and then review their own A44(1) report under the IRPA. In those \ncircumstances where a MD is not physically on-site and/or otherwise available to conduct a \nreview under A44(2) in person and deferring the proceeding is not a viable option, officers must \ncontact an off-site MD for the purpose of reviewing the A44(1) report and conducting a \ndetermination under A44(2) by telephone or videoconference.  \n \nIn all A44(2) reviews not conducted in person, the MD will need to review the A44(1) report in \nGCMS as well as any case notes or accompanying documents that the officer has uploaded into \nGCMS. The officer who contacts the MD must also ensure that their recommendation and any \nsupporting evidence has also been provided to the MD prior to the commencement of the \nA44(2) proceeding. The officer must also make notes during the MD review and fully document \nthe procedural steps taken throughout all stages of the proceedings.  \n \nThe MD is required to follow all steps for conducting the MD review and enter detailed \nexamination or application notes into the GCMS that fully support the decision being made. MDs \nmay refer to section 22 of this manual chapter, ‘Entering MD decisions into GCMS’. Where the \nMD also makes handwritten notes during the proceedings, these should be forwarded to the \nofficer holding the file and/or uploaded into GCMS. \n \nIn those cases where the MD has jurisdiction to issue a removal order, officers and MDs must \nbe particularly diligent in ensuring that all matters relating to natural justice and procedural \nfairness are satisfied and documented in notes. \n \nIn cases where the MD has jurisdiction to issue a removal order and if, for any reason, the \nopportunity does not exist for the person concerned to communicate directly with the MD, or if \nthe MD is of the opinion that the person concerned does not truly appreciate the nature of the \nproceedings, then the A44(2) proceeding must be postponed until a MD is physically on site to \nconduct the A44(2) review in person.  \n \nIf the MD makes a decision to issue a removal order pursuant to R228, the MD will enter the \ndecision into GCMS and the officer who has the person concerned before them can print the \nremoval order and provide it to the person concerned.  \n \nNote: If, for any reason, the MD has made a decision not to proceed with or otherwise continue \nthe MD review under A44(2), the officer is not to contact other MDs.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n36 \n2025-02-20 \n10.8 Procedure: Issuing removal orders to persons in absentia \n \nIn absentia is Latin for \"in the absence of\".  \n \nIn the context of A44(2), the practical application of an in absentia proceeding will be in those \nexceptional circumstances when persons who are subject to an A44(2) Minister’s proceeding \nhave a removal order made against them without being present at the time the removal order is \nissued. \n \nA55(1) allows for the issuance of a warrant for the arrest and detention of a foreign national or \npermanent resident where there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is inadmissible \nand unlikely to appear “at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by \nthe Minister under subsection 44(2)”.   \n \nAs officers have the authority to issue a warrant for a person unlikely to appear at A44(2) \nproceedings in cases where the MD has jurisdiction to issue the removal order, removal orders \nshould not be issued in absentia, unless under exceptional circumstances. These cases will \nbe rare, and each will need to be assessed on an individual basis taking into consideration all \nrelevant information before proceeding with an in absentia proceeding.  \n \nThe following scenario illustrates an example of exceptional circumstances where an in absentia \nproceeding may be reasonable. \n \nScenario: \n \nA foreign national entered Canada as a member of a crew and shortly after deserted \ntheir vessel. The crew member did not report to CBSA or IRCC within the specified time \nframes under the Regulations and was reported under A44(1). In an attempt to locate \nthe person in Canada, all investigative leads were exhausted. The A44(2) proceeding \nwas held in absentia and after reviewing all the evidence, the report was determined to \nbe well-founded and the person was issued a removal order and a warrant for removal. \n \nThis approach is consistent with the FCA’s findings in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. \nJayamaha Mudalige Don, 2014 FCA 4. While the FCA concluded that it was open to the MD to \nissue the removal order, the court’s finding that procedural fairness was not breached was \nbased on the specific facts of the case (i.e., immigration officials had NO contact information for \nthe person, more than 72 hours had elapsed from the time when the person deserted his ship \nand subparagraph 228(1)(c)(v) of the Regulations expressly provided for the issuance of a \nremoval order). It is important to note that the FCA placed great weight on the fact that the \nperson concerned had an obligation to report to CBSA or IRCC and failed to do so and the \ncoordinates of the person concerned in that case were NOT known to CBSA/IRCC and \ntherefore the person was incapable of being notified.   \n \nNotification when scheduling A44(2) proceedings \n \nNot all A44(2) proceedings will take place on the same day that the A44(1) report is written, for \nnumber of reasons. In some cases, a person may be reported pursuant to A44(1), and the \nreview of that report by a MD will not take place until a MD is available. In these situations, \nreasonable efforts shall be made to notify the person to appear and provide an opportunity to be \nheard at the A44(2) proceeding. ‘Reasonable efforts' will vary from case to case depending on\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n37 \n2025-02-20 \nthe nature of the case, type of information available and the level of engagement with the \nperson concerned. \n \n \nWhere the person's address is known, officers shall provide written notice in-person or \nmail, depending on the circumstances, by completing a Notice to Appear for a \nProceeding under A44(2) [IMM 1234B or BSF504]. This form will provide notice of the \nlocation, date and time of the A44(2) Minister's proceeding; legal authority to conduct the \nproceeding; and consequences of failing to appear at the proceeding. Other relevant \ninformation such as a copy of the A44(1) report which sets out the allegation(s) and \ncontact information should also be provided. \n \nIf the notice is being mailed, reasonable efforts shall be made to verify the accuracy of \nthe person's address; this includes querying and updating databases. Reasonable time \nand opportunity shall be provided to the person to allow for attendance at the A44(2) \nproceeding. \n \nFailure to Appear at 44(2) Proceedings \n \n \nIf the person fails to attend on the date specified, the MD conducting the review shall \nadjourn the proceeding. Reasonable efforts shall be made to determine the reasons for \nthe no-show (e.g. letter to the last known address, site visit and/or telephone call). \n \nIn some circumstances, there will be valid excuses as to why the person failed to \nappear. The onus will be on the person to show cause for not appearing at the \nproceeding. Officers shall make a determination as to whether the explanation is \nreasonable and attempt to communicate the results of that determination to the person. \n \nIf satisfied of the explanation for not attending the proceeding, a second written notice \n[IMM 1234B or BSF504] will be delivered in-person or by mail, depending on the \ncircumstances. Officers must clearly write or otherwise indicate \"second notice\" on the \nform. \n \nIf, following the second call-in notice there is no communication from the person \nconcerned and/or their legal representative explaining their absence and if the \ninadmissibility allegation falls within the MD’s jurisdiction to issue a removal order \n(R228), the MD may pursue the issuance of an arrest warrant for being unlikely to \nappear for an A44(2) proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order. \n \nFor allegations where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order rests with the ID, it is open \nto the MD to refer the A44(1) report to ID for an admissibility hearing and consider \nissuing a warrant for admissibility hearing pursuant to A55(1) (see ENF 7 Immigration \nInvestigations and IRPA s.55 Arrests/Detention for further details). \n \nNote: IRCC officers may refer cases for warrant issuance to CBSA for review. All such \nreferrals must include all details of attempts made to contact the person concerned and \ncopies of all call-in notices sent and case notes. \n \nIn exceptional cases where there is detailed information on file that the person \nconcerned was aware of the A44(2) proceeding (e.g., person was served with the call-in \nnotice in-person and understood the consequences, the A44(2) proceeding was initiated \nby the MD but had to be postponed due to unavailability of the person’s counsel and the \nperson concerned was fully aware of the new date, etc.) the MD may proceed to conduct \na review under A44(2) in absentia.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n38 \n2025-02-20 \n \nIn those exceptional cases where the MD proceeds with the A44(2) review in absentia, \nthe MD will be required to conduct a paper review of the A44(1) report with all relevant \nevidence available at the time of the A44(2) review. If, after such review, the MD \ndetermines the A44(1) report to be well-founded, and if all grounds of inadmissibility are \nthose for which the MD has jurisdiction, a removal order may be made against the \nperson concerned even though the person is not present at the time the removal order is \nissued. \n10.9 A44(1) reports for inadmissible family members \n \nUnder A42, accompanying and non-accompanying family members may be inadmissible to \nCanada under prescribed circumstances. This provision may only apply to family members who \nare foreign nationals, other than protected persons. \n \nWhere an officer writes an A44(1) report against a family member for inadmissibility under A42, \nthe MD has jurisdiction under R228 to issue the applicable removal order.  Officers and MDs \nshould note, however, that for the purposes of A52(1), the making of a removal order against a \nforeign national on the basis of inadmissibility under A42 is a prescribed circumstance that does \nnot oblige the foreign national to obtain the authorization of an officer in order to return to \nCanada.  \n \nIt is important to note that A42 may only form the basis of an A44(1) report when the person is \ninadmissible under sections A34, A35, A35.1, or A37. \n \nProcedure to include family members on ID removal order \n \nR227 sets out that, for the purposes of section 42 of the Act, a report prepared under A44(1)  \nagainst a foreign national is also a report against the foreign national’s family members in \nCanada.  \n \nR227(2) provides that, in the case of a removal order made by the ID against a foreign national \nwho has family members in Canada, the removal order issued by the ID against a foreign \nnational may also be made effective against the family members without the need for a separate \ninadmissibility report provided that an officer informed the family member(s): \n \nof the report; \n \nthat they are the subject of an admissibility hearing and, consequently, have the right to \nmake submissions and be represented, at their own expense, at the admissibility \nhearing; and \n \nthat they are inadmissible under A42 on grounds of being an inadmissible family \nmember. \n \nWhile this procedural avenue may be available under the Regulations, it is generally \nrecommended that where an officer decides to pursue enforcement action against inadmissible \nfamily members of a foreign national under A42, the officer should proceed by way of writing a \nseparate A44(1) inadmissibility report for each family member after the removal order has been \nmade against the foreign national. It is also to be noted that this avenue is not available in cases \ninvolving allegations within the jurisdiction of the MD.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n39 \n2025-02-20 \n \nNote:  the MD only has the authority to issue removal orders against persons against whom an \nA44(1) report has been written. The MD cannot include family members in an administrative \nremoval order relating to another member of the family.  \n10.10 Procedure: Removal orders following vacation or cessation of \nrefugee/protected person status by RPD  \n \nR228(1)(b) allows the MD to issue removal orders to foreign nationals who are inadmissible for \nmisrepresentation under A40(1)(c) on a final determination by the RPD to vacate a decision to \nallow the person’s claim for refugee protection or application for protection pursuant to A109.   \n \nUnder A109(1), the RPD may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim \nfor refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly \nmisrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.   \n \nR228(1)(b.1) allows the MD to issue removal orders to foreign nationals who are inadmissible \nunder A40.1(1) on a final determination by the RPD under A108(2) that the refugee protection of \nthe foreign national has ceased (i.e., cessation of refugee protection).   \n \nPursuant to A46 a person loses permanent resident status on a final determination by the RPD:  \n \n \nto vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection or application for protection \n[A46(1)(d)]; or  \n \nthat their refugee protection has ceased under A108(2) for any of the reasons described \nin paragraphs A108(1)(a) to (d) [A46(1)(c.1)]. \nThe MD should only issue the applicable removal order once all court challenges to the decision \nby the RPD to vacate the refugee protection claim or cease refugee protection have been \nexhausted and are resolved.  \n \nNote: following a decision of the RPD that refugee protection has ceased under A108(2), the \nMinister may not simply rely on a previous removal order (issued against the person before \nprotected person status was granted) to remove that person. In other words, a new A44(1) \nreport based on inadmissibility under A40.1(1) would need to be written and a new removal \norder would need to be issued by the MD in these circumstances. \n \nFollowing a decision by the RPD to vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection or \ncease refugee protection, the foreign national has 15 days to apply for leave to the Federal \nCourt for a judicial review as stipulated in A72(2). Therefore, the MD shall wait a minimum of 22 \ndays (seven days for receipt of a decision sent by mail and 15 days for the application under \nA72(2)) before issuing the removal order following the writing of an A44(1) report for \ninadmissibility under A40(1)(c) or A40.1(1).  \n \nWhere an application for leave to the Federal Court has been filed, the MD shall wait until the \nfinal decision is rendered and all legal means of challenging the decision have been exhausted \nand resolved. Prior to issuing the removal order, the MD shall ensure that no litigation regarding \nthe RPD decision remains outstanding and that the minimum period of time to file an extension \nof time has elapsed without an application. The MD should seek the assistance of the regional\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n40 \n2025-02-20 \nJustice Liaison officer with respect to the status of litigation and any issues regarding extensions \nof time. \n \n \n11 Temporary resident permits (TRPs) \n \nIn some cases, a designated officer may exercise their authority under A24(1) to issue a TRP to \nallow a foreign national who is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements of the IRPA to \nenter or remain in Canada where it is justified in the circumstances. TRPs are always issued at \nthe discretion of the designated authority and may be cancelled at any time. \n \nThe authority to issue a TRP is determined by the IRCC Designation and Delegation (D & D) \nInstrument and depends on the nature of the allegation.  \n \nNote:  For CBSA, TRPs may only be issued by designated officials at the port of entry \nThere are instances where the person who has the delegated authority to review the A44 report \n(the MD) does not have the designated authority to issue a TRP.  In such cases, the official with \nauthority to review the report (i.e., the MD) may make a recommendation to the person with the \ndesignated authority to issue a TRP.  \n \nOfficers and MDs may recommend or issue TRPs only in accordance with the Act and \nRegulations, and must follow the IRCC Program delivery instructions on Temporary resident \npermits. In all cases, officers and MDs must leave a record, which includes detailed notes \nentries in GCMS, of their decision or recommendation. For further information, see ENF 4 Port \nof entry examinations. \n \nTRPs should only be issued after careful consideration of all assessment factors as the \ndocument carries privileges greater than those accorded to other visitors, students and workers \nwith temporary resident status. Before issuing a TRP, officials must consult the departmental \nand agency guidelines on risk assessment factors and procedures for issuing TRPs. This \napplies to both initial and subsequent TRPs. \n \nWhere an officer does not have the authority to issue a TRP but has reviewed the case and is \nrecommending the issuance of a TRP, the officer must prepare a written a case summary that \nincludes a recommendation for a final decision. The officer will refer the case file to the decision-\nmaker with the designated authority to issue a TRP for a final determination. If the decision is \nmade to issue a TRP, the decision-maker will determine the period of validity of the TRP.  \n \nFor further instructions and procedures for TRPs, officers must refer to the IRCC Program \ndelivery Instructions on Temporary resident permits and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \nAdditional considerations for TRP issuance: \n \nA person is not eligible for a TRP if less than 12 months have passed since their \nclaim for refugee protection was last rejected [or determined to be withdrawn or \nabandoned as described under subsection A24(4)]. \nException: The one-year ban on accessing a TRP under A24(4) does not bar an \nIRCC officer, on their own initiative, from considering a TRP for a victim of human \ntrafficking.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n41 \n2025-02-20 \n \nThere are specific IRCC policy guidelines respecting certain vulnerable persons \nincluding suspected or known victims of human trafficking and victims of family \nviolence. Only IRCC officials may issue TRPs to victims of human trafficking or victims \nof family violence, however CBSA officials should follow the procedures set out in the \nProgram delivery instructions above for handling these cases. \n \nIf a student, worker or visitor with valid temporary resident status is reported \nunder subsection A44(1) but a decision is made not to hold an admissibility hearing or \nissue a removal order, that person remains a temporary resident, and a TRP is not \nrequired. \n \n12 Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed to \nleave (Port of entry cases)   \n \nUnder R42, the officer who examines a foreign national who is seeking to enter Canada and \nwho has indicated that they want to withdraw their application to enter Canada shall allow the \nforeign national to withdraw their application, unless R42(2) applies. \n \nR42(2) provides that a foreign national shall not be allowed to withdraw their application to enter \nCanada where a report under A44(1) is being prepared or has been prepared, unless the MD \ndoes not make a removal order or refer the report to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  \nIn other words, once an officer writes an A44(1) report, the allowed to leave option may only be \nexercised at the MD level.   \n \nIn exercising their discretion, the MD should consider whether the objectives of the IRPA are \nbetter served by allowing the person to voluntarily withdraw their application to enter Canada \npursuant to R42 in the circumstances of the case. \n \nR42(3) provides that foreign nationals who are allowed to withdraw their application to enter \nCanada must appear without delay at a port of entry to verify their departure from Canada. \nIf a person is allowed to leave Canada voluntarily, the officer or MD must give the person an \nAllowed to Leave Canada form (IMM 1282B). \n \nFor further details regarding allowing persons to leave/withdraw their application to enter \nCanada:  see ENF 5, section 9. 4, ‘Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed \nto leave (Port of entry cases)’ and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \n \n13 Procedure: Handling possible claims for refugee protection \n \nAlthough there is no requirement in the IRPA for the MD to ask whether the subject of a \ndetermination wishes to make a claim for refugee protection, the MD should be aware of \nCanada's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, \nand under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment. \n \nA99(3) excludes persons under a removal order from making a claim for refugee protection. \nTherefore, the MD must ensure, before issuing a removal order under A44(2), that this would\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n42 \n2025-02-20 \nnot be contrary to the spirit of Canada’s obligations, even when the individual does not explicitly \nrequest access to the refugee determination process.  \n \nIt must also be recognized that some people who may have a legitimate need of Canada’s \nprotection are unaware of the provision for claiming refugee status.  \nHandling a possible claim for refugee protection:  \n \nWhere the subject of a determination for an administrative removal order has not made a \nclaim, the MD should ask them how long they intend to remain in Canada (port of entry \ncases) or when they intend to return to their home country (inland cases) or if there are \nany reasons why they are unable or unwilling to return to their home country. \n \nIf the person indicates that their intention is or was to remain temporarily, the MD should \nproceed with the removal order decision and issue the removal order, if appropriate. \n \nIf the person indicates that their intention is or was to remain in Canada indefinitely, the \nMD is to inquire about their motives for leaving their country of nationality/home country \nand the consequences of returning there before making a decision on issuing a removal \norder. \n \nWhere the responses indicate a fear of returning to the country that may relate to \nrefugee protection, the MD is to inform the person of the definition of a “Convention \nrefugee” or “person in need of protection” as found in A96 and A97, and ask whether \nthey wish to make a claim. \n \nWhere the person indicates an intention not to make a claim, the MD should proceed \nwith the decision and issue a removal order, if appropriate. \n \nWhere the person is uncertain, the MD should inform them that they will not be able to \nmake a claim for refugee protection after a removal order has been issued [A99(3)], and \nprovide them with an opportunity to make the claim before proceeding with a removal \norder decision. \n \nIf the person does not express an intent to make a claim, despite the explanation that \nthis is their last opportunity, the MD should proceed with the decision and issue the \nremoval order, if appropriate. \n \nWhenever the person indicates a fear of returning to their home country, the MD is to \nrefrain from evaluating whether the fear is well-founded. As well, the MD must not \nspeculate on  eligibility before the claim is made or speculate on the processing time or \neventual outcome of a claim. \nThese procedures do not preclude any person from making a claim for refugee protection at any \ntime before a removal order is issued, regardless of the responses provided to the officer.  \nIn order to address concerns that may arise subsequent to the issuance of a removal order, it is \nimportant that the notes accurately reflect—in detail—the questions asked and the information \nprovided by the person during the A44 proceedings. \nFor further information on processing refugee claims, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \nSee also:  PPI  In-Canada claims for refugee protection; IRCC Program delivery instructions on \nProcessing in-Canada claims for refugee protection: Post-interview processing and final \ndecision.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n43 \n2025-02-20 \n14 Persons claiming to be Canadian citizens or registered Indians \nunder the Indian Act \n \nUnder the IRPA, Canadian citizens and persons registered as Indians under the Indian Act have \nan unqualified right to enter and remain in Canada and are not subject to the inadmissibility \nprovisions of IRPA. Therefore, before writing an A44(1) report, an officer should have evidence \nto confirm that the person does not hold such status.  \n \nIn cases of permanent residents, officers must confirm through the appropriate queries that the \nperson has not obtained Canadian citizenship and ensure that due diligence has been \nexercised before proceeding with further enforcement action.  \n \nShould the MD detect the possibility of Canadian citizenship or registered Indian status during \nthe A44(2) proceedings, the MD shall cause an investigation of the matter to be initiated before \nmaking any removal order or referring the case to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  \n \n \n15 Cases where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order rests with \nthe Immigration Division  \n \nIn cases where the MD does not have jurisdiction to issue a removal order, the MD must \ndetermine whether to refer the A44(1) report to the ID if satisfied that the report is well-founded. \nAt the end of the admissibility hearing, if satisfied that the person is inadmissible, the member of \nthe ID shall, pursuant to A45(d), make the applicable removal order against the foreign national \nor permanent resident pursuant to R229. \nBefore forming an opinion that a report is well-founded and referring it to the ID for an \nadmissibility hearing, the MD must assess the case on its own merits. At the time of the MD’s \nassessment, the MD should have before them all submissions and documents filed by the \nperson concerned as well as any evidence relied on by the reporting officer in their \nrecommendation under A44(1). \nThis section is intended to assist officers in making decisions that are consistent with the \nobjectives of the IRPA; it is not intended to restrict the MD in the lawful exercise of their \ndiscretion. What follows are guidelines only.  \n15.1 A44(1) reports for criminality cases \nIn Medovarski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration); Esteban v. Canada (Minister \nof Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 51, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) stated that \nthe objectives in the IRPA reflect an intent to prioritize security and that this objective is given \neffect by removing persons with criminal records from Canada. The SCC noted that in drafting \nthe IRPA, Parliament demonstrated a strong desire to treat criminals less leniently than under \nthe former Immigration Act. This was noted in Sharma, where the FCA affirmed that officers and \nMDs, when dealing with matters under A44(1) and A44(2), must always be mindful of the \nvarious objectives of the IRPA, in particular A3(1)(h) and (i). The FCA also concluded that the \nCourt’s rationale in Cha in support of a limited discretion under A44 would appear to apply \nequally to both foreign nationals and permanent residents. \nThe MD should also be cognizant of how evidence of pending or existing charges was relied on \nby the reporting officer during the A44(1) assessment; the MD should be careful about how such\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n44 \n2025-02-20 \nevidence is relied on in the A44(2) decision. The MD must also be careful not to rely on \nconvictions for which an application for rehabilitation or a record suspension has been granted \nas evidence of a criminal record.  For further information, see ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports, \nsection 12.2,  ‘Evidence of pending or withdrawn charges’. \n15.2 A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents of Canada  \nAs mentioned in section 8 above, the courts15 have confirmed that officers and MD’s making \ndecisions under A44 have no obligation to consider H&C-like factors or ‘personal \ncircumstances’ once inadmissibility is established by the evidence.  \n \nNote: this section does not apply to PR residency obligation cases reported under A41(b). \nBefore the MD issues a departure order against a permanent resident under R228(2), \nparagraph A28(2)(c) specifically requires the MD to determine whether humanitarian and \ncompassionate considerations, including the best interests of any child affected by the decision, \novercome any breach of the residency obligation [refer to section 10.3 Permanent residents and \ntheir residency obligation— R228(2)”]. \n \nDuring the course of A44 proceedings, however, an officer or MD may receive evidence or \nsubmissions relating to a permanent resident or protected person’s personal circumstances and \nwhy a removal order should not be sought. \nWhile the courts have affirmed that an MD is not required to consider personal circumstances, \nbut if the MD does, such an assessment must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. \nThis means that if an MD exercises their discretion to consider personal factors, the assessment \nmust be reasonable and the reasoning articulated. Where these factors are considered and \nrejected, an explanation of how these factors were assessed should be provided, even if only \nvery brief in nature.16 An MD must ensure that the decision as a whole is “justifiable, \ntransparent, and intelligible”17.  \nWhere the officer at A44(1) has exercised their discretion to consider personal circumstances in \ntheir recommendation, the MD must consider this information and explain in their decision \nwhether or not they concur with the officer’s recommendation. To clarify, the MD is not bound by \nthe A44(1) officer’s recommendation. For example, if the officer at A44(1) did NOT exercise \ntheir discretion to consider personal circumstances, this does not prevent the MD from \nexercising that discretion to consider such factors in the A44(2) decision. \nMDs should also provide reasons for giving more weight to certain documents over others \nwhere there is conflicting or inconsistent information before them. For example, where there are \nconflicting versions of events pertaining to a criminal offence, an explanation as to why one \nversion is being relied on over the other should be provided. \n                                                           \n15 Obazughanmwen v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FCA 151; Sidhu v. \nCanada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FC 1681; Matharu v. Canada (Public Safety \nand Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 902  \n16 McAlpin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 422 \n17 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 SCR 653 [Vavilov]  \nwherein the SCC further affirmed at para. 85 that a reasonable decision is “one that is based on an \ninternally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that \nconstrain the decision maker”.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n45 \n2025-02-20 \nWhether to consider personal circumstances for permanent residents and protected \npersons   \nAs confirmed by the courts18, MDs are not obligated to consider personal circumstances during \nthe A44 process. However, the courts have also affirmed that MDs retain the discretion to \nconsider these circumstances, and if they exercise their discretion to do so, the decision must \nbe reasonable. The discretion is tempered by their limited role at A44.19 The guidance in this \nsection is intended to assist MDs determine when and how to exercise such discretion. \n \nMDs must always keep in mind the principles set out in section 8.2 and 15.1 above when \nrendering decisions under A44, including Parliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make \nsecurity of Canadians a top priority.  \n \nIn consideration of the various objectives of the IRPA and the limited discretion at A44 as \nconfirmed by the courts, the CBSA’s policy is that MDs must consider the factors below when \ndeciding whether or not to exercise their limited discretion to consider evidence or submissions \nfiled by the person concerned regarding personal circumstances.  \nGenerally speaking, the following factors would weigh against consideration of personal \ncircumstances by the MD: \n \nthe inadmissibility falls under section A34, A35, A35.1 or A37;   \n \n \nA36(1) serious criminality cases in the following circumstances: \no the permanent resident or protected person was previously issued a \nwarning letter by CBSA or had a previous removal order stayed or \nquashed by the IAD on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; \no the reportable offence:  involved violence that resulted in bodily or \npsychological harm to another person, the use of a firearm or is a sexual \noffence; was committed against a vulnerable person (e.g. minor child or \nintellectually or physically challenged persons, or senior citizen), was a \nracially motivated crime, a crime of gender-based violence, including \ndomestic violence, a hate crime or a crime involving trafficking or \nsmuggling in large quantities of a controlled substance or weapons;  \no the criminal record of the permanent resident or protected person \ndemonstrates a pattern of escalating seriousness \n \nIf the decision is not to consider personal circumstances, the MD should state this in their \nA44(2) decision. For example, the MD may state in their decision: “I am not exercising my \ndiscretion to consider evidence and/or submissions filed on behalf of (name of person \nconcerned) pertaining to their personal circumstances given the seriousness of the reportable \noffence”.  \n \n                                                           \n18 Obazughanmwen v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FCA 151; Sidhu v. \nCanada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FC 1681; Matharu v. Canada (Public Safety \nand Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 902 \n19 Dass v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 624\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n46 \n2025-02-20 \nIf the MD exercises discretion to consider personal circumstances \nIf the MD decides to consider the personal circumstances of the person concerned, the CBSA’s \npolicy is that the MD must balance these with the objectives of the IRPA to protect public health \nand safety, and maintain the security of Canadian society by denying access to Canadian \nterritory to persons who are criminals or security risks.  \nExamples of personal circumstances the MD may consider, if they decide to exercise their \ndiscretion to do so:  \n• \nAge at time of landing—Has the person been a permanent resident of Canada since \nchildhood?  \n• \nWas the permanent resident an adult at the time of admission to Canada? \n• \nWas the person granted protected person status in Canada? \n• \nLength of residence—How long has the person resided in Canada after the date of \nadmission?  \n• \nLocation of family support and responsibilities—Are family members in Canada \nemotionally or financially dependent on the permanent resident? Are all extended family \nmembers in Canada?  \n• \nDegree of establishment—Is the permanent resident financially self-supporting? Are they \nemployed? Do they have a marketable trade or skill? Has the permanent resident made \nefforts to establish themselves in Canada through language training or skills upgrading? Is \nthere any evidence of community involvement? Has the permanent resident received social \nassistance (frequency/duration)? \n• \nCriminality—Has the permanent resident been convicted of any prior criminal offence? \nBased on reliable information, is the permanent resident involved in criminal or organized \ncrime activities? What is the nature and frequency of the person’s interactions with the law? \n(for further details please refer to ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports, section 10.1, ‘A44(1) reports \nfor criminality cases’). \n• \nWhat is the potential for rehabilitation? How much time has passed since the last \nconviction? Has the permanent resident already been released? For how long? Has the \npermanent resident accepted culpability, expressed remorse, enrolled in or completed \neducational, skills upgrading or rehabilitation programs (for example, Alcoholics \nAnonymous, Narconon/narcotics rehabilitation programs, anger management programs, life \nskills)? Are family members willing and able to support/assist?  \n• \nHistory of non-compliance and current attitude—Has the permanent resident been \ncooperative and forthcoming with information? Has a warning letter been previously issued? \nDoes the permanent resident accept responsibility for their actions? Are they remorseful? \n• \nBest interests of any children directly affected by the decision.  \n• \nRight of Appeal—Does the person have a right of appeal to the IAD under A63 if a \nremoval order is issued? (see section 20.1 of this chapter, ‘Appeals to the Immigration \nAppeal Division’). \nRegardless of the factors being considered, the MD should be aware that there are limitations to \nthe scope of their assessment. For example, the Federal Court has made findings to support the \nprinciple that officials carrying out A44(1) and (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate \nabout how and when future deportation might take place, nor is the expectation that a person’s \nrehabilitation be analyzed in considerable detail.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n47 \n2025-02-20 \n15.3 Loss of appeal right cases \nFor inadmissibility under A36(1)(a) for permanent residents, it is important for reporting officers \nto obtain the most accurate evidence of the sentence imposed during the A44(1) process in \norder to determine whether the person retains a right of appeal. Under A64, a loss of appeal \nrights for serious criminality under A36(1)(a) must be with respect to a crime that was punished \nin Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least six months.  Where it is not clear from the \nevidence whether the sentence meets the six month threshold under A64(2), before making any \nassessment under A44(1), the officer should obtain evidence demonstrating how the judge \ncalculated the total sentence imposed as reflected in the court documents, taking into account \nthe imposition of further credits for time served. Regardless of what assessment is made by the \nreporting officer, and especially in cases where the right of appeal is in doubt, the officer and/or \nthe MD should clearly articulate in the recommendation and/or decision that the determination \nas to whether the person concerned retains a right of appeal ultimately rests with the IAD. \n15.4 Preparation of warning letter \nWhere the MD finds that the A44(1) report is well-founded, but that there are other compelling \nreasons, taking into account the objectives of the IRPA, not to refer the A44(1) report to the ID \nfor an admissibility hearing, the MD may exercise their discretion to issue a warning letter. In \nsuch a case, the decision to issue a warning letter constitutes a disposition of the A44(2) \nproceedings on the existing A44(1) report.   \nBased on the limited scope of discretion of the MD, this option to the MD is intended only to be \navailable in cases of permanent residents and, in some circumstances, protected persons who \nremain foreign nationals. Such discretion should not be exercised lightly by the MD and must \ntake into account all of the circumstances of the case, the limited scope of discretion of the MD, \nthe objectives of the IRPA and Agency priorities regarding inadmissibility under A34, A35, \nA35.1, A36(1) and A37.   \nIn addition to the list of factors provided in section 15.2, in cases involving inadmissibility under \nA36(1), MDs should closely examine the nature of the criminal offence when reviewing the \nA44(1) report before issuing a warning letter. \nWhile balancing IRPA objectives regarding public safety and security, the MD may also \nconsider, in cases where the person is a protected person, whether the severity of the acts \ncommitted is such that the CBSA officer will be seeking a Danger Opinion under A115.    \nThe purpose of a warning letter is twofold: it conveys the decision and it is intended to act as a \ndeterrent. \nA warning letter sometimes has a third critical role: if, at some point in the future, the person \nbecomes reportable again (i.e., new circumstances of inadmissibility arise following the \nissuance of the warning letter), the record of the warning letter will be an important factor to \nconsider in an officer’s determination of whether to write a new A44(1) report and/or in the MD’s \ndecision to issue a removal order or refer the new report to the ID, should the person engage in \nfurther unlawful conduct. Officers also rely on the warning letter to demonstrate to the IAD that \nthe person concerned was duly cautioned as to the negative repercussions if another violation \noccurred.  \nIt should be noted, however, that following the issuance of a warning letter, any new A44(1) \nreport must be based on new facts/circumstances. In other words, a new report for the same \nallegation must not arise solely based on the same facts underlying the allegation of the \nprevious report on which the warning letter was issued and the MD cannot re-open the previous\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n48 \n2025-02-20 \nA44(2) proceedings. For example, if a permanent resident receives a warning letter based on an \nA44(1) report for A36(1)(a) (e.g., based on a robbery conviction), the permanent resident cannot \nbe re-reported under A44(1) for A36(1)(a) and/or referred for admissibility hearing based on the \nsame conviction should the permanent resident be subsequently convicted of a non-reportable \noffence (e.g., theft under).  \n \nThe warning letter should always be printed on letterhead. The fields should never be \nhandwritten. This cannot be a standard form letter, as it needs to be tailored to the individual \ncircumstances of the person concerned.  \n \nEvery effort should be made to hand-deliver the warning letter. The person concerned \nshould be asked to sign the file copy acknowledging receipt of the original. This is especially \nimportant in criminal cases in the event of a subsequent violation.  \n \nIf the letter cannot be hand-delivered because the person concerned is outside of the local \noffice’s jurisdiction, the letter should be forwarded to the responsible office with a request to \nhand-deliver the letter. If this is not feasible or practical, the letter should be sent by \nregistered mail. \n \nOnce the letter is completed and signed, it must be uploaded into GCMS and the MD  \ndisposition under the A44(2) examination process must be updated accordingly. The MD is \nalso required to enter detailed examination or application notes into GCMS fully supporting \nthe decision being made (see section 22, ‘Entering MD decisions into GCMS’). The \nissuance of the warning letter must also be recorded in the National Case Management \nSystem (NCMS) in offices where NCMS is utilized. \nFor an example of the warning letter, see Appendix B: Sample warning letter. \n \n \n16 Adjourning Proceedings \n \nCircumstances may warrant the adjournment of a proceeding under A44(2). In some cases, the \nMD may have to consider a request for an adjournment to ensure that a person has a \nreasonable opportunity to provide more evidence or to obtain counsel. \n \nThe MD may also have to adjourn proceedings based on operational reasons, such as the lack \nof an interpreter, however adjournments should not be a tool of administrative convenience. \n \nIn all cases, the MD will need to ensure that any decision regarding a request to adjourn is \nreasonable and meets the procedural fairness requirements set out in previous sections. \n \n \n17 Procedure: Entry for the purpose of further examination or an \nadmissibility hearing (Port of entry officers) \n \nUnder A23, an officer may authorize a person to enter Canada for the purpose of further \nexamination or an admissibility hearing. It is important to note that, pursuant to R43(2), a foreign \nnational authorized to enter Canada under A23 does not, by reason of that authorization, \nbecome a temporary resident or a permanent resident. The MD may have to initiate entry under \nA23 following an adjournment of the A44(2) proceeding or for operational reasons, such as the \nlack of an interpreter, however this procedure should not be used as a tool of administrative \nconvenience.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n49 \n2025-02-20 \nThe MD should not consider a request for entry under A23 to provide additional information \nunless all of the following conditions have been met: \n \n \nthere are strong indications that the person can easily produce additional documents \nrelevant to the inadmissibility report determination; \n \nthe MD believes the person’s indications to be credible; and \n \nthe person has not yet been given a reasonable chance to present additional \ndocuments. \nMDs should be cautious when considering entry for the purpose of an admissibility hearing \nsince the ID may not schedule an admissibility hearing for weeks or months, which could lead to \nthe foreign national remaining in Canada for a prolonged period without any legal status or a \nmeans of financial support. MDs may also consider other options such as directing persons \nback to the United States under R41 (see section 19, ‘Procedure: Directing persons back to the \nUnited States under R41’). \n \nNote:  Pursuant to R43(1) the imposition of certain prescribed conditions for persons authorized \nto enter Canada under A23 is mandatory.   \n \nThe MD should also keep in mind the provisions of A44(3), A55(3) and A56, which provide \nauthority to detain and release persons, and impose further conditions—including the payment \nof a deposit or the posting of a guarantee—following the furthering of an examination of a \nperson who is the subject of an A44(1) report. For further guidance see ENF 8 Deposits and \nGuarantees. For further details regarding detention and release authorities, see ENF 20 \nDetention and ENF 34 Alternatives to detention. \n \n \n18 Imposition of Conditions following the A44(1) report for A34:  \nMandatory circumstances \n \nA44(3) authorizes officers to impose any conditions, including the posting of a deposit or the \nposting of a guarantee for compliance with conditions, that the officer considers necessary, on a \npermanent resident or foreign national who is the subject of a subsection A44(1) report, an \nadmissibility hearing or, being in Canada, a removal order.   \n \nWhenever officers write an A44(1) report, consideration should be given to imposing conditions \non the foreign national or permanent resident. The MD also has the authority to impose \nconditions during the A44(2) process (e.g., following an adjournment of the proceedings or \nfollowing the decision to issue a removal order or refer the A44(1) report to the ID for an \nadmissibility hearing). Officers and MDs should always consult the D & D instruments regarding  \nthe authority to impose conditions as this authority may vary depending on whether the person \nconcerned is a foreign national or a permanent resident.  \n \nThe MD must be aware that in cases of inadmissibility on security grounds under A34, the \nimposition of conditions is mandatory once the report has been referred to the ID. Under the \nIRPA, decision-makers specified in the relevant legislative authority are required to impose the \nbaseline prescribed conditions in prescribed circumstances: CBSA officers are required in \nA44(4) and A56(3); ID is required in A58(5); Minister is required in A58.1(4) and A77.1(1); \nFederal Court is required in A82(6).\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n50 \n2025-02-20 \nThe prescribed conditions must be imposed in the following circumstances: \n \n \nwhen an inadmissibility report on grounds of security (A34) is referred to the ID and the \nsubject of the report is not detained (designated CBSA officers); \n \nwhen the subject of either an inadmissibility report on grounds of security (A34) that has \nbeen referred to the ID or a removal order for inadmissibility on grounds of security is \nreleased from detention; [designated CBSA officers under A56(3); ID under A58(5) and \nthe Minister under A58.1(4)]. \n \nFor each of the circumstances outlined above, the prescribed conditions to be imposed are \nfound in R250.1. \n \nSee Acknowledgement of Conditions for IRPA Section 34 Cases [BSF798]. \n \n \n19 Procedure:  Directing persons back to the United States under R41 \n \nR41 authorizes an officer to direct a foreign national seeking to enter Canada from the United \nStates (U.S.) to return to the U.S. if: \n \n \nno officer is able to complete an examination [R41(a)]; \n \nthe MD is not available to consider, under A44(2), a report made with respect to the \nperson [R41(b)];  \n \nan admissibility hearing cannot be held by the ID [R41(c)]; or \n \nthe foreign national is prohibited from entering Canada by an order or regulation made \nby the Governor in Council under the Emergencies Act or the Quarantine Act. \nIn such cases, the person concerned may be given a Direction to Return to the United States \nform (BSF505) in appropriate circumstances. Officers and MDs should be aware that there is a \nspecific policy for refugee claimants at the land port of entry. \n \nA person who has been directed to return to the U.S. pending an admissibility hearing by the ID \nand who seeks to come into Canada for reasons other than to appear at that hearing is \nconsidered to be seeking entry. If such a person remains inadmissible for the same reason(s), \nand if a member of the ID is not reasonably available, the person may be directed again to \nreturn to the U.S. to wait until a member of the ID is available. In these circumstances it is not \nnecessary to write a new A44(1) report. \n \nNote: Generally, persons directed back to the U.S. who choose not to return to Canada will not \nbe subject to enforcement action, as they have no desire to continue with their application to \nenter Canada. Such persons will simply be deemed to have withdrawn their application. Officers \nshould therefore not counsel the person that failure to return in these instances will \nautomatically result in enforcement action while the person is not in Canada. \n \nIn exceptional cases, it may be appropriate to pursue enforcement action for persons seeking \nentry who have failed to comply with R44(3). Officers and MDs should consider all information \nand individual circumstances of each case before they elect to proceed with enforcement action\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n51 \n2025-02-20 \nunder A44(1)/ A44(2), including the circumstances surrounding the failure to comply and the \nintent of the person concerned.  \n \nSee also: ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \n \n20 Appeals and Judicial Review— Removal Order \n \nThere are two levels of review of decisions made under the IRPA. Sponsors, permanent \nresident visa holders, permanent residents and protected persons have a statutory right to \nappeal adverse decisions to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and \nRefugee Board. In all other cases, where no statutory right of appeal exists under the IRPA or \nthose rights have been exhausted, there is a right to seek judicial review at the Federal Court of \nCanada. \n20.1 Appeals to the Immigration Appeal Division  \n \nThe MD will encounter three circumstances in which a person against whom they have made a \nremoval order may have a right of appeal to the IAD. Those circumstances involve a person \nwho is: \n \n \na foreign national who holds a permanent resident visa; \n \na permanent resident (inside or outside Canada); and \n \na protected person. \n \nWhere a person has a right to appeal, removal orders are stayed until the end of the appeal \nperiod expires (30 days) if no appeal is made and until the day of final determination of the \nappeal, if an appeal is made. Pursuant to A50(c), if the IAD grants a stay of removal, the  \nremoval order is stayed under A66(b) and A68 until the stay is no longer in force.  \n  \nTable 6:  Right to Appeal— Removal Order \n \nWho has right to \nappeal \nLegislation \nPeriod in which \nappeal must be \nmade \nWho is excluded \nForeign national \nholding a permanent \nresident visa  \nA63(2)* \n30 days after \nreceiving the \ndecision \n \n \nA64(1), A64)(2) \nPermanent resident \n(in Canada) \nA63(3)* \n30 days after \nreceiving the \ndecision \n \n \nA64(1), A64(2) \nPermanent resident \n(outside Canada) \nA63(4) \n60 days to appeal \n \n \nProtected person \n \nA63(3)* \n30 days after \nreceiving the \ndecision \n \nA64(1)\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n52 \n2025-02-20 \n*A64(1)— No Right to Appeal  \n \nNo appeal may be made to the IAD by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a permanent \nresident or protected person if they have been found to be inadmissible on grounds of: \n \n \nsecurity, violating human or international rights (A34)  \n \nviolating human or international rights (A35)   \n \nsanctions (A35.1) \n \nserious criminality (A36)**  \n \norganized criminality (A37)  \n \n**must be with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by        \n             a term of imprisonment of at least six months or that is described in paragraph 36(1)(b)  \n             or (c) \n \nWhen the MD makes a removal order against a person who may have a right to appeal that \ndecision to the IAD, officers must advise the persons of that right. This is easily accomplished \nby giving them a notification of appeal form and informing them of their right to appeal. \n \nThe MD is also to provide the persons with the address and telephone number of the IAD \nregistry office so that the persons may file a notice of appeal with the Registrar if they so \nchoose. \n \nThe MD should also obtain a written acknowledgement from the persons that they have been \nadvised of their right to appeal to the IAD and place it in the case file. \n \nSee Appendix G:  Sample letter—  IAD Appeal Acknowledgement Letter \n20.2 Right to file an application for leave and judicial review— Where no statutory \nright of appeal exists \n \nWhen an MD makes a removal order against a person who does not have the right to appeal to \nthe IAD, the MD is to advise the person of their right to file an application for leave and judicial \nreview with the Federal Court pursuant to A72(1). \n \nFor example, foreign nationals who are not protected persons or who do not hold a permanent \nresident visa have no statutory right of appeal to the IAD against a removal order issued by the \nMD. However, they may challenge a removal order made by the MD at the Federal Court. \n \nIf a statutory appeal, as may be provided for by the IRPA, has not been resolved, neither the \nMinister nor the person concerned may appeal to the Federal Court.  \n \nThe MD should obtain a written acknowledgment from the persons concerned, stating that they \nhave been advised of their right to file an application for leave and judicial review, and place it in \nthe case file. Applications for leave and judicial review must be filed within 15 days of the date of \nthe removal order. \n \nSee Appendix H:  Sample letter—  Judicial Review Acknowledgement Letter\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n53 \n2025-02-20 \nFor further information regarding Judicial reviews, see ENF 9 Judicial Reviews and ENF 10 \nRemovals.  \n \n \n21 Multiple allegations  \n \nWhere the person is inadmissible under multiple provisions of the IRPA, it is generally \nrecommended that the officer writes a separate report for each allegation. The MD will then \nmake a determination on each report during the A44(2) process.  \n \nThere may be instances where multiple allegations are contained within the same report. This \npractice is generally discouraged, especially where the jurisdiction for each inadmissibility does \nnot lie with the same decision-maker (i.e., MD or ID). It should be noted, however, that where a \nreport contains one or more inadmissibility allegation, and if the MD has jurisdiction for all \ninadmissibility allegations contained within that report, the MD can determine the disposition of \nthat report; conversely, where there are several inadmissibility allegations in a report and the \nMD has jurisdiction for only some of them, the MD is not authorized to determine a disposition \nfor that report, and all allegations must be referred to the ID. \n \nIn cases where multiple A44(1) reports have been prepared against an individual concurrently \nand the MD is of the opinion that each of the inadmissibility allegations is well-founded, the MD \nshould consider the potential consequences of not referring all reports for an admissibility \nhearing (where the jurisdiction to the issue the removal order rests with the ID) at the same \ntime, including the following: \n \nin cases where multiple reports have been written for A36(1)(a) serious criminality based \non separate convictions in Canada, the fact that having a separate removal order on \neach report may be critical in ensuring that IRPA objectives are met in the event that one \nor more of the underlining convictions and/or sentences are later overturned on appeal \nby the criminal courts; \n \nabuse of process arguments may be raised at a later time if all A44(1) reports before the \nMD are not referred for an admissibility hearing at the same time.   \n \n \n22 Entering MD decisions into GCMS \n \nWhen processing or issuing an immigration document, completing an MD review, or conducting \nan examination, the MD is required to enter detailed examination or application notes into \nGCMS fully supporting the decision being made, regardless of whether the decision was \npositive or negative. \n \n \nNotes are to be factual and should not contain personal opinions which are not \nsupported by elements collected during the examination or review. The notes may \nconsist of such items as: questions and answers asked during the examination or \nreview, admissibility concerns the officer or MD may have, a synopsis of any \ndocumentation reviewed or requested, and any other pertinent details related to the \nexamination/application or MD review. The notes are to include the decision made and \nrationale supporting the decision. Notes should provide sufficient detail to allow another \nGCMS user to understand what transpired and why an action was taken. Notes entered\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n54 \n2025-02-20 \non the Client screen should be general information on the client, and should not be used \nfor Examination/Application Notes. \n \nOfficers are to continue to record user remarks on facilitation documents and narratives \nin the inadmissibility sub-tab supporting the inadmissibility allegations. \n \nMDs should be uploading examination notes that clearly show that procedural fairness \nhas been met, and what factors were considered as part of the decision. \n \nIt is important to note that A44(2) decision notes in GCMS are also reviewed by officials \nprocessing applications, and therefore may directly impact future decisions (e.g. \napplications for TRPs, temporary residence or permanent residence).  \n \nCBSA officers may consult the GCMS Help Centre for additional information on how to enter \nnotes and upload documents into GCMS. \n \n \n \n23 Key aspects of assessing inadmissibility under A36 \n \n23.1 Criminal equivalency between foreign and Canadian jurisdictions \n \nAs part of the inadmissibility determination for A36(1)(b) or (c) and A36(2)(b) or (c) as well as \nconsiderations related to criminal rehabilitation under the IRPA, it is necessary for the MD to \ndetermine if a conviction or offence committed outside of Canada has an equivalent in Canadian \nlaw. This means that in A44(2) proceedings, all necessary evidence for determining criminal \nequivalency will also need to accompany the A44(1) report.   \nIn other words, the MD must have the evidence required to determine whether the acts \ncommitted abroad and punished there would be punishable in Canada. This analysis is a \nnecessary part of the MD’s decision in order to refer the report to the ID for an admissibility \nhearing, even though the MD does not have jurisdiction to issue the removal order. \nIt is important to note that A36(1)(b) or (c) and A36(2)(b) or (c) cannot be used where the \nperson has been acquitted or a court has made a finding of not guilty. \nFor further details, see ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility and ENF 3 Admissibility Hearings and \nDetention Reviews. \n23.2 Record suspensions for convictions in Canada \n \nMDs must also be careful not to rely on convictions for which a record suspension has been \ngranted as evidence of a criminal record. \n \nIn the case of convictions in Canada, the Parole Board of Canada has the authority to grant and \nissue record suspensions (formerly known as “pardons”) to persons described in A36(1)(a), and \nA36(2)(a), who have been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament. \n \nRecord suspension for in-Canada offences is the responsibility of the Parole Board of Canada, \nso neither deemed rehabilitation nor rehabilitation can be granted for such offences. \n \nFor more information about record suspensions, see ENF2, Evaluating inadmissibility.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n55 \n2025-02-20 \n23.3 Criminal Rehabilitation \n \nPursuant to A36(3)(c), in prescribed circumstances, an inadmissibility under A36(2)(b) or (c) \nmay be overcome through rehabilitation.  \n \nThere are two types of Rehabilitation: Deemed Rehabilitation and Individual Rehabilitation. The \neffect of both is that they remove specific grounds of inadmissibility if certain conditions exist or \nprescribed requirements are met. \n \nUnder the D&D instruments, only certain MDs have been delegated to assess and render a \ndecision on applications for individual rehabilitation. \n \nFor further guidance on criminal rehabilitation, see ENF2 Evaluating inadmissibility. \n23.4 Offences under the Youth Criminal Justice Act \n \nA36(3)(e) exempts permanent residents and foreign nationals found guilty under the Young \nOffenders Act (YOA) or the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) from the inadmissibility \nprovisions in A36(1) and A36(2). \n \nCanadian legislation (YOA and YCJA) defines a young offender/young person as someone who \nis at least 12, but under 18 years of age. A child under the age of 12, cannot be charged with an \noffence under the Criminal Code of Canada and a person 18 years old and over would be \ncharged as an adult. \n \nThe MD must ensure that they do not rely on or refer to youth offences in any determinations \nunder A44(2), except where access is authorized under the YCJA.  Information that is not \naccessible under the provisions of the YCJA cannot be considered and must not be included or \nreferenced at any point during A44(1) or (2) proceedings. Moreover, contravention of the \nprovisions of the YCJA is a serious matter. \n \nThe importance of verifying whether information is protected by YCJA provisions was \nhighlighted in Abdi v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 2017 FC 950. In \nthat case, the Federal Court held that while the MD did not commit an error in relying on youth \ncrimes that the applicant was found guilty of where access to these records was not restricted \nby virtue of section 119(9) of the YCJA, the MD’s reliance on youth offences that were \nwithdrawn or dismissed was unreasonable since section 119(2)(c) of the YCJA allows access to \nthese records for only a brief period after dismissal or withdrawal of the youth charges and the \naccess period to such charges had expired. \n \nOfficials conducting A44(1) and A44(2) functions must ensure that they only rely on youth \nrecords to which access is not restricted under the provisions of the YCJA.  It is therefore \nimportant for reporting officers and the MD to be aware of the provisions of the YCJA which \nrelate to access to youth records.\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n56

Enclosed, you will find a \nreport written under subsection 44(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. \n \nPermanent residents of Canada may be reported to the Minister when they have engaged in criminal \nactivity of a serious nature. Your conviction for xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is reportable under paragraph \n36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. \n \nThis report is now a permanent part of your immigration record.  The circumstances of your case have \nbeen considered carefully and it has been decided that your case will not be referred to the Immigration \nDivision for an admissibility hearing at this time. \n \nYou must understand however, that this decision may be reviewed in the future should new adverse \ninformation come to our attention or any further criminal convictions be registered against you. If such a \nreview occurs, a decision to pursue enforcement action may result in referring you to the Immigration \nDivision of the Immigration and Refugee Board for an admissibility hearing.  The outcome of this hearing \ncould result in a deportation order and your permanent removal from Canada. \n \nWe trust that you understand the gravity of this matter and that we will not be required to contact you \nagain as the result of any further criminal activity. \n \n \nYours truly, \n \n \n \n(signature) \n \nName of Minister’s Delegate and title \n \n \n \n \nNote: This is a sample letter with suggested wording.

Advise the person that they      \n            should advise MD at any time if they do not understand the interpreter. \n \nIf necessary, adjourn proceedings to obtain interpreter. \n \n \n \nStep 4  Confirm person concerned has a copy of the report and the evidence being used to   \n             support the allegation and has had the opportunity to review it.  \n \nRead the allegations contained in the A44(1) to the person concerned. \n \nState the purpose of the proceedings and refer to the A44(1) report. \n \nAdvise the person that they must answer questions completely and truthfully. \n \nStep 5  Explain the process MD will be following, evidence to be considered and the  \n             consequences of finding the report well-founded. Ensure the person concerned    \n             understands that this process may result in a removal order being issued, the type of     \n             removal order, and the consequence of this order. \n \nStep 6  In detained cases:  Prior to commencing the proceeding, advise the person concerned  \n            of their right to have a counsel of their choosing present at their own expense. This right  \n            applies in all cases where a person is detained under an Act of Parliament and includes  \n            situations where the person is detained by the criminal courts while facing charges or  \n            serving a sentence and subject to IRPA proceedings. Should the person express an  \n            intention to communicate with counsel, the MD should adjourn the proceeding and allow  \n            a reasonable period of time for the person to retain counsel. \n \nIn released cases:  The person does not have the right to have counsel present during \nthe MD review, however the MD should consider permitting counsel’s attendance should\nENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n61 \n2025-02-20 \nthe person concerned have a counsel present, as long as counsel’s presence will not \ninterfere with the process. MDs are not obligated to postpone MD review proceedings \ndue to counsel unavailability, however, may consider such requests on case-by-case \nbasis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStep 7  Verify each of the case elements of the allegation contained in the A44(1) report  \n \n by questioning the person to confirm that each of these elements has been proven     \n             by the evidence, either verbally or in writing.   \n \n Verify person concerned has no other evidence/information to provide and if so,  \ndetermine whether an adjournment is warranted.  \n \nAllow the person the opportunity to respond and acknowledge their evidence and \ndocument this either by notes or making copies of what is presented, particularly if there \nis any inconsistency between the allegation in the A44(1) report and the person's \ndeclaration. MD must ensure that all the evidence presented has been considered. \n \nStep 8  The MD should ask the person how long they intend to remain in Canada and follow  \n             the steps in ENF 6, section 13, ‘Procedure: Handling possible claims for refugee  \n             protection’. \n \nWhere the person does not express a fear of returning to their country or indicate an \nintention to make a claim, the MD should proceed with the decision and issue a removal \norder, if appropriate. \n \nWhere the person’s statements indicate a fear of returning to the country that may relate \nto refugee protection, the MD is to inform the person of the definition of a “Convention \nrefugee” or “person in need of protection” as found in A96 and A97, and ask whether \nthey wish to make a claim before proceeding with the issuance of a removal order. \n \nStep 9   Advise the person of the decision and the reasons for the decision.  \n \n \nStep 10   If issuing a removal order, provide the person concerned with a copy of the removal  \n                order and  its legal effect.   \n \nWhere applicable, explain the Certificate of Departure process and that a Departure \nOrder will turn into a Deportation Order should they fail to properly follow the process for \nverifying departure (for further information, see ENF 10 Removals). \n \nAdvise person concerned of their right to appeal (as applicable) or right to seek judicial \nreview and the relevant time limits and document this. Provide relevant appeal forms \nand have the person sign the relevant acknowledgement letter, where appropriate. For \nfurther information, see ENF 6, section 20 ‘Appeals and Judicial Review- Removal \nOrder’. \n   \nStep 11  At the conclusion of the review, notate the time and sign the record of decision, \n               including the completion of the MD portion of forms [e.g., BSF516, IMM5084 or  \n               A44(1) narrative report].
