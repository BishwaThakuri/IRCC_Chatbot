Appendix C, where these instructions were formerly found, has been \nremoved. It is to be noted in particular that with the closing of the Winnipeg office, \nindividuals who reside in Manitoba or in Saskatchewan should in future communicate \nwith the Registry Office in Vancouver. \n \nThe “Notice of Appeal – Residency Obligation Appeal, subsection 63(4) of \nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act has also been updated to reflect additional \ninformation contained in the paragraph relevant to those individuals who wish to return \nto Canada to appear in person at their hearing. It specifies that the IAD will decide on \nthe application based on whether it is necessary for the person to be present at their \nhearing. \n2005-09-22 \nOP 10 has been revised to show the change to the level of delegation overseas \nfor A28 (residency determination) which previously rested solely with the Immigration \nProgram Manager. This authority may now be exercised by Deputy Program Managers. \nDeputy Program Manager means those positions formally designated as Deputy Program \nManager or Operations Manager by International Region/Personnel. This supersedes the \nmessage below of 2003-07-22 which addresses the role of the Immigration Program Manager. \nThe beginning of section 5 has been amended to add clarifications to authorities. \nSection 5.2 has been updated to add clarification concerning applicants providing a contact \naddress in Canada in the event that further information or a personal interview is required in \nconnection to the PR card application. \nSection 5.3 has been updated to reflect the coming into force of R259(a) and R259(e). \nIn section 16, there is further instruction when a client does not provide additional \ninformation to enable an officer to render a decision on residency determination. \nIn section 16.2, it is now specified that the CBSA hearings office will request the overseas file \nwhen an appeal has been filed. \nAppendix A and Appendix B have been amended slightly to clarify the letters to applicants \nconcerning appeal rights. Some paragraphs that addressed transitional measures have been \ndeleted. \n2005-01-19 \nAppendix B has been updated to clarify the notification to permanent residents regarding their \nright to appeal a negative residency determination. \nThe document titled “Important Instructions for Residency Obligation Appeal” has been added \nas Appendix C. \n2004-05-12\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n6 \nSection 16.3 has been added to reflect the procedures regarding” Permanent Resident Status \nDetermination and Issuance of Permanent Resident Travel Documents.” \n2004-05-12 \nSection 16.3 has been added to reflect the procedures regarding ” Permanent Resident Status \nDetermination and Issuance of Permanent Resident Travel Documents.” \n2004-05-12 \nSection 16.3 has been added to reflect the procedures regarding ”Permanent Resident Status \nDetermination and Issuance of Permanent Resident Travel Documents.” \n2003-09-03 \nThe Internet address concerning the Important Instructions for Residency Obligation Appeal \nmentioned in Appendix C has been amended. \n2003-07-22 \nA revision of OP 10 (Permanent Residency Status Determination) has been done to clarify the \nrole of the Immigration Program Manager in the process of determination of permanent \nresidency status as follows: \n \nSection 14 and Section 16 — The role of the Program Manager in reviewing all H & C \nconsiderations apparent in an application is clarified and notes that all negative decisions \non PR status determination can be made only by the Program Manager and that the \nrefusal letter can be signed only by them. \n \nThe refusal letter sample, at Appendix A, has been modified to reflect the above-noted \nclarifications. \n \nSection 16.1 expands the guidelines in regard to the best interests of the child. \n \nSection 16.2 was created to clearly outline the appeal rights of permanent residents. It \nindicates that a refusal letter with related instructions and a Notice of Appeal form must \naccompany all PR status determination refusals. \n2002-12-17 \nLoss of Residency Status Procedures amended. \n \nSee ENF 23, Section 5 and Section 7.6 as well as Appendix C. \n \nSee OP 10, Section 5.1 and Section 13 as well as Appendix D. \n \nForms IMM 5539B and IMM 5538B are available electronically.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n7 \n1 What this chapter is about \nThis manual chapter explains: \n \nwho may apply for a status document; \n \nwhen and why determinations of residency status are required; \n \nwhat to take into consideration when making a determination of residency status; \n \nwhat to do if an applicant has been deemed to have fulfilled the residency obligation and \nmaintained residency status; \n \nwhat to do if an applicant has been deemed to have lost residency status; \n \nwhat to do if an applicant wishes to relinquish their permanent resident status; and \n \nwhen to issue a travel document for permanent residents to a person who has undergone \na residency status determination. \n2 Program objectives \nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) establishes residency requirements and \nobligations with respect to each five-year period after the granting of permanent residency \nstatus. The intent of the Regulations governing the residency obligations of permanent \nresidents is: \n \nto prescribe flexible, clear and objective rules and criteria for establishing and \ndetermining compliance with the residency obligation provisions of IRPA; \n \nto assist decision makers in assessing factors related to determinations of residency \nstatus as well as to enhance transparency and consistency in decision making; and \n \nto prescribe rules for calculating days of physical presence in Canada for the purpose of \ndetermining compliance with the residency obligation under A28. \n3 The Act and Regulations \nFor legislation regarding the residency obligations of permanent residents, the permanent \nresident card and the travel document for permanent residents, please refer to: \nRight of permanent residents \nA27(1) \nConditions pertaining to permanent residents \nA27(2) \nResidency obligation \nA28(1)\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n8 \nProvisions governing residency obligation \nA28(2) \nStatus document \nA31(1) \nEffect of status document \nA31(2) \nTravel document \nA31(3) \nRegulations relating to application of A27 to A31 \nA32 \nLoss of permanent resident status \nA46 \nRight of appeal – Residency obligation \nA63(4) \nTransportation companies – Obligation of operators of vehicles and \nfacilities \nA148(1) \nPresence of permanent resident at appeal hearing \nA175(2) \nExclusion under Transitional Provisions \nA200 \nDocuments – Permanent residents \nR50(1) \nDocument indicating status – Permanent resident card \nR53 \nPeriod of validity – Permanent resident card \nR54 \nDelivery – Permanent resident card \nR55\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n9 \nIssuance of new permanent resident card \nR59 \nRevocation – Permanent resident card \nR60 \nResidency obligation –- Canadian business \nR61(1) \nExclusion – Canadian business \nR61(2) \nEmployment outside Canada \nR61(3) \nAccompanying outside Canada \nR61(4) \nCompliance with residency obligation \nR61(5) \nChild – Definition \nR61(6) \nCalculation – Residency obligation \nR62(1) \nException \nR62(2) \nPrescribed documents – Transportation \nR259 \nTransitional Provisions – Permanent residents \nR328(1) \nTransitional Provisions – Returning resident permit \nR328(2) and R328(3) \n3.1 Forms \nThe forms required are shown in the following table.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n10 \nForm title \nForm \nnumber \nImmigrant Visa and Record of Landing \nIMM 1000B \nGeneric Document - Confirmation of Permanent Residence \nIMM 5292B \nApplication for a Travel Document (Permanent Resident Abroad) \nIMM 5524E \nDeclaration - Voluntary Relinquishment of Permanent Resident Status / \nResidency Obligation Not Met \nIMM 5538B \nDeclaration - Relinquishment of Permanent Resident Status / Residency \nObligation Met \nIMM 5539B \nConfiscated or Voluntary Surrendered IMM 1000B \nIMM 1342B \n4 Instruments and delegations \nPursuant to A6(1) and A6(2), the Minister has designated persons or class of persons as \nofficers to carry out any purpose of any provision, legislative or regulatory, and has specified \nthe powers and duties of the officers so designated. The delegations with respect to this \nchapter can be found as follows: \nIL 3, Annex F, Module 8, Column 1, Item No. 48. \nIL 3, Annex F, Module 8, Column 1, Item No. 52. \nIL 3, Annex F, Module 9, Column 1, Item No. 67. \n5 Departmental policy \nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is responsible for the administration of \nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). \nThe Minister of Public Safety Canada is responsible for the administration of IRPA as it relates \nto:\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n11 \n \nexamination at ports of entry; \n \nthe enforcement of IRPA, including arrest, detention and removal; \n \nthe establishment of policies respecting the enforcement of IRPA and inadmissibility on \ngrounds of security, organized criminality or violating human or international rights; or \n \ndeterminations under any of A34(2) , A35(2) and A37(2). \nThe permanent resident status determination is a CIC policy responsibility. \n5.1 Legislative basis – Residency obligation \nIRPA establishes residency requirements and obligations with respect to each five-year period \nafter the granting of permanent residency status. The provisions governing the residency \nobligation under the Act and Regulations are based primarily on the requirement of “physical \npresence” or on prescribed linkages to Canadian institutions outside Canada. These provisions \nare substantially different from those contained in the former Immigration Act, where \nretaining residency was largely dependent on a satisfactory demonstration of a person’s \n“intent” not to abandon Canada as their place of permanent residence. \nPursuant to A28(2), a permanent resident complies with the residency obligation provisions \nwith respect to a five-year period if, for at least 730 days in that five-year period, the \npermanent resident is physically present in Canada, or: \n \nis outside Canada accompanying a Canadian citizen who is their spouse or common-law \npartner or is a child accompanying a parent; \n \nis outside Canada employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or in the public \nservice of Canada or of a province; \n \nis an accompanying spouse, common-law partner or child of a permanent resident who is \noutside Canada and is employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or in the \npublic service of Canada or of a province. \nIn determining whether a permanent resident meets the residency test of physical presence \nfor at least 730 days in a five-year period, A28(2)(b)(i) and (ii) state that: \n28.(2)(b) it is sufficient for a permanent resident to demonstrate at examination \n(i) if they have been a permanent resident for less than five years, that they will be able to \nmeet the residency obligation in respect of the five-year period immediately after they \nbecame a permanent resident; \n(ii) if they have been a permanent resident for five years or more, that they have met the \nresidency obligation in respect of the five-year period immediately before the examination [of \ntheir residency status by a visa officer]. \nFor the purposes of determining the date of the examination of residency status, a visa officer \nshall use the date that an application is officially received in the visa office. By stipulating that \nthe examination of residency status begins on the day that the application is received in the\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n12 \nvisa office, the applicant is not disadvantaged in any way if the formal assessment of an \napplication is delayed for any period of time following receipt of the application. \nFor persons who have been permanent residents of Canada for more than five years, the only \nfive-year period that can be considered in calculating whether an applicant has met the \nresidency obligation is the one immediately before the application is received in the visa \noffice. A28(2)(b)(ii) precludes a visa officer from examining any period other than the most \nrecent five-year period immediately before the date of receipt of the application. \nEven if a person had resided away from Canada for many years, but returned to Canada and \nresided there for a minimum of 730 days during the last five years, that person would comply \nwith the residency obligation and remain a permanent resident. An officer is not permitted to \nconsider just any five-year period in the applicant’s past, but must always assess the most \nrecent five-year period preceding the receipt of the application. \nPersons who became permanent residents of Canada less than five years prior to the date of \nreceipt of the application are governed by A28(2)(b)(i). This subsection of the Act allows new \npermanent residents to qualify under the residency obligation provided that they can \npotentially meet the 730-day criteria during the first five-year period immediately after their \narrival in Canada. Even if a person resides away from Canada for up to three years following \nthe date of first arrival in Canada, that person will retain permanent resident status as long as \nthey still have the possibility of complying with the 730-days-in-Canada rule. \nAn officer is not permitted to exclude the possibility that an applicant who has resided abroad \nfor three years may still be able to comply with the residency obligation during the remaining \ntwo years of the five-year period. \nThe Regulations pertaining to the residency obligation provide definitions and further describe \nsituations, in addition to those outlined in A28, in which time spent away from Canada can be \ndeemed to be time in Canada for the purpose of retaining permanent resident status [R61]. \nThe Regulations allow permanent residents a significant degree of flexibility to engage in a \nwide range of long-term employment opportunities abroad provided that they maintain ties to \nCanada by means of a continuing connection to the Canadian public service or a business in \nCanada. The Regulations also specify circumstances in which close family members who are \npermanent residents can maintain their status while accompanying a Canadian citizen abroad, \nor a permanent resident employed abroad [R61(4)]. \nUnder the former Immigration Act, it was practice to allow persons to voluntarily relinquish \npermanent resident status when they declared they had ceased to be a permanent resident in \naccordance with the criteria in A24 of IRPA (they had remained outside of Canada with the \nintention of abandoning Canada as their place of permanent residence). \nUnlike the Immigration Act, the criteria in IRPA for loss of status require that an officer \nconduct a determination of the residency obligation under A28 before loss of status can occur. \nOutside of Canada, the loss of status occurs when the appeal period of 60 days expires, in the \ncase of a person who does not challenge a negative residency obligation determination \n[A46(1)(b)].\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n13 \nAt ports of entry or inland, loss of status occurs when the period of 30 days to file an appeal \nagainst the removal order expires and the order comes into force [A46(1)(c), A49(1)(c)]. In \naddition, the Department has decided to allow voluntary relinquishment of permanent \nresident status in limited circumstances. \nPersons are no longer permanent residents for all purposes under IRPA once a determination \nis made that they have lost permanent resident status due to previous relinquishment \n(signing an IMM 1342B under the former Act), voluntary relinquishment under IRPA, a \ndetermination under A28 and expiry of the appeal period, or a waiver of appeal rights \nfollowing a negative determination under A28 made abroad. \n5.2 The permanent resident card as a status document \nA31(1) provides for permanent residents of Canada, as a matter of right, to be issued a \ndocument indicating their status. The Regulations further define the term “status document” \nby designating the permanent resident card as the document issued to permanent residents \nto indicate their status underR53(1). After June 28, 2002, a status document in the form of a \nnew permanent resident card began to be issued to permanent residents in Canada, in \ncompliance with R53(1)(a). The permanent resident card provides holders with a convenient \ndocument that facilitates their return to and entry into Canada. \nThe requirement in A31(1) to provide permanent residents and protected persons with a \ndocument indicating their status is new in law, as is the presumption that a person in \npossession of such a document is a permanent resident unless an officer determines \notherwise. Also new is the presumption that a person outside Canada who is not in possession \nof a permanent resident document is not a permanent resident [A31(2)(b)]. For many years, \nthe Department provided permanent residents with proof of landing in the form of an \nImmigrant Visa and Record of Landing (IMM 1000B). Legally, the IMM 1000B served only as \nevidence of the fact of landing, as possession of a record of landing was not regarded as \npresumptive proof of status. The IMM 1000B was issued as a matter of administrative \nprocedure and did not require its own regulations. \nFor the first time, Canada is issuing a secure status document in the form of a permanent \nresident card, which is valid for up to five years. The Regulations governing the permanent \nresident card establish that persons who became permanent residents under IRPA will be \nprovided with the card after their entry into Canada. Permanent residents who obtained that \nstatus prior to the entry into force of IRPA may apply for a permanent resident card. To \nqualify for the permanent resident card, applicants must meet the residency obligation \noutlined in A28 . \nThe permanent resident card is not issued to permanent residents who apply for it outside \nCanada [R55]. Rather, permanent residents must submit their applications for a permanent \nresident card in Canada. However, nothing prevents a permanent resident residing abroad \nfrom travelling to Canada to submit an application and providing a contact address in Canada \nwhere they can be reached in the event that further information or a personal interview is \nrequired. To be provided with their PR card, applicants must attend at the time and place\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n14 \nspecified in a notice within 180 days of receiving notification that the card is available \n[R58(3)]. \n5.3 The travel document and determination of residency status \nThere is no provision within IRPA for an applicant to apply directly for a formal determination \nof residency status. An applicant seeking a determination of status must first submit an \nApplication for a Travel Document (Permanent Resident Abroad) (IMM 5524E). Processing \napplicants for a travel document involves a series of steps, including an assessment against \neach of the residency obligation provisions of A28. If an applicant meets any of the provisions \nof the residency obligation, a travel document is issued, both to enable travel to Canada as \nwell as to confirm status as a permanent resident. There are also circumstances in which an \nofficer is obliged to issue this travel document even if the applicant does not meet the \nresidency obligation criteria of A31(3). The various elements of the process are discussed in \ngreater detail in section 12, section 14 and section 15 below. \nPersons who received their permanent resident status before June 28, 2002, do not have a \nright to the status document mentioned in A31(1), as A200 makes void the operation of \nA31(1) in this instance. They cannot show up at a visa office and demand a permanent \nresident card. Nor can they demand to be issued a travel document for permanent residents, \nas they must first demonstrate that they are in compliance with the residency obligation \nbefore receiving the travel document. Since the coming into force of R259(a) and R259(e) in \nDecember 2003, a PR card or PRTD is required for return travel to Canada by a commercial \ncarrier. \n5.4 What is meant by humanitarian and compassionate grounds? \nA28(2)(c) specifically requires consideration of humanitarian and compassionate factors \nbefore a determination can be made that a person has lost their permanent resident status. \nOnly an Immigration Program Manager, Deputy Program Manager, or Operations Manager is \ndelegated to make a determination of loss of status and to refuse an application. A Manager \nor an immigration officer (but not a designated immigration officer) may make a \ndetermination that humanitarian and compassionate considerations justify the retention of \npermanent resident status and therefore approve an application on humanitarian and \ncompassionate grounds. \nDesignated immigration officers can still assess humanitarian and compassionate factors on \nPRTD applications and make recommendations, but pursuant to the Designation and \nDelegation Instruments, cannot make a determination on humanitarian and compassionate \nfactors. If a positive determination on humanitarian and compassionate factors has been \nmade by a manager or an immigration officer, a designated immigration officer can complete \nthe processing of the application and issue the PRTD.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n15 \nIn evaluating humanitarian and compassionate factors, the manager or immigration officer \nmust take into account the best interests of the children directly affected by any \ndetermination of their residency status or that of their parents. \nA28(2)(c) provides a wide degree of flexibility to the manager or immigration officer to \ndetermine whether permanent residents meet the residency obligation, even under \ncircumstances that are not specifically outlined in the situations referred to \nin A28(2)(a) or R61. Humanitarian and compassionate grounds are taken into account in \nmany other types of immigration cases where there is a need to provide an exceptional \nresponse to a particular set of circumstances. Humanitarian and compassionate \nconsiderations are present in many of the situations involved in a prolonged absence from \nCanada. Assessing them normally includes an examination of supporting evidence presented \nby a permanent resident concerning events and circumstances that have occurred in the five-\nyear period immediately preceding an examination. While \"intent\" is no longer the \ndeterminative factor that it was under the former Immigration Act, the applicant's intent will \nbe taken into consideration as an element of the humanitarian and compassionate \nassessment. \nPermanent residents bear the onus of satisfying the manager  or immigration officer that \nthere are compelling humanitarian and compassionate factors in their individual \ncircumstances that justify retention of permanent resident status. They also bear the onus of \nexplaining why they were not able to comply with the residency obligation. It is their \nresponsibility to describe the hardship that a loss of residency status may cause to them or to \nfamily members, who would be directly affected by the decision. The hardship resulting from \na decision that an individual or a family has lost permanent resident status may be unusual \nand undeserved, or disproportionate (see definitions of hardship, section 6.6 and section \n6.7 below). \nManagers and immigration officers should not limit the exercise of their discretion only to \ncases of unusual and undeserved hardship. They should consider approving cases on \nhumanitarian and compassionate grounds wherever the hardship of losing residency status \nwould have a disproportionate impact on the permanent residents or on their family \nmembers, taking into account personal circumstances. \n6 Definitions \n6.1 Accompanying outside of Canada \nA28(2)(a) (ii) and (iv) provide that each day a permanent resident is outside of Canada \naccompanying a Canadian citizen spouse, common-law partner or, in the case of a child, a \nparent with whom they ordinarily reside, it is deemed a day of physical presence in Canada. \nEach day a permanent resident is outside Canada, accompanying a spouse, common-law \npartner or, in the case of a child, a parent who is also a permanent resident and with whom \nthey ordinarily reside, is also deemed a day of physical presence in Canada provided the\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n16 \nspouse, common-law partner or parent of the other permanent resident is employed on a full-\ntime basis by a Canadian business or in the public service of Canada or of a province. \n6.2 Canadian business \nThe definition applies to both large and small businesses and includes: \n \nfederally or provincially incorporated businesses that have an ongoing operation in \nCanada; \n \nother enterprises that have an ongoing operation in Canada, are capable of generating \nrevenue, are carried out in anticipation of profit and in which a majority of voting or \nownership interests is held by Canadian citizens, permanent residents or Canadian \nbusinesses; and \n \nenterprises which have been created by the laws of Canada or a province. \nNote: It does not include businesses that have been created primarily for the purpose of allowing \na permanent resident to satisfy their residency obligation while residing outside of Canada \n[R61(2)]. \n6.3 Child \nFor the purposes of A28(2)(a)(ii) and (iv), a \"child\" is defined as a child of a Canadian citizen \nor permanent resident, including an adopted child, who is not and has never been a spouse or \ncommon-law partner and is less than 22 years of age. \n6.4 Day \nSection 27(2) of the Interpretation Act governs the calculation of time limits in federal \nstatutes. Where a statute refers to a number of days between two events (and precedes the \nnumber of days with the words “at least”), both the day of occurrence of the first event as \nwell as the day of occurrence of the second event are to be counted in calculating the number \nof days. For the purpose of calculating the number of days to comply with the residency \nobligation in IRPA A28(2)(a), a day includes a full day or any part of a day that a permanent \nresident is physically present in Canada. Any part of a day spent in Canada, or otherwise in \ncompliance with A28(2)(a), is to be counted as one full day for the purpose of calculating the \n730 days in a five-year period. \n6.5 Employment outside of Canada \nThe Regulations enable permanent residents to comply with the residency obligations while \nworking abroad, provided that:\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n17 \n \nthey are under contract to or are full-time employees of a Canadian business or in the \npublic service, where the assignment is controlled from the head office of a Canadian \nbusiness or public institution in Canada; \n \nthey are assigned on a full-time basis as a term of their employment or contract to a \nposition outside Canada with that business, an affiliated enterprise or a client; \n \nthey maintain a connection to a Canadian business; \n \nthey are assigned on a temporary basis to the work assignment; and \n \nthey will continue working for the employer, in Canada, after the assignment. \n6.6 Hardship: Disproportionate \nHumanitarian and compassionate grounds may exist in cases that would not meet the \nunusual and undeserved criteria but where the hardship (of losing residency status) would \nhave a disproportionate impact on the applicant due to personal circumstances. \n6.7 Hardship: Unusual and undeserved \nIn most cases, the hardship (of losing residency status) faced by the applicant should be \nunusual. In other words, a hardship not anticipated by the Act or Regulations, and the \nhardship (of losing residency status) that the applicant would face should be, in most cases, \nthe result of circumstances beyond the person's control. \n7 What is the “travel document” referred to in A31(3)? \nAn applicant seeking a formal determination of residency status must first submit an \napplication for a travel document under A31(3) (IMM 5524E). This travel document allows \npermanent residents of Canada to return home and to resume their residency in Canada \n[A31(3)]. It is printed on the same key control form (IMM 1346-A) as the temporary resident \nand permanent resident visas, and it is distinguished from the other types of visas printed on \nthe counterfoil by the coding (see section 19below). \nThe travel document referred to in A31(3) is not a status document. Rather, it is a Canadian \nimmigration document issued in lieu of a status document—the status document in this case \nbeing the permanent resident card. (For more on the travel document and its relationship to \nthe permanent resident card, see section 5.3 above.) It is also important not to confuse the \ntravel document referred to in A31(3) with those travel documents referred to in R50(1), \nwhich are issued by foreign governments to their citizens in lieu of a passport or other \nidentity document. \n8 Who is entitled to apply for a travel document? \nBefore accepting an application for a travel document, the first step is to determine if the \napplicant is entitled to a document indicating status, as set out in the legislative provisions \nunder A31(1) and A200.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n18 \n8.1 Holders of permanent resident cards \nThe permanent resident card is a status document as defined in the R53(1). A person who is \nin possession of a permanent resident card is presumed to be a permanent resident of \nCanada underA31(2)(a) and may travel back to Canada on the strength of the card, in \nconjunction with a passport or other travel document issued by a foreign government, as may \nbe required. \nIf a person is the rightful holder of a valid permanent resident card, no application for a travel \ndocument may be accepted. Where it is determined that an application has been submitted \nby a person who holds a valid permanent resident card, the application and fee are to be \nreturned unprocessed with an explanation that there is no provision to issue a travel \ndocument to a person holding a valid status document. \nWhere an application has been submitted by a person who holds a permanent resident card \nthat is no longer valid, the visa office must undertake a determination of residency status of \nthat person in conjunction with the processing of that application for a travel document. A \nnew permanent resident card cannot be applied for at a visa office outside Canada, but must \nbe applied for from within Canada [R56(2)]. \n8.2 Holders of records of landing \nThere may be occasions where a visa office discovers in the course of screening an application \nfor a travel document that an applicant holds a record of landing but appears not to have \ncomplied with the requirements of the residency obligation under IRPA. An officer may \ncounsel that person regarding the residency obligation, but must not attempt to seize or \nrevoke the record of landing as the officer has no authority to do so in the absence of a final \ndetermination that the person has failed to comply with the residency obligation [A46(1)(b)]. \nIn any case, the record of landing is not a status document and, therefore, its holder carries \nno presumption of being a permanent resident of Canada. If there is evidence that the holder \nof a record of landing has been out of Canada for more than three out of the past five years, \nand if it appears that the holder may not meet the requirements of the residency obligation, a \nvisa office should accept the application for a travel document and undertake a determination \nof residency status. \n8.3 Holders of returning resident permits (RRP) \nWhere a permanent resident holds an RRP valid for any period spent outside Canada within \nthe two years following the coming into force of the IRPA, this time period is counted as time \nspent in Canada during the applicable five-year period under examination [R328(3)]. \n8.4 No Canadian immigration document proving residency status\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n19 \nPersons who are outside Canada, and who lack Canadian immigration documentation to \nsubstantiate their claim to residency status, may apply at a visa office to obtain a prescribed \ndocument to enable them to be carried by a transportation company back to Canada \n[A148(1)]. In most cases, these persons will have to apply at a visa office for a travel \ndocument in order to return to Canada (except for persons in these circumstances who can \nreach a Canadian port of entry overland via the United States). \nThe visa office will undertake an evaluation of the documentation submitted to confirm the \nidentity of the person concerned and to establish whether that individual ever held residency \nstatus in Canada. If it can be established that the individual was at any time a permanent \nresident of Canada, the visa office can then undertake a determination of residency status to \nverify whether that person has complied with the residency obligation under IRPA. \nIn assessing an application for a travel document submitted without documentation of \nresidency status from Canadian immigration authorities, an officer begins with the \npresumption that the applicant is not a permanent resident [A31(2)(b)]. The burden of proof \nrests on the applicant to demonstrate that they are a permanent resident of Canada. \nThe officer is expected to scrutinize closely any supporting documentation presented that \nmight demonstrate that an applicant physically resides in Canada. Documents that support an \napplicant’s claim to having met the residency obligation should also be closely examined. An \napplicant may submit any kind of documentation that might serve to demonstrate a claim to \npermanent resident status. \n8.5 Persons applying for “facilitation visas” \nPrior to the coming into force of the IRPA, permanent residents outside Canada who had lost \ntheir documentation indicating permanent resident status would often apply for “facilitation \nvisas” to enable them to be carried by a transportation company back to Canada. Under IRPA, \nthe \"facilitation visa\" is no longer issued to permanent residents. Applicants lacking \ndocumentation of their status in the form of an original record of landing or permanent \nresident card are required to apply for the travel document and to undergo a determination of \ntheir residency status. \nFacilitation visas will continue to be issued, on occasion, to Canadian citizens who hold dual \nnationality and who require assistance in returning to Canada on their non-Canadian \npassport. \n9 Procedure: Receiving the application \nUpon receiving an Application for a Travel Document (Permanent Resident Abroad) \n(IMM 5524E), the processing office must stamp the application with the date on which it was \ndelivered to the office. During initial review, if the application is found not to meet the \nrequirements of R10 because it is incomplete, it shall not be processed but will be returned to \nthe applicant in accordance with R12.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n20 \nA separate form must be completed for each applicant, regardless of age. In the case of a \nchild under the age of 14, the application form must be filled out and signed by a parent or \nlegal guardian of the child. The application of a child who is 14 years of age or more, but less \nthan 18 years of age, must be signed by the applicant as well as by one of their parents. If \nsomeone other than the parents is legally responsible for the child, that person must co-sign \nthe application. \nAlthough a separate form is required for each applicant, it is generally desirable to process a \nfamily unit on a single file in CAIPS. Processing spouses and children together on the same \nfile facilitates easy comparison of the information provided. Should some family members \nmeet the residency obligation while others do not, the latter should be removed from the \ncommon file and processed individually on separate files. \nIt must be ensured that the application is checked against FOSS and against the Enforcement \nInformation Index. If the applicant is a non-resident of the country of application, a record \ncheck from the visa office responsible for the country in which the applicant is normally \nresident must be requested. \n10 Procedure: Reviewing the documentation \n10.1 Required documentation \nWhen an application form IMM 5524E is received, it will be reviewed to ensure that: \n \nit is properly completed and signed by the applicant; \n \nrecent passport-size photographs of the principal applicant and of each accompanying \nfamily member have been attached (the name and date of birth of each applicant are to \nbe printed on the back of each photograph); \n \nall required fees and documents have been submitted, including the cost-recovery fee for \nthe application for a travel document ($50.00); and \n \na passport or travel/identity document as defined by R50(1), valid for travel to Canada \n(passport should guarantee re-entry to the country that issued it) is included. \nNote: Applications that do not include these essential elements and accompanying documents \nare to be returned to the applicant. \n10.2 Other documentation which may be requested to determine \nresidency status \nOther documentation that may be required to determine residency status includes: \n \nrecord of landing (if an applicant declares that their record of landing or permanent \nresident card was lost or stolen, a local police report may be requested); \n \nreturning resident permit;\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n21 \n \npermanent resident card; \n \nemployment documents or personal services contract; \n \nrecords of personal services; \n \nfinancial documents; \n \nRevenue Canada Notice of Assessment forms; \n \nevidence of receipt of benefits from Canadian government programs; \n \nrental agreements; \n \nclub memberships; \n \nannual report of a business (incorporated under the laws of Canada or of a particular \nprovince); \n \narticles of incorporation of a business with which the applicant is employed; \n \nreport of the voting interests or ownership of a business, where it is necessary to \ndetermine if the majority ownership of the business is Canadian. \n10.2 Other documentation which may be requested to determine \nrelationship \nOther documentation that may be required to determine the relationship includes: \n \nmarriage licence; \n \nbirth certificate; \n \nbaptismal documents; \n \nadoption or guardianship documents; \n \nschool records; \n \ndocuments demonstrating cohabitation. \nNote: Children under 16 years of age who are travelling alone must have information about the \nperson who will be responsible for them. If the child is the subject of a custody order or is \ntravelling with one parent, proof of custody and/or the other parent’s consent for the trip must \nalso be provided. Minors travelling without their parents require a letter of permission to travel \nfrom the non-accompanying parent(s). The officer’s first duty when children are travelling with \nonly one parent or with a relative/friend is to ensure that they are not being abducted from their \nlawful guardian. \n \nNote: Permanent residents seeking a document to enable them to re-enter Canada can present \nany documentation that serves to demonstrate their claim to permanent residency status, and \nwhich is acceptable to the officer. \n11 Procedure: Undertaking a determination of residency status \nIf it is established that an applicant is entitled to apply for a status document indicating \npermanent residence, the visa office must process the application for a travel document. In\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n22 \nassessing whether a travel document can be issued to an applicant, a determination of \nresidency status must be carried out by an officer. \nThis assessment is an objective process, evaluated against each of the provisions of the \nresidency obligation as defined in A28. An applicant may need to be interviewed to clarify \naspects of an application, but interviewing is by no means required to make an assessment if \nan applicant clearly meets the time-in-Canada provisions set out in A28(2)(a). In many cases, \nthe time in Canada can be verified by comparing the dates of entry into Canada with the \ndates of entry into other countries recorded in an applicant’s passport. In other cases, an \nofficer may have to examine documents from a spouse or common-law partner or, in the case \nof children, of their parents. \nIf the information provided on the application form and the accompanying documentation \nclearly demonstrates that an applicant meets the residency obligation, an interview is not \nrequired. However, where there is doubt concerning the validity or accuracy of facts or \ninformation that are germane to the determination of residency status, an interview may be \nrequired. \nFactors that should be considered in carrying out a determination of residency status are \ndetailed in section 12 below. \n12 Procedure: Guidelines for examining the residency \nobligation \nThe following general guidelines are designed to assist officers who are examining compliance \nwith residency obligations and making decisions on retention and loss of permanent residency \nstatus. The guidelines are not meant to be all-inclusive or limiting. \nSection of the \nAct/Regulations \nExamining the Act \nSuggested information \nand documentary \nevidence\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n23 \nA28(2)(a)(i):Whether a \npermanent resident has been \nphysically present in Canada with \nrespect to a five-year period for \nat least 730 days in that five-\nyear period. \nA permanent resident may \nbe away from Canada for \nthree years in every five-\nyear period, for any reason, \nand be in compliance with \nthe residency obligation. \nAccordingly, if the applicant \nsatisfies an officer that they \nhave been physically \npresent in Canada for at \nleast 730 days in the five-\nyear period being examined, \nit is not necessary to \nexamine or assess other \nfactors regarding the reason \nfor the absence.  \nIf the absence was due to \nemployment abroad, there \nis no need to further \nexamine if the employment \nwas with a “Canadian \nbusiness.” The person would \nsimply be found to have \nsatisfied their residency \nobligation pursuant to \nA28(2)(a)(i). \nThere is no one document \nthat can definitively \nestablish a person’s physical \npresence in Canada. \nHowever, documents will \ntend to confirm and support \nthe person’s declarations \nconcerning residence, \nemployment, and other \naspects of daily life.  \nOfficers should consider all \ninformation and supporting \ndocumentation that could \nserve to provide sufficient \nevidence that the \npermanent resident was \nphysically present in Canada \nfor at least 730 days in the \nfive-year period under \nexamination. \n \nSupporting documentary \nevidence, as applicable, \nmay include: proof of \nemployment, attendance at \nschool, banking activity, \nfinancial records and \nstatements, receipt of \ngovernment benefits, \nrecords of personal \nservices, community \ninvolvement, memberships, \netc. Also to be considered \nare RRPs issued to the \napplicant under previous \nlegislation that pertain to \nthe five-year period under \nexamination. \nA28(2)(b)(i): If a permanent \nresident for less than five years, \nmust demonstrate that they will \nbe able to meet the residency \nobligation during the five-year \nperiod immediately following \nA permanent resident who \nhas had the status less than \nfive years qualifies under \nthe residency obligation, \neven if away from Canada \nfor up to three years \nSupporting documentary \nevidence, as applicable, \nmay include: proof of \nemployment, attendance at \nschool, banking activity, \nfinancial records and\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n24 \ntheir becoming a permanent \nresident. \nfollowing the date of arrival \nin Canada, provided they \ncan potentially meet the \n730-day criteria during the \nfive-year period immediately \nafter arrival in Canada. \nstatements, receipt of \ngovernment benefits, \nrecords of personal \nservices, community \ninvolvement, memberships, \netc. Also to be considered \nare RRPs issued to the \napplicant under previous \nlegislation that pertain to \nthe five-year period under \nexamination. \nA28(2)(b)(ii): If a permanent \nresident for five years or more, \nmust demonstrate that they have \nmet the residency obligation \nduring the five-year period \nimmediately before the \nexamination of their residency \nstatus by an officer. \nAn officer is precluded from \nexamining any period other \nthan the most recent five-\nyear period immediately \nbefore the date the \napplication is received in the \nvisa office. As long as a \npermanent resident can \nmeet the 730-day criteria \nduring the most recent five-\nyear period, earlier \nabsences are not considered \nin the calculation of days. \nEvidence such as entry and \nexit stamps in a passport \nwould indicate periods of \ntime that an applicant was \nphysically present in \nCanada. \nR62(1) and R62(2) :The five-\nyear period does not include any \nday after a decision is made \noutside of Canada that the \npermanent resident has failed to \ncomply with the residency \nobligation, unless the permanent \nresident is subsequently \ndetermined to have complied. \nOnce an officer has made a \ndetermination that an \napplicant has not met the \nresidency obligation, the \ncalculation of days does not \ninclude any day after the \ndecision. If the applicant \nwins on appeal, the \ncalculation of days reverts \nto include the days during \nwhich the decision was \nunder appeal. \n  \nR328(2) and R328(3): Time \nspent outside Canada on a \nreturning resident permit is \ncounted as time spent in Canada \nfor the purpose of satisfying the \nIn the case where a \npermanent resident is a \nholder of an expired \nreturning resident permit, \nthe time period during \nwhich the permit was valid\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n25 \nresidency obligation. \nis counted as time spent in \nCanada during the \napplicable five-year period \nunder examination.

As a result, an officer must complete a \nPR status determination under A28 before issuing almost any type of visa to such a person. \nIf a person who had PR status requests the relinquishment of that status without any other \nconcurrent application, relinquishment cannot be accepted before the person’s actual PR \nstatus is determined. \nThere is no legal mechanism under IRPA to relinquish PR status. \nProcessing \nFor almost any case requiring a PR status determination (see exceptions in Quick Reference \ntables), a Travel Document (Permanent Resident Abroad) (PRTD) application must be created \nin GCMS to record the assessment and the delegated decision-maker’s decision on the PR \nstatus determination. \nIn the absence of a PR status determination recorded in a PRTD record, if the person applies \nagain for a PRTD or applies for a PR card, it can be difficult to establish whether and when a \nprior PR status determination occurred and whether there was a final determination resulting \nin loss of PR status, particularly if the decision appears only in the notes of another \napplication. \nIn addition, if the decision is captured only in the case notes of another application, CIC’s \nsystems will not capture the effort. The processing office will not get credit for the effort for \npurposes such as Cost Management and determining resource requirements. \nCompletion of a PRTD application form may be required even if the person is not applying for \na PRTD if the information needed is not available from the information already on file. \n13.1. PRTD Applications from persons who previously relinquished \nPR status \nIf a person wants to obtain a PRTD but he or she voluntarily relinquished status by signing an \nIMM 1342B under the former Immigration Act or a voluntary relinquishment under IRPA, the \nperson must make an application for a PRTD. An officer must then complete a residency \nstatus determination. The IMM 1342BVoluntary Declaration of Abandonment of Status has no \nlegal effect; neither does a voluntary relinquishment under IRPA. If the applicant meets the \nrequirements of A28, a PRTD can be issued notwithstanding the prior relinquishment. The \napplicant’s intent in completing a Voluntary Declaration or relinquishment should only be \ntaken into consideration if the residency status determination requires an assessment of \nhumanitarian and compassionate considerations. As stated in section 5.4, intent will be taken \ninto consideration as an element of the humanitarian and compassionate assessment. \n13.2 Permanent Resident Visa Applications\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n33 \n13.2.1. Processing for a person who is applying for a new PRV who did \nnot sign an IMM 1342B relinquishing status under the former Immigration \nAct and who has not otherwise lost PR status under former Act or IRPA \nA person may be treated as a foreign national for the purpose of issuing a new Permanent \nResident Visa (PRV) if: \n \nthe determination under A28 is negative; and either \no \nthe person consents in writing to the residency decision and the person waives \ntheir right to appeal the decision, in writing; or \no \nthe appeal period expires without an appeal of the determination being filed. \nThe template for the consent and waiver is attached as Appendix C. \nFor PRV applications processed in CAIPS, the new PRV can be issued in CAIPS after a consent \nand waiver are obtained from the applicant or after the appeal period expires without an \nappeal being filed, whichever comes first. If a consent and waiver are obtained, a scanned \ncopy should be attached to the client’s record in GCMS. If the PRV is issued in CAIPS, there is \nno need to notify Query Response Centre (QRC) and no action is required by QRC. \nFor PRV applications processed in GCMS, before a visa office can issue a PRV to an applicant \nwho previously had PR status, a ‘Lost/Relinquishment’ date must be entered in the client's \nrecord. QRC users are the only designated GCMS users with the authority to enter this \ninformation. QRC can enter this data once a consent and waiver are obtained from the \napplicant or after the appeal period expires without an appeal being filed, whichever comes \nfirst. \nFor QRC to enter this date, a scanned copy of the consent and waiver must be attached to the \nclient’s record in GCMS. An email can then be sent to QRC requesting that a \n'Lost/Relinquishment' date be entered in the client’s record. QRC will enter the date the \nperson’s PR status was lost based on the residency determination date. The service standard \nfor action by QRC on this type of request is five business days from the day the request is \nreceived in QRC. QRC will confirm by email to the requester once the request is complete. \nOnce the 'Lost/Relinquishment' date is entered in GCMS, the new PRV can be issued. \nIf a person is determined to have retained his or her PR status, regardless of whether the PRV \napplication is in CAIPS or GCMS, the PRV application must be withdrawn, the PRV processing \nfee must be refunded, the PRTD fee must be collected and a PRTD must be issued. \nFor procedural information outside of GCMS on refund and collection of fees, refer to \nSections 5.10 and 7.3 respectively in the Cost Recovery Manual for missions. For GCMS cases, \nall refund and fee transactions must be initiated in GCMS. Refer to the content “Immigration \nSpecific” and select “Fees” from the GCMS User Guide for detailed system procedures. \nThe Quick Reference table sets out which documents and which fees are required.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n34 \n13.2.2. Processing for a person who voluntarily relinquished PR status \nby signing an IMM 1342B under the former Immigration Act and is \napplying for a new PRV \nA person who voluntarily relinquished her or his PR status under the former Immigration \nAct may be treated as a foreign national if she or he: \n \nformally signed a document (usually an IMM 1342B Confiscated or Voluntary \nSurrendered IMM 1000Bform) voluntarily declaring abandonment of PR status (this is \nnormally indicated by Field Operations Support System (FOSS) Non-Computer-Based \nEntry (NCB) Code 10: vol relinq of status); and \n \nacknowledges that in signing the IMM 1342B she or he was abandoning PR status. This \nshould be recorded in the officer’s notes and retained on the file. \nIf there is already a record of the loss of status in FOSS or GCMS, a new PRTD record is not \nrequired. \nFor PRV cases processed in CAIPS, the voluntary relinquishment record should be noted and \nthe new PRV can then be issued. \nFor PRV cases processed in GCMS, an email must be sent to QRC asking QRC to enter in \nGCMS the date the person’s PR status was relinquished. The service standard for action by \nQRC on this type of request is five business days from the day the request is received in QRC. \nQRC will confirm by email to the requester once the request is complete. Once the date is \nentered, the visa office can issue the new PRV. \nIf there is no electronic record that QRC can use to date the relinquishment, the procedure in \n13.2.1 must be followed. \nThe Quick Reference table sets out which documents and which fees are required. \n13.2.3. Processing for a person who lost PR status under the \nformer Immigration Act or IRPA by other means and who is applying for \na new PRV \nIf a person lost PR status through the operation of the former Immigration Act or IRPA (e.g., \nthrough deportation), the system record should show that the person is no longer a PR and \nno special processing should be required. \nIf the system has not recorded the person’s loss of status, officers should follow the \nprocedures in 13.2.2 to have QRC make the appropriate entries and to issue the new PRV, \nensuring that any additional requirements (like Authorization to Return to Canada) are met. \nThe Quick Reference table sets out which documents and which fees are required. \nQuick Reference table: Person is applying for PRV\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n35 \nApplicant \nPR Status \nDetermina\ntion \nrequired? \nFee \nApplicable \nCan \nrelinquishm\nent be \ngranted? \nApplication \nrequired \nSupporting \ndocuments \nrequired \nDocument \nto be issued \nto applicant \nRelinquish\ned under \nold Act \nNo \nPRV fee \nN/A \nPRV \napplication \nPRV \ndocuments \nPRV \nOtherwise \nlost PR \nstatus \nNo \nPRV fee \nN/A \nPRV \napplication \nPRV \ndocuments \nPRV, any \nadditional \nrequired \ndocuments \nDoesn’t \nmeet A28 \nrequireme\nnt, never \nlost or \nrelinquish\ned \nYes \nPRV fee; \nuse fee \nexemption \ncode for \nPRTD file \nYes \nPRV \napplication \nConsent \nand Waiver \nPRTD \nrefusal and \nappeal \nrights \nletter, PRV \nMeets A28 \nrequireme\nnts, never \nlost or \nrelinquish\ned \nYes \nPRTD fee; \nPRV fee to \nbe \nrefunded \nN/A \nPRTD \napplication \nEvidence of \nmeeting A2\n8requireme\nnts \nPRTD \n13.3.

Person did not sign an IMM 1342B relinquishing status under the \nformer Immigration Act and is requesting a Temporary Resident Visa \nIf a person was landed under the former Immigration Act or obtained PR status under IRPA \nand the person has never lost PR status, the person shall be treated as a PR. An officer must \ntherefore complete a determination of residency status under A28 before issuing a Temporary \nResident Visa (TRV) to such a person.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n36 \nA person may be treated as a foreign national for the purpose of applying for a Temporary \nResident Visa (TRV) if: \n \nthe determination under A28 is negative; \n \nthe person signs a statement consenting to the decision; and \n \nthe person signs a waiver of the right to appeal the decision. \nThe template for the consent and waiver is attached as Appendix C. \nThe Quick Reference table sets out which documents and which fees are required. \n13.3.2. Person voluntarily relinquished their status by signing an \nIMM 1342B under the former Immigration Act and is requesting a \nTemporary Resident Visa \nA person who voluntarily relinquished his or her PR status under the former Immigration \nAct may be treated as a foreign national if he or she: \n \nformally signed a document (usually an IMM 1342B Confiscated or Voluntary \nSurrendered IMM  1000B form) voluntarily declaring abandonment of permanent resident \nstatus (this is normally indicated by FOSS NCB code 10: vol relinq of status); \n \nis now seeking to enter Canada as a temporary resident; and \n \nacknowledges that in signing the IMM 1342B they were abandoning permanent resident \nstatus. This should be recorded in the officer’s notes and retained on the file. \nIf all of the above conditions are met and the officer is satisfied the person otherwise qualifies \nfor a TRV, a TRV may be issued. Applicants who have previously voluntarily relinquished their \nstatus and now wish to enter Canada as temporary residents should be notified that they \nhave lost their PR status. \nIf there is no system record of a relinquishment under the Immigration Act, or if the person \ndoes not acknowledge that he or she abandoned PR status, the procedure in 13.3.1 must be \nfollowed. \nIn all circumstances where a consent and waiver is obtained, a scanned copy must be \nattached to the client’s GCMS record. If no action is required by QRC, there is no need to \nnotify QRC. \nEven if a client consents to the decision and waives his or her appeal rights, or submits a \nrelinquishment declaration, a PRTD refusal and appeal rights letter must be issued to inform \nthe client that a residency determination has been made that may affect his or her rights \nunder IRPA. If the client consents to the decision and waives her or his appeal rights, there is \nno need to wait until the appeal period expires before issuing a TRV. \nIf the client declines to consent to the negative residency decision and refuses to waive the \nappeal rights, this may be taken into account in assessing the bona fides of her or his\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n37 \ntemporary intent. A PRTD refusal and appeal rights letter must still be issued to inform the \nclient of her or his rights under IRPA. A TRV may be issued if the visa officer is satisfied that \nthe applicant meets the R179 requirements for a TRV, including being satisfied that the \napplicant will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for her or his stay. If the visa \nofficer is satisfied that the applicant meets the requirements for a TRV notwithstanding the \nrefusal to sign the consent and waiver, there is no need to wait until the appeal period expires \nbefore issuing a TRV. \nThe Quick Reference table sets out which documents and which fees are required. \n13.4. Person satisfies the residency obligation in A28 but has \napproached the visa office to relinquish status \n13.4.1. When to accept relinquishment \nIn exceptional circumstances, and provided the person is truly voluntarily relinquishing status \nand fully understands the consequences, the person may be allowed to complete \nform IMM 5539B (Declaration: Relinquishment of Permanent Resident Status/Where the \nResidency Obligation is Met) and can then be treated as a foreign national. A copy of the \nIMM 5539B should be attached to the client’s GCMS record. Officers should always conduct an \nin-person interview when accepting voluntary relinquishment of PR status from a person who \nmeets residency requirements. \nExamples of circumstances where this may be allowed include eligibility for diplomatic or \nother official assignments, eligibility for PR status in another country or other employment \nrelated requirements. \n13.4.2. When not to accept relinquishment \nIf exceptional circumstances of the type described above are not present, relinquishment \nshould not be accepted from a PR who meets residency requirements. The request to \nrelinquish can be refused on the grounds that IRPA does not provide for relinquishment of PR \nstatus. \nThe relinquishment procedure is not to be used instead of completing a residency \ndetermination where the person is seeking to come to Canada only temporarily. \nQuick Reference Tables \nPerson does not want any type of TRV or is a national of a visa-exempt country \nApplicant \nPR Status \nDetermina\ntion \nFee \nApplicable \nCan \nrelinquish\nment be \nApplication \nrequired \nSupporting \ndocuments \nDocument \nto be \nissued to\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n38 \nrequired? \ngranted? \nrequired \napplicant \nMeets A28 \nrequirements \nbut wants to \nrelinquish, no \nspecial \ncircumstances \nYes \nPRTD fee \nNo \nPRTD \napplication \nEvidence of \nmeeting A28 \nrequirements \nPRTD \nMeets A28 \nrequirements \nbut wants to \nrelinquish, \nspecial \ncircumstances \nYes \nPRTD fee \nYes \nPRTD \napplication \nIMM 5539B \n(Declaration: \nRelinquishme\nnt of \nPermanent \nResident \nStatus/Where \nthe \nResidency \nObligation is \nMet) \nCopy of \nIMM 5539B \ncompleted \nby \nDelegated \nPR status \ndecision-\nmaker \n(IPM) \nDoesn’t meet \nA28 \nrequirements, \nwants to \nrelinquish \nYes \nPRTD fee \nYes \nPRTD \napplication \nConsent and \nWaiver \nPRTD \nrefusal and \nappeal \nrights letter \nMeets A28 \nrequirements, \ndoesn’t want \nto relinquish \nYes \nPRTD fee \nN/A \nPRTD \napplication \nEvidence of \nmeeting A28 \nrequirements \nPRTD \nDoesn’t meet \nA28 \nrequirements, \ndoesn’t want \nto relinquish \nYes \nPRTD fee \nN/A \nPRTD \napplication \nEvidence of \nmeeting A28 \nrequirements \nPRTD \nrefusal and \nappeal \nrights letter \n \nPerson requires TRV to travel to Canada\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n39 \nApplicant \nPR Status \nDetermina\ntion \nrequired? \nFee \nApplicable \nCan \nrelinquish\nment be \ngranted? \nApplication \nrequired \nSupporting \ndocuments \nrequired \nDocument \nto be \nissued to \napplicant \nApplying for \nTRV, doesn’t \nmeet A28 \nrequirements, \nwants to \nrelinquish \nYes \nTRV fee \nYes \nTRV \napplication \nConsent and \nWaiver \nPRTD \nrefusal and \nappeal \nrights \nletter, TRV \nApplying for \nTRV, doesn’t \nmeet A28 \nrequirements, \ndoesn’t want \nto relinquish \nYes \nTRV fee \nN/A \nTRV \napplication \nEvidence of \nmeeting A28 \nrequirement; \nTRV \ndocuments \nPRTD \nrefusal and \nappeal \nrights \nletter, TRV; \nTRV if \nofficer \nsatisfied \napplicant \nmeets TRV \nrequiremen\nts \nApplying for \nPRTD, meets \nA28 \nrequirements, \ndoesn’t want \nto relinquish \nYes \nPRTD fee \nN/A \nPRTD \nApplication \nEvidence of \nmeeting A28 \nrequirements \nPRTD \nApplying for \nPRTD, doesn’t \nmeet A28 \nrequirements, \ndoesn’t want \nto relinquish \nYes \nPRTD fee \nN/A \nPRTD \napplication \nEvidence of \nmeeting A28 \nrequirements \nPRTD \nrefusal and \nappeal \nrights letter \n14 Procedure: Factors to be considered when assessing \nhumanitarian and compassionate concerns\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n40 \nManagers cannot be restricted by guidelines; they are obliged to consider all the information \nthey have. Humanitarian and compassionate applications must be reviewed on a case-by-case \nbasis. Applicants are free to make submissions on any aspect of their personal circumstances \nthat they feel would justify retention of their permanent residency status even though they \nhave breached their residency obligation prior to the determination. Whatever is apparent on \nthe file must be considered by the manager before a determination is made. In practical \nterms, given the high level of importance given by Parliament to the loss of permanent \nresident status, it is recommended that the manager give a fair chance to the applicant to \nexpose any possible humanitarian and compassionate grounds for consideration. \nThe following are only examples of the kinds of factors or combinations of factors a manager \nmight consider in determining whether humanitarian and compassionate grounds justify the \nretention of status. Managers should remember that they are not assessing \"intent.\" They are \nexamining circumstances and events that occurred in the last five-year period which led to \nthe particular individual’s breach of residency obligations. The manager is also taking into \naccount the best interests of a child directly affected by the determination and the degree of \nhardship that may be caused as a result of a determination that an individual or family has \nlost their status. \n14.1 Examples of factors to weigh and consider \nThe extent of the non-compliance: \n \nHow long beyond three years in the last five-year period was the person outside of \nCanada? \n \nWas the person employed outside Canada by other than a \"Canadian business\" as \ndescribed in the Regulations? If so, why and for what length of time? \n \nWas the person outside of Canada for more than three years in the last five-year period \nbecause of a medical condition or the medical condition of a close family member? \n \nCould alternative arrangements have been made or was it the applicant’s choice to \nremain outside Canada? \nCircumstances beyond the person’s control: \n \nAre the circumstances that led to the person’s remaining outside of Canada compelling \nand beyond their control? \n \nWas the person prevented from returning to Canada? Why? By whom or by what event? \n \nAre they now returning to Canada at the earliest possible opportunity? \n \nDid the person leave Canada as a child accompanying a parent? \n \nAre they now over 22 years of age and are returning at the earliest opportunity since \nbecoming 22 years of age? \n \nIs the person over 22 years of age dependent on the parent they are accompanying \nbecause of a mental or physical disability? \nEstablishment outside Canada:\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n41 \n \nIs the person a citizen or permanent resident of a country other than Canada? \n \nHas the person taken steps to establish permanently in a country other than Canada? \n \nTo what degree has the person established in Canada? \n \nWhat linkages has the person maintained to Canada? \nPresence and degree of consequential hardship: A loss of permanent resident status \nmay have the consequence of leading to a person’s eventual removal from Canada. The \nremoval of a status-less person may have an impact in relation to family members (i.e., \npermanent residents or Canadian citizens) who have the legal right to remain in Canada. The \nperson’s degree of hardship in relation to their personal circumstances (i.e., the impact on \nfamily members, especially children) should be considered. \n15 Procedure: General factors to be considered in assessing \ncompliance with the residency obligation under A28 \nThe policy surrounding the residency obligation is designed to be fair and generous to \npermanent residents. The legislation provides a variety of means to satisfy the residency \nobligation under A28. Beyond this, the inclusion of humanitarian and compassionate \nconsiderations as an enumerated ground for overcoming any breach of the residency \nobligation indicates that Parliament intended officers to exercise discretion and flexibility in \napproving deserving cases not anticipated in the specific provisions of the legislation. \nThe legislation provides every opportunity to persons who have been granted permanent \nresident status to present evidence as to why they should retain that status. All permanent \nresidents have the right of appeal against any decision made by a manager relating to their \nfailure to meet the residency obligation. Even in cases where permanent residents are unable \nto meet any of the requirements of A28, the legislation provides the opportunity to many of \nthese persons to return to Canada to present their case before the Immigration Appeal \nDivision. \nTaken as a whole, the legislation contains provisions that favour the retention of residency \nstatus, even for persons who have been abroad for considerable periods of time. Even though \nthe onus is on the applicant to present evidence that justifies the retention of residency \nstatus, the flexibility of the provisions of A28 allows a manager to exercise discretion in favour \nof the applicant in circumstances where a reasonable explanation is provided for prolonged \nabsence from Canada. \nHumanitarian and compassionate considerations are present in many of the situations \ninvolved in a prolonged absence from Canada. It is expected that managers will not limit the \nexercise of their discretion with respect to the application of humanitarian and compassionate \nconsiderations only to cases of “unusual and undeserved hardship.” Managers are encouraged \nto exercise their discretion wherever the hardship of losing residency status would have a \ndisproportionate impact on the permanent resident or on their family members, taking into \naccount personal circumstances.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n42 \nNote: There are scenarios where A28 will oblige officers to issue travel documents to \npermanent residents in circumstances where officers would have previously refused to issue \ndocuments under the former Immigration Act, for example, the case of a permanent resident \nwho resided in Canada for two years before returning to their country of origin for the past \nthree years. This person has been refused a returning resident permit because an officer \ndetermined that the applicant had the intent to abandon Canada as a place of residence. \nUnder IRPA, this same applicant would qualify for a travel document to return to Canada \nprovided the residency obligation had been met. The IRPA provisions are applicable to all \npermanent residents who were not finally determined to have lost their residency status \nunder the former Immigration Act, whether or not they were refused a returning resident \npermit. \nNote: It is important that officers not take the illegal or immoral conduct of a permanent \nresident as a justifiable reason to refuse an application for a travel document. For example, \nconsider the case where an officer has reason to believe that a permanent resident who \napplied for a travel document was recently convicted of a serious crime abroad. The \napplicant’s passport indicates that he has been residing in Canada for more than 730 days \nduring the past five years. Under the former Immigration Act, an officer was not obliged to \nissue a facilitation visa to a permanent resident with a criminal conviction to enable that \nperson’s return to Canada. But under IRPA, an officer does not have the discretion to refuse \nto issue a travel document in these circumstances, as the applicant complies with the \nresidency obligation on the basis of the time they have spent in Canada during the previous \nfive years. Despite the fact that the applicant would be inadmissible to Canada in accordance \nwith A36(1), they remain a permanent resident of Canada until an inadmissibility report and a \nremoval order are made against them. The correct procedure under these circumstances is \nfor the officer to issue a travel document to the applicant with the criminal conviction and to \ninform National Headquarters of the details of the case in conformity with the guidelines \nrelating to high profile or contentious cases. For procedures related to high profile and \ncontentious cases, see OP 1, section 15. A “Watch For” is also to be entered into CAIPS to \nalert ports of entry to the fact of the permanent resident’s inadmissibility. Upon arrival in \nCanada, the permanent resident may be subject to an admissibility hearing under A44(2). \n16 Procedure: Refusing the application \nIf it is determined that an applicant does not meet the residency obligation—even after \nconsideration of the humanitarian and compassionate factors connected to the application—\nthe application should be refused. The reasoning behind the determination, including the \nconsideration of the humanitarian and compassionate factors, must be included in the CAIPS \nnotes pertaining to the file. As the CAIPS notes will serve as the principal source of the \nreasons for the decision, it is very important that notes include a summary of all the \ncorrespondence and communication that took place on the file. \nThe CAIPS notes must provide sufficient detail as to how the decision was reached and all \nrefusals must be made by the Immigration Program Manager, Deputy Program Manager or\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n43 \nOperations Manager. The managers must review all the facts, decide upon them and record \ntheir own decision. The CAIPS notes might read: \nI considered all the facts on this application. The 730 days/five years residency obligation test \nis not met. I also considered all available humanitarian and compassionate considerations. [If \nthe applicant has children, identify and define what is in the children’s best interest and \nindicate that these interests were considered in the decision]. \nThe applicant must be provided with a letter outlining the grounds for the refusal. The \nmanager must inform the applicant in a clear and transparent manner why the application is \nrefused and advise the applicant of the circumstances under which the application was \nconsidered. This principle should be followed even in cases that are closed due to a lack of \nresponse from the applicant, as permanent residents are entitled to appeal rights in all cases \ninvolving residency determination. A model refusal letter is contained in Appendix A. \nThe letter outlining the grounds for the refusal should, in all cases, indicate that consideration \nwas given to humanitarian and compassionate factors. If the manager determines that \nhumanitarian and compassionate factors do not justify the retention of status, the written \ndecision (refusal letter) need only refer to the fact that consideration was given to the \nhumanitarian and compassionate factors presented and that the manager is not satisfied that \nthe factors are sufficient to warrant retention of the status. The detailed reasons for the \nrefusal must be documented in CAIPS notes. \nIn the case where additional information is requested and the client does not provide the \ninformation, managers should provide the person with a notice and give them 30 days to \nprovide submissions that relate to A28. If no submissions are received, the manager should \nmake a negative determination decision based on the information that is available. If the \nmanager believes on a balance of probabilities that the person does not satisfy the residency \nrequirements of A28, it should be coded as refused. \n16.1 Best interests of the child \nIn cases where a child is directly affected by a refusal decision, the manager should indicate \nboth in the refusal letter as well as in the CAIPS notes that they actively considered the best \ninterests of the child. It would likely be insufficient to simply state in the refusal letter that \"I \nhave considered the best interests of the children affected by the decision,\" if there is nothing \nfurther in the CAIPS notes. \nIn the Legault case (Legault v. MCI, 2001 FCT 315) it is made clear that the best interests of \nthe child do not \"outweigh\" all other factors; in other words, it is not the case that the \nchildren's best interests should prevail unless there are \"gravest countervailing grounds.\" \nWhat the manager has to do is demonstrate somewhere on the record that they have \ncarefully considered the interests of the children and that these interests have been \n\"identified and defined\" in a manner beyond mere mention. An indication on the record of \nwhat is in the children's interest and the reasons for this opinion would be the minimum \nrequired to demonstrate that the manager was sensitive to the children's interest. This would\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n44 \nmean including in the notes a brief analysis of whether (and why) it would be in the children's \ninterest if the applicant were to be granted humanitarian and compassionate consideration. \n16.2 Appeal rights \nThe refusal letter must also be accompanied by instructions clearly outlining the appeal rights \nof the permanent resident (see Appendix B) as well as by a Notice of Appeal form from the \nIAD. \nAs in the case of appeals of family class applications, the permanent resident whose rights are \naffected by a residency status determination has the right to appeal to the IAD against the \nrefusal of their application. To file an appeal to the IAD, the permanent resident must provide \na notice of appeal and the written reason for refusal to the IRB registry within 60 days of \nbeing informed of the reasons for the refusal of the application. The IAD will notify the \napplicable CBSA hearings office that will request the overseas file and inform that applicable \nvisa office that an appeal has been filed. Once the visa office has received notice of an appeal, \nit will send its file to the applicable hearings office within four weeks. The appeal record and \nproof of compliance must be received by the IAD no later than 120 days after the Minister \nreceives notice of the appeal. (For more on the procedures to prepare the record for appeals \nof determinations of residency status, consult OP 21, section 8.3). \n16.3 Permanent resident status determination and issuance of \npermanent resident travel documents \nAs a first step, the processing of a travel document requires an assessment against the \nresidency obligation of A28(2). While A28(2) is clear, it should be remembered that applicants \nwho acquired permanent resident status less than five years ago but who can meet the two-\nout-of-five-year standard in the five years immediately after they become permanent \nresidents are considered to have met the residency test. \nIn cases where the residency obligation is not met, it is required, as a next step, that officers \nconsider any evidence of humanitarian and compassionate grounds. This consideration must \ntake into account the best interests of a child directly affected by a negative determination. \nFavourable humanitarian and compassionate considerations overcome any breach of the \nresidency obligation prior to the determination (see section 5 above). \nOnly a manager can refuse permanent resident status determinations and sign the letter \nadvising the applicant. Detailed reasons for the negative residency determination, including \nhumanitarian and compassionate consideration, must be documented in the CAIPS notes. A \nnegative residency determination triggers a letter advising the applicant of the outcome. \nThe requirement to issue a travel document is not contingent on a positive residency \ndetermination. There are five scenarios that generate a travel document (see section \n17 below). Of most operational relevance is the requirement imposed by A31(3)(c) that a \npermanent resident outside Canada be issued a travel document if the officer is satisfied that\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n45 \nthey were physically present in Canada at least once within the 365 days before the \nexamination and they made an appeal within 60 days that has not been finally determined; or \nthe period for filing a notice of appeal has not yet expired. \nSimilarly, a travel document must be issued to an applicant, even if the request is made after \nthe 60-day period, if the applicant filed a notice of appeal with the IAD within 60 days of the \nnegative residency determination. \nShould applicants voluntarily declare that they have failed to comply with the A28 residency \nobligations, that they concur with the manager’s negative determination and voluntarily waive \ntheir right to appeal under A63(4), they still have 60 days to reconsider, change their mind \nand file an appeal. \nApplicants who have received a negative residency determination but are entitled to a travel \ndocument under A31(3) are not subject to a second processing fee. Since these individuals \nhave already submitted an application for a permanent resident document, the document \nmust be issued without waiting for a second request from the applicant. Officers do not have \nthe discretion to refuse applications for travel documents as long as the person meets the \nrequirements of A31(3). \nCAIPS coding indicates that a negative residency determination has been made (see section \n18.2below). When issued, the travel document is coded RX to alert ports of entry. The coding \nfor travel documents in general is important as it flags for ports of entry and inland offices the \nresidency determination that has been made overseas (see section 19 below). \nMisrepresentation or fraud found in the application and the inadmissibility provisions of IRPA, \nincluding criminal activity, are not relevant to the issuance of a travel document so long as \none of the A31(3)requirements has been met. For example, where documents demonstrating \ntwo years of residency in Canada are fraudulent but the officer is satisfied the applicant was \nin Canada for any time in the past year, a travel document must be issued and the fraud \nmust be noted in FOSS. \nIn such cases, a “Watch For” posted in FOSS will alert ports of entry and, if appropriate, \ngenerate an admissibility hearing when the person arrives in Canada. When the case has the \npotential to be high profile or contentious, National Headquarters should be informed (see OP \n1, section 15). Officers do not have the authority to seize or revoke records of permanent \nresidence unless it is clear that the person has lost status in accordance with A64. \nVisa offices are reminded that the issuance of a permanent resident (PR) card in Canada does \nnot impact on the determination of permanent resident status overseas. Decisions at visa \noffices are taken on the basis of the facts available. These facts may not be consistent with \nthose provided at the time of the PR card application. \nAdvising in-Canada offices \nAt present, CIC information systems are not fully supportive of the need to share information \nin the client continuum from overseas determination of resident status to the grant of a \npermanent resident card and, ultimately, the grant of Canadian citizenship.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n46 \nOffices should use the “Watch For” capacity in CAIPS/FOSS and coding on the counterfoil to \nalert ports of entry, CPC-Sydney and Citizenship of a negative determination. Permanent \nresident card units do check FOSS records and will interview applicants if they are aware that \nthe A28 provisions may not have been met. \nCitizenship applications \nWhen officers determine that applicants do not comply with the residency obligations \nof A28(2), but that, nevertheless, they have applied for citizenship, they should advise Case \nReview at the latter’s generic e-mail address:  \nNHQ-Citizenship-Case-Review. \n17 Procedure: When to issue the travel document for \npermanent residents \nA travel document is normally issued to a principal applicant and to each of the applicant’s \naccompanying family members by means of a single final decision. The application of a family \nis generally considered as a whole, and there is only a single processing screen with “STATUS \nRETAINED” fields for any given family. But the determination of each family member’s \ncompliance with the residency obligation should be undertaken individually. If any of the \naccompanying family members do not meet the residency obligation, they are to be removed \nfrom the application of the principal applicant and processed on a separate file. \nThere are five cases in which a visa officer will issue a travel document to a permanent \nresident following a determination of residency status: \n1. Where a permanent resident meets the residency obligation, as provided for \nin A28(2)(a) and (b) and A31(3)(a). \n2. Where humanitarian and compassionate considerations overcome the breach of the \nresidency obligation, as provided for in A28(2)(c) and A31(3)(b). \n3. Where an officer has determined that neither 1) or 2) apply, but where the permanent \nresident \na. has been physically present in Canada at least once within the 365 days before \nthe date of application; AND \nb. has made an appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and \nRefugee Board under A63(4) that has not been finally determined; OR \nc. the period for making such an appeal (60 days from the date of the decision of \nthe residency determination) has not yet expired [A31(3)(c)]. \n4. Where an officer has determined that neither 1) nor 2) applies, but where the \nImmigration Appeal Division has ordered a permanent resident to physically appear at an \nappeal hearing in Canada [A175(2)]. \n5. Where an officer has determined that neither 1) nor 2) applies, but where the \nImmigration Appeal Division has allowed the appeal of an appellant who is outside \nCanada and the appellant requires a travel document to return to Canada.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n47 \n18 Procedure: Steps involved in issuing the travel document \nThere are five steps involved in issuing the travel document. For more information, see: \n \nStep 1 – Completion of the “Status Retained” fields, section 18.1 below. \n \nStep 2 – Completion of the “Final Decision” code, section 18.2 below. \n \nStep 3 – If application is approved, issue the travel document, section 18.3 below. \n \nStep 4 – If an application is refused, issue a refusal letter to the applicant, section \n18.4 below. \n \nStep 5 – If an applicant requests issuance of a travel document subsequent to the receipt \nof a refusal letter, section 18.5 below. \nFor more on the processing of applications for travel documents in CAIPS, consult the CAIPS \nUser Guide, Permanent Resident Determination Processing, section 3. \nFor more on appeals of determinations of residency status, consult OP 21, section 9. \nFor more on port-of-entry procedures concerning the treatment of permanent residents \nreturning to Canada on travel documents to pursue appeals of a negative decision relative to \nthe determination of their residency status, consult ENF 23, section 8. \n18.1 Step 1. Completion of the “Status Retained” fields \nUpon completing the documentation concerning the reasons for a determination of residency \nstatus in the CAIPS notes, an officer must enter a final decision in the Permanent Residency \nDetermination module of CAIPS. To do so, the officer must enter the Case Processing Screen \nin this module and complete the “STATUS RETAINED” fields. These fields correspond to \nsections A28(2)(a) and A28(2)(c), which provide for retention of permanent resident status; \nthey prompt the officer to enter the reason why an applicant retained permanent resident \nstatus. \nFor a case to be finalized with a positive decision on initial assessment of an application, the \nofficer must enter a “YES” in one of the lines in the “STATUS RETAINED” fields. If an applicant \nis found to have complied with the residency obligation on the basis of time spent in Canada, \na “YES” must be entered only in that field. None of the other fields need to be entered. If \nnone of the reasons apply, a “NO” entry must be entered in each of the \"STATUS RETAINED\" \nfields. Where none of the “STATUS RETAINED” fields has a positive entry, the applicant is \ndetermined not to have complied with the residency obligation under A28, and the application \nfor a travel document is refused. \n18.2 Step 2. Completion of the “Final Decision” code \nValid entries for the “Final Decision” field in the Permanent Resident Determination module of \nCAIPS are:\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n48 \n1. Passed – meets the residency obligation under one of the provisions of A28(2)(a); \n2. Passed (H&C) – humanitarian and compassionate considerations overcome the breach of \nthe residency obligation, as provided for in A28(2)(c); \n3. Passed (365 days/appeal) – meets neither the residency obligation nor humanitarian and \ncompassionate grounds but \na. has been physically present in Canada at least once within the 365 days before \nthe date of application; AND \nb. has made an appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and \nRefugee Board under A63(4) that has not been finally determined OR \nc. the period for making such an appeal (60 days from the date of the decision of \nthe residency determination) has not yet expired; \n4. Refused; \n5. Withdrawn; \n6. Passed (appeal hearing) – meets neither the residency obligation nor humanitarian and \ncompassionate grounds but the Immigration Appeal Division has ordered appellant to \nappear in person at the hearing. \nNote: The “Final Decision” codes 1, 2, 4 or 5 can be entered when a case is first considered, or \nwhen it has been reopened to correct a decision that has been entered in error. The “Final \nDecision” codes 3 and 6 can be used only after the reopening of a case which was refused in \nCAIPS by a “Final Decision” code of 4. Reopening of a case to enter a 3 or 6 in the “Final \nDecision” screen should be done only after a refusal letter has already been communicated to the \napplicant and where the applicant has responded by requesting the issuance of a travel \ndocument to pursue their appeal rights in Canada, or where the IAD has ordered that the \nMinister allow the appellant to appear physically at a hearing in Canada. \n18.3 Step 3. If application is approved, issue the travel document \nIn most cases, the travel document is to be issued for a single entry with a validity of six \nmonths. Occasionally, there may be cases where a permanent resident of Canada is unable to \napply for a permanent resident card due to their long-term residency abroad. In these rare \ncases, where a permanent resident is unable to apply for the card from within Canada \nbecause of the shortness of their occasional stays in Canada, a multiple-entry travel \ndocument may be issued for a period of validity not exceeding five years. The category to be \nprinted on the travel document counterfoil is R-1. A separate counterfoil will be printed for \neach person included in the application that meets the criteria for issuance. \nIn those cases where an applicant was approved on humanitarian and compassionate \ngrounds, the category to appear on the travel document counterfoil is RC-1. \n18.4 Step 4: If an application is refused, issue a refusal letter to the \napplicant\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n49 \nIf a refusal letter is issued to an applicant, that applicant will be provided with 60 days to file \nan appeal of the decision to the IAD. The applicant loses their status if an appeal of the \ndecision is not filed with the IAD within the 60-day time period allowed pursuant \nto A46(1)(b). \n18.5 Step 5. If an applicant requests the issuance of a travel document \nsubsequent to the receipt of a refusal letter \nThere will be situations where a travel document may be issued with a validity date of less \nthan six months if a tighter control of the issuance of the document is warranted. One such \nsituation is when permanent residents do not meet the residency requirement but have been \nin Canada at least once in the past 365 days. Permanent residents in this situation are \nallowed to enter Canada during the 60-day appeal period even if they have not yet filed an \nappeal. In these cases, the officer should reopen the case and enter a Final Decision of 3. The \ntravel document must be issued, normally with a short validity not exceeding 60 days, to \ncorrespond with the period allowed for submitting the appeal in Canada. The travel document \nis to be coded with a different category in this type of case (RX-1, in place of the standard R-\n1 coding), to signal to the port of entry that the permanent resident has been allowed to \nreturn to submit an appeal in Canada. \nIn the case above, where an appellant is not eligible for a travel document under A31(3), the \nappellant must make an application to the IAD requesting to be physically present at the \nhearing of the case in Canada. Applications must be filed with the IAD and with the Minister \nno later than 60 days after the notice of appeal is filed. If the IAD is satisfied that the \npresence of the permanent resident is necessary, it will order the Minister to permit the \nappellant to go forward to Canada to attend the hearing. Where the IAD has made such an \norder, an officer shall issue a travel document for that purpose [A175(2)]. When the IAD \nagrees to hold a hearing, it issues a document called NOTICE TO APPEAR (form 06c). This \ndocument gives the time and place of the hearing. In many cases, it will indicate that the \napplicant does not need to appear in person, and may instead participate via teleconference. \nIf the IAD agrees that the physical presence is required, this will be done with a document \ncalled NOTICE OF DECISION containing the following text: \n“The application made by the Appellant pursuant to Immigration Appeal Division Rule 46(1), \nto physically appear for his/her hearing on _____ is granted “. \nVisa offices should request both of these documents before agreeing to reopen a refused \nPRTD file, to be certain that the IAD is both aware that the applicant is outside of Canada and \nin agreement that physical presence is required. \nIn these cases, the officer should reopen the case and enter a Final Decision of 6. The travel \ndocument is to be coded with a different category in this type of case (RA-1, in place of the \nstandard R-1 coding), to signal to the port of entry that the permanent resident has been \nallowed to return by virtue of an order of the IAD to attend an appeal hearing in Canada.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n50 \nWhere the Immigration Appeal Division has allowed the appeal of a permanent resident who \nhas remained outside Canada, the visa officer should reopen the case and enter a Final \nDecision of 1. The travel document is to be coded with the standard R-1 coding. \n19 Procedure: Categories on the travel document counterfoil \nR \nPassed with a Final Decision of 1 \nRC \nPassed (H&C) with a Final Decision of 2 \nRX \nPassed (365 days/appeal) with a Final Decision of 3 \nRA \nPassed (appeal hearing) with a Final Decision of 6 \n20 Procedure: Transitional issues \nNote: For more on transitional procedures in CAIPS regarding the conversion from “Returning \nResident” to “Permanent Resident Determination,” consult section 1 of “Permanent Resident \nDetermination” in the CAIPS User Guide. \n20.1 R328(1) – Permanent residents \nPermanent residents, who have not lost their status by way of a final determination under the \nformer Immigration Act, maintain their status as permanent residents under IRPA. Even if \nindividuals have been refused applications for returning resident permits under the \nformer Immigration Act, they have the right to a final determination under the residency \nobligation provisions of IRPA before their status can be revoked under A46. \n20.2 R328(2)– Returning resident permit prior to the coming into force \nof the IRPA \nPermanent residents who were issued a returning resident permit under the \nformer Immigration Act are entitled to have the time period during which the permit was valid \ncounted as time spent in Canada during the applicable five-year period under examination for \nthe purposes of determining compliance with the residency obligation.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n51 \n20.3 R328(3) – Returning resident permit following the coming into \nforce of the IRPA \nWhere a permanent resident holds an RRP valid for any period of time within the two years \nimmediately following the coming into force of the new Act, this time period is counted as \ntime spent in Canada during the applicable five-year period under examination. A person \ndetermined to be a permanent resident under the former Act continues to be a permanent \nresident under IRPA.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n52 \nAppendix A Refusal letter – Residency status determination \nINSERT LETTERHEAD \nOur Ref.: \nINSERT ADDRESS \nDear: \nThis letter refers to the determination of your status as a permanent resident of Canada. \nAfter careful and thorough consideration of all aspects of your application and of the \nsupporting information provided, I have determined that you have not complied with the \nrequirements of the residency obligation under section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee \nProtection Act. \nPursuant to subsection 28(2) of the Act, a permanent resident complies with the residency \nobligation provisions with respect to a five-year period if, for at least 730 days in that five-\nyear period, the permanent resident is: \n(i) physically present in Canada; \n(ii) is outside Canada accompanying Canadian citizen who is their spouse or common-law \npartner or is a child accompanying a parent; \n(iii) is outside Canada employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or in the public \nservice of Canada or of a province; \n(iv) is an accompanying spouse, common-law partner or child of a permanent resident who is \noutside Canada and is employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or in the public \nservice of Canada or of a province. \nFor the purposes of determining whether you have met the residency obligation, I have \nexamined the five-year period immediately before (the date of receipt of the application). \nI have also examined all of the documentation that you have provided in support of your \napplication for a travel document. I have concluded that you have not complied with the \nresidency obligation for at least 730 days in the five-year period immediately before (the \ndate of receipt of the application). I have exercised my discretion in reviewing the \nhumanitarian and compassionate considerations connected to your personal circumstances \nthat you have presented with your application. \n(If the applicant has children) I have also taken into account the best interests of the child \n(or children) directly affected by the determination of your residency status. \n(For all applicants) Having considered all of the evidence that you have presented, I am not \nsatisfied that your personal circumstances involve humanitarian and compassionate \nconsiderations that justify the retention of permanent resident status. \nA person loses permanent resident status only on a final determination of a decision made \noutside of Canada that the person has failed to comply with the residency obligation under\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n53 \nsection 28 of the Act. The appeal provisions under subsection 63(4) provide a permanent \nresident the right to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and \nRefugee Board against a decision made outside of Canada on the residency obligation under \nsection 28 of the Act. \nUnder the Immigration Appeal Division Rules, an appellant must provide it with a copy of this \nletter as well as a completed Notice of Appeal form and a copy of the Letter Notifying \nApplicant of Appeal Rights (see enclosures). The completed forms must be received by the \nregistry office of the Immigration Appeal Division for the region in Canada where you, the \nappellant, last resided no later than SIXTY (60) DAYS after having received the written \ndecision. \nShould you choose to submit an appeal of this decision concerning your non-compliance with \nthe residency obligation under section 28 of the Act, your appeal will take place in Canada \nbefore the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. If you wish to \nreturn to Canada for the hearing of the appeal you must state this in the Notice of Appeal that \nyou send to the Immigration Appeal Division. \nIf you have been in Canada at least once during the past 365 days, you are entitled to a \ntravel document to enable your return to Canada. \nIf you have not been in Canada at least once during the past 365 days, you must apply to the \nImmigration Appeal Division for authorization to be physically present at the hearing of your \nappeal in Canada. To be granted authorization to do this, you must first file your appeal with \nthe Immigration Appeal Division no later than SIXTY (60) DAYS from the date you receive \nthis letter. \nYour request to be present at your appeal hearing may be submitted on the “Notice of \nAppeal” form that is attached to this letter. However you submit your request to attend the \nappeal hearing, your request must be submitted no later than SIXTY (60) DAYS after you \nfile the Notice of Appeal. If the Immigration Appeal Division is satisfied that your presence is \nrequired at the hearing, a travel document will be issued to enable you to return to Canada. \nYou will be asked to present your passport and appeal documents to this office before the \ntravel document is issued. \nShould you choose not to submit an appeal of this decision to the Immigration Appeal Division \nin Canada, this decision concerning your non-compliance with the residency obligation under \nsection 28 of the Act will become a final determination of your residency status. You will be \ninadmissible to Canada as a permanent resident for failing to comply with section 28. You will \nbe considered to have lost your status as a permanent resident of Canada, in accordance with \nparagraph 46(1)(b). You will not be allowed to enter Canada as a permanent resident, in \naccordance with subsection 19(2). \nPlease attach a copy of this letter with any Notice of Appeal or correspondence that you may \ndirect to an office of the Immigration Appeal Division or to a Canadian immigration office \noverseas. \nYours sincerely,\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n54 \nImmigration Program Manager\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n55 \nAppendix B Letter notifying applicant of appeal rights \nThis letter refers to the determination of your permanent resident status in Canada. \nI regret to inform you do not meet the requirements of the residency obligation contained in \nsection 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have attached a copy of the letter \nexplaining the reason(s) for refusal. \nSubsection 63(4) of the Act allows permanent residents who have been determined to have \nlost their permanent resident status the right to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division \n(IAD). The appeal may be submitted on the following grounds: \n \na question of law or fact, or mixed law and fact; \n \na principle of natural justice has not been observed; and \n \nthere exist humanitarian and compassionate considerations that warrant the granting of \nspecial relief in light of all the circumstances of the case. \nYou may commence an appeal by completing the enclosed Notice of Appeal and mailing it \nwith a copy of this letter and the officer’s written decision to the address of the Immigration \nAppeal Division registry office for the region in Canada where you last resided. The address of \nthe IAD registry offices may be found on the attachment entitled “Important Instructions.” \n(Officer: Please attach “Important Instructions”). \nIn addition, one of the following applies to you: \n Based on the information you provided, you are entitled to a travel document pursuant to \nparagraph 31(3)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which states: \n31.(3) A permanent resident outside Canada who is not in possession of a status document \nindicating permanent resident status shall, following an examination, be issued a travel \ndocument if an officer is satisfied that \n(c) they were physically present in Canada at least once within the 365 days before the \nexamination and they have made an appeal under subsection 63(4) that has not been finally \ndetermined or the period for making such an appeal has not yet expired. \n Based on the information you provided, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection \nAct you are NOT entitled to a travel document. However, you may apply to the Immigration \nAppeal Division for permission to travel to Canada for your appeal hearing. \nSubsection 175(2) of the Act reads as follows: \n175. (2) In the case of an appeal by a permanent resident under subsection 63(4), the \nImmigration Appeal Division may, after considering submissions from the Minister and the \npermanent resident and if satisfied that the presence of the permanent resident at the \nhearing is necessary, order the permanent resident to physically appear at the hearing, in \nwhich case an officer shall issue a travel document for that purpose.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n56 \nIf you wish to return to Canada for the hearing of the appeal, you must make an application \nto the Immigration Appeal Division. Information stating how to apply to return to Canada for \nyour hearing can be found on the attachment entitled “Important Instructions.” \nIf you do not wish to return to Canada, your appeal may be conducted through \ntelecommunication with the Immigration Appeal Division. \nYou must attach two copies of this letter and two copies of the refusal letter with your Notice \nof Appeal. The completed form and attachments must be received by the IAD within SIXTY \n(60) DAYS from the date of this letter.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n57 \nAppendix C Consent to decision on residency obligation and \nwaiver of appeal rights resulting in loss of status \nunder A46(1)(b) \nName of Office: \nFile No: \nDate: \nSubject: \nSubject’s Record of Permanent Residence No: \nPart 1 – Voluntary consent to determination of failure to comply with residency obligations \nI, ____________________________, voluntarily declare that I have failed to comply with the \nresidency obligations under section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I \nconsent to the officer’s decision on the residency obligation under section 28. \nPursuant to subsection 28(1) of the Act, a permanent resident must comply with a residency \nobligation with respect to every five-year period. \nPursuant to paragraph 28(2)(a) of the Act, the following provisions govern the residency \nobligation under subsection 28(1): \n28. (2)(a) a permanent resident complies with the residency obligation with respect to a five-\nyear period if, on each of a total of at least 730 days in that five-year period, they are \n(i) physically present in Canada, \n(ii) outside Canada accompanying a Canadian citizen who is their spouse or common-law \npartner or, in the case of a child, their parent, \n(iii) outside Canada employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or in the public \nservice of Canada or of a province, \n(iv) outside Canada accompanying a permanent resident who is their spouse or common-law \npartner or, in the case of a child, their parent and who is employed on a full-time basis by a \nCanadian business or in the public service of Canada or of a province, or \n(v) referred to in regulations providing for other means of compliance. \nSection 328 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations reads: \n328. (1) A person who was a permanent resident immediately before the coming into force of \nthis section is a permanent resident under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. \n(2) Any period spent outside Canada within the five years preceding the coming into force of \nthis section by a permanent resident holding a returning resident permit is considered to be a \nperiod spent in Canada for the purpose of satisfying the residency obligation under section 28 \nof the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act if that period is included in the five-year period \nreferred to in that section.\nOP 10 Permanent Residency Status Determination \n2015-01-23 \n \n58 \n(3) Any period spent outside Canada within the two years immediately following the coming \ninto force of this section by a permanent resident holding a returning resident permit is \nconsidered to be a period spent in Canada for the purpose of satisfying the residency \nobligation under section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act if that period is \nincluded in the five year period referred to in that section. \nIn making this declaration, I fully acknowledge the nature and consequences of my decision. \nI am signing this declaration of my own volition, not due to force or the influence of any other \nperson and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing \nthat it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath. \nSigned at _____________________, in the country of _________ \nOn the ______ day of ________of the year ___________. \nSignature of person__________________ \nWitnessed by __________________________ \n  \nPart 2 - Voluntary waiver of right to appeal a decision on the residency obligation under \nsection 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. \nI hereby acknowledge that I have the right under subsection 63(4) of the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Act to appeal the officer’s decision under section 28 to the Immigration \nAppeal Division, within 60 days after receiving the written decision. \nSubsection 63(4) of the Act reads: \n63. (4) A permanent resident may appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against a \ndecision made outside of Canada on the residency obligation under section 28. \nNotwithstanding my right under subsection 63(4) of the Act, I hereby voluntarily waive my \nright to appeal this decision, effective immediately. \nIn so doing, I fully acknowledge the consequences of my decision.
