This occurs when a protected person has been found inadmissible under \nsection A34, section A35, subsection A36(1) or section A37 and is the subject of a removal order that is in \nforce. The officer must obtain their manager’s approval before submitting a case to the DAS, CBSA, \nNHQ. \n7.2 When to request the Minister’s opinion \nAfter removal order [A115(2)(a)] \nThe officer may initiate a request for the Minister’s opinion when \n• \na protected person or a person who is recognized as a Convention refugee is found inadmissible \non grounds of serious criminality; and  \n• \nthat person constitutes, in the opinion of the officer, a danger to the public in Canada.  \nAfter removal order [A115(2)(b)] \nThe officer may initiate a request for the Minister’s opinion when \n• \na protected person or a person who is recognized as a Convention refugee is inadmissible on \ngrounds of security, violating human or international rights or organized criminality; and\nENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and severity of the acts committed and \ndanger to the security of Canada \n2017-11-21 \n \n14 \n• \nthe person concerned is a person who, in the opinion of the officer, should not be allowed to \nremain in Canada on the basis of the nature and severity of acts committed or of danger to the \nsecurity of Canada. \nOfficers must consult with the DAS of the CBSA for guidance before initiating a request for a danger \nopinion pursuant to paragraph A115(2)(b). \nAfter removal order [A115(2)(a) and (b)] \nIn hybrid cases, the officer should initiate a request for the Minister’s opinion when \n• \na protected person or a person who is recognized as a Convention refugee is inadmissible on \ngrounds of security, violating human or international rights, or organized criminality as well as on \ngrounds of serious criminality; and \n• \nthe person concerned is a person who, in the opinion of the officer, constitutes a danger to the \npublic and is a danger to the security of Canada or should not be allowed to remain in Canada on \nthe basis of the nature and severity of acts committed. \nDetained cases \nIn the case of a person who is detained for serious criminality, the officer who initiates a request for the \nMinister’s opinion should do so at least one year prior to the date of the person’s earliest anticipated date \nof release. \n7.3 Determinant factors  \nIn determining whether to seek the Minister’s opinion on danger to the public, the officer must examine \nthe seriousness and nature of the offence to ensure that they support the officer’s decision that the \nperson represents an unacceptable risk to the public and is likely to commit offences in the future.  \nThe officer must not only consider the conviction and sentence, but also \n• \ninclude an analysis of the person’s past and current offences and activities in the \nrecommendation; and \n• \nindicate that, if the person is considered to be a danger to the public, a request for the Minister’s \nopinion may be initiated.\nENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and severity of the acts committed and \ndanger to the security of Canada \n2017-11-21 \n \n15 \nIn determining whether to seek the Minister’s opinion on danger to the security of Canada or on the basis \nof the nature and severity of the acts committed, the officer must examine the seriousness and nature of \nthe person’s actions or the actions of the organization of which the person was a member if it is \ndetermined that the person made a contribution to the nefarious activities of the organization. \nIn cases of danger to the security of Canada, the officer will also consider what activities there are \nreasonable grounds to believe the individual may engage in in the future. \nFor all requests pursuant to paragraph A115(2)(b) cases, the officer will submit a request for guidance \nfrom the DAS of the CBSA prior to providing notification to the person concerned that a danger opinion \nwill be sought in their case. Upon receipt of such a request, the DAS will review the information provided \nand complete a pre-assessment to determine if the CBSA should move forward in seeking the Minister’s \nopinion. \nNote: All available and the most up-to-date documentation relevant to the case must be included with the \nrequest for a danger opinion. \n7.4 Factors \nCriminal factors \nThe following factors must be considered in the preparation of a danger opinion submission for serious \ncriminality as well as for organized criminality: \n• \ncriminal history and established patterns of violent criminal behaviour or threats of violent \nbehaviour that suggest present and future danger to the public, and evidence to support the \nperson’s pattern of behaviour; \n• \nconvictions for serious offences involving but not limited to violence, weapons, drug trafficking, \nhuman smuggling and trafficking, sexual offences and economic crimes; \n• \ndocuments illustrating an escalation of violence or of gravity in the convictions; \n• \nconvictions for actions by the person that caused or might reasonably be expected to have \ncaused death, serious physical or psychological harm or significant property damage; \n• \nevidence to substantiate the link between the criminal conviction, the likelihood that the person \nwill re-offend and a pattern of increasingly serious criminal activity; \n• \npolice, correctional services or other credible source information indicating that the person \ncontinues to pose a danger to the public; \n• \nthe circumstances of the offence(s) in order to provide insight into the level of risk the person may \npresent to the public;\nENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and severity of the acts committed and \ndanger to the security of Canada \n2017-11-21 \n \n16 \n• \nevidence of rehabilitation on the part of the individual (education or training certificates, \npsychological reports, reports from the parole officer, evidence of employment, etc.); \n• \nmultiple convictions, including serious offences, that could form the basis for a danger opinion; \n• \na single conviction that may sustain a finding of danger to the public if it is clearly demonstrated \nthat the person poses a present or future risk of danger to the public, as evidenced by the nature \nand circumstances of the offence. The jurisprudence indicates that it is possible to base a danger \nopinion on a single serious conviction when sufficient evidence exists.  \nDanger to the security of Canada and the nature and severity of the acts \ncommitted: factors \nThe following are some of the factors that must be considered in the preparation of a danger opinion \nbased on danger to the security of Canada or on the nature and severity of the acts committed: \n• \nacts committed by the individual or the group, if applicable; \n• \nactivities undertaken by the person in the furtherance of the group’s objectives; \n• \nthe level of involvement of the person in the acts committed by the organization; and \n• \nthe level of threat either direct or indirect that the person presents to the security of Canada. \n7.5 Procedural fairness  \nThe decision-making process for a Minister’s opinion must adhere to the principles of procedural fairness. \nThe person concerned must be fully informed of the case and be given a reasonable opportunity to \nrespond to any information the decision maker will use to arrive at a decision. A copy of all \ndocumentation that will be put before the decision maker must be provided to the person concerned. \nExceptionally, information may be used that cannot be disclosed to the person concerned where the \ndisclosure of this information would be injurious to national security or would endanger the safety of any \nperson. In such circumstances, all efforts should be made to provide as much information as possible to \nthe person concerned and to limit the amount of undisclosed information to be considered. Consultation \nwith the DAS, CBSA, is required in such circumstances.\nENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and severity of the acts committed and \ndanger to the security of Canada \n2017-11-21 \n \n17 \n7.6 Notification letter: intent to seek the Minister’s opinion \nNotification letter \nAs soon as a CBSA manager or supervisor agrees with the officer to seek a Minister’s opinion, the person \nconcerned must be notified by letter. In paragraph A115(2)(b) cases, this happens only after consultation \nwith the DAS at the CBSA, NHQ.

The DAS, CBSA, NHQ, must be made aware of such \nrequests and will inform the IRCC decision maker, who must always be made aware of such requests.\nENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and severity of the acts committed and \ndanger to the security of Canada \n2017-11-21 \n \n23 \nAll submissions must be accepted by the local responsible office and referred to the appropriate section \nat NHQ, regardless of whether an extension was granted.  \n7.14 Following receipt of submissions \nUpon receipt of a submission, the CBSA regional office will forward the following documentation to the \nDAS, CBSA: \n• \nany submissions made by the subject or their counsel (depending on the size of the material, this \ncan be done electronically or via mail); \n• \na copy of the signed disclosure letter sent to the client; and \n• \nany additional evidence being introduced by the local responsible office that has been disclosed \nto the client.  \n7.15 After the Minister’s delegate’s danger opinion decision \nAfter the Minister’s delegate issues an opinion under paragraphs A115(2)(a) and/or (b), a copy of the \ndecision will be sent by IRCC’s Case Management Branch, NHQ, to the DAS, CBSA, NHQ, who will then \nforward the decision to the originating CBSA office for further action. \nThe manager of the originating CBSA office is responsible for notifying the person concerned \nimmediately, in writing, of the decision. Notice should also be provided to the person’s counsel when one \nis on file. \nIf the person is to be removed, the process will require coordination with the local Removals Screening \nUnit. \n7.16 Reconsideration of danger opinion \nNote 1: Requests for reconsideration will not stay the processing of a case, including removal. The \nremovals officer is responsible for deciding whether a deferral of removal is appropriate in each case. \nNote 2: Where the subject of a danger opinion pursuant to section A115(2)(a) has obtained a record \nsuspension for the underlying serious criminality conviction(s), please request advice from the CBSA \nDanger Assessments Section (DAS) (CBSA-ASFC_Danger_Assessments-\nEvaluations_De_Danger@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca), who will consult with the IRCC Case Management Branch. \nUpon receipt of a request for reconsideration of a danger opinion, the local CBSA office will forward the \nrequest to the CBSA DAS. A decision maker at the IRCC Case Management Branch will then be \nassigned to make a decision on the request.\nENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and severity of the acts committed and \ndanger to the security of Canada \n2017-11-21 \n \n24 \nA decision maker will review the request and determine whether to reopen the original danger decision \nbased on whether the request (along with any accompanying submissions) demonstrates one of the \nfollowing: \no New evidence has been submitted that meets all of the following criteria:  \na) Reliable: Is the evidence reliable, considering its source and the circumstances \nin which it came into existence?  \nb) Relevance: Is the evidence relevant to the decision type, in the sense that it is \ncapable of proving or disproving a fact that is relevant to the proceeding? \nc) Materiality: Is the evidence material, in the sense that the decision maker may \nhave come to a different conclusion if it had been known?  \nd) Newness: Is the evidence new in the sense that it is capable of \ni. \nproving the current state of affairs in the country of removal; \nii. \nproving a fact that was unknown at the time of the original decision; \niii. \ncontradicting a finding of fact made by the original decision maker? \no \nA principle of natural justice was violated by the original decision maker. \nReopening and reconsidering \nWhere the decision maker decides that a reopening of the original danger opinion is required based on either \nor both of the 2 above assessments, it becomes as though the initial decision was never finalized, and a \nnew decision must therefore be made. This second decision is termed the reconsideration decision. \nBefore the new decision is rendered, the subject of the danger opinion and/or their counsel should be \ninformed of the decision to reconsider, and a further opportunity for submissions should be provided. \nRefusal to reopen and reconsider \nAlternatively, after reviewing the request to reconsider and any new submissions made in support of the \nrequest, the decision maker may deny the request. The decision maker must explain the reasons for \nrefusing to reopen the original decision with regard to the applicant’s submissions and the policy \nguidelines. This may be done in letter format. \n7.17 Info-alert \nThe Immigration Cases Division, Case Management Branch will enter an info-alert in the Global Case \nManagement System (GCMS) regarding the decision of the Minister’s delegate concerning a request for \na danger opinion or a request for reconsideration.\nENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and severity of the acts committed and \ndanger to the security of Canada \n2017-11-21 \n \n25 \nAppendix A Letter advising the client that the CBSA will seek \nthe Minister’s opinion on the basis of paragraph A115(2)(a) \nSubject: Notice of intention to seek the opinion of the Minister, pursuant to paragraph 115(2)(a) of the \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act, that you are a danger to the public in Canada \n[Person’s name]: \nYou are hereby advised that the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) possesses information \nsuggesting you are a person in Canada who is a danger to the public.
