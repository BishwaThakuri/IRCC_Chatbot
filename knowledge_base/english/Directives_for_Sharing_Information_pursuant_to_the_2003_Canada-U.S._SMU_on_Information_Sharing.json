The \nlist also includes the new position of Acting Director and Management Analyst in the Fraudulent \nDocument Analysis Unit of the U.S. National Targeting Center.   \n \nOther minor changes were also made.\nIN 2 Directives for Sharing Information Pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. \nStatement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing \n \n2014-01-17 \n3 \n1. \nWhat this chapter is about \n \nThis chapter provides practical direction on sharing information under the terms of the 2003 \nStatement of Mutual Understanding (SMU) on Information Sharing among the Department of \nCitizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) \nand the U.S. Department of State (DOS).  \n \nNote: The CBSA and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are specified in Appendix C as \nsuccessor participants in the SMU.  \n \nFor the complete text of the SMU, see:  \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/laws-policy/smu/smu-ins-dos.asp \n \nNote: Annexes to the SMU address any additional requirements or provisions applicable to specific \ntypes of information described in the Annexes to the extent that those provisions are different from, or \nnot described in, the SMU. It is to be noted that to date, only one such Annex exists and is titled \n“Annex Regarding the Sharing of Information on Asylum and Refugee Status Claims to the Statement \nof Mutual understanding on Information Sharing.” See:  \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/laws-policy/smu/smu-ins-annex1.asp \n \n2. \nObjectives  \n \nTo provide an information-sharing mechanism for Canadian and U.S. officials responsible for the \nenforcement and administration of citizenship and immigration laws in their respective \njurisdictions.  \n \n3. \nActs and Regulations \n \nAll sharing of information must be carried out in full compliance with Canadian law. See IN 1, the \n“Overview on Information-Sharing” chapter of the Information Sharing Manual, for more \ninformation.  \n \nNote: If further guidance is required to determine whether personal information may be shared, please \ncontact the Regional Privacy Coordinator.  \n3.1. \nForms  \nForm title \nForm Number \nRecord of Information Sharing  \nIMM 5570B \n4. \nInstruments and delegations \n \nCanadian and U.S. officials designated with the authority to share information under the terms of \nArticle 7 of the SMU are listed in Appendix A of this Chapter. \n \n5. \nDepartmental policy \n \n5.1. \nPurpose(s) for sharing information  \nPursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of the SMU, information may be provided upon request, or \nproactively, when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the information is necessary in \norder to: \n \n \nadminister or enforce Canadian or U.S. citizenship and immigration laws;\nIN 2 Directives for Sharing Information Pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. \nStatement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing \n \n2014-01-17 \n4 \n \nprevent, investigate or punish conduct that would constitute a crime rendering a person \ninadmissible or removable under the citizenship or immigration laws of either Canada or the \nU.S.; \n \nfacilitate the secure flow of people to Canada or the United States; and \n \nuse the information for statistical or research purposes, provided that such use does not \nidentify persons.  \n \n \n \nExemption from the obligation to provide information \nIf the designated official receiving a request for information determines that the information \nrequested is not compatible with the purposes set out in the SMU, would be detrimental to \nnational sovereignty, or is inconsistent with Canada’s laws, they are not obligated under this SMU \nto share the information. [Article 9 of the SMU] \n \nCanadian officials are to take all reasonable care that: \n \nactions taken using information received from the U.S. are based on accurate and up-to-date \ninformation; \n \ninformation provided to U.S. officials is accurate and up-to-date.  \n \n5.2. \nWho is permitted to share information \n \nUnder Article 7 of the SMU, parties must designate officials for the purpose of exchanging \ninformation. Information may only be exchanged between the designated officials of each party.  \n \n5.3. \nWhat type of information may be shared \n \nAppendix B (Article 5 of the SMU) lists information that may be shared; however, it is not an \nexhaustive list as not all circumstances that will lead to the need to share information can be \nanticipated. Therefore, designated Canadian officials may share information not listed in \nAppendix B, provided that it is relevant to the request and consistent with the purposes set out in \nArticle 2 of the SMU, and provided that such sharing is permitted by Canadian law.  \nOnly information already in the hands of participants may be shared, as the terms of the SMU do \nnot provide for the collection of information on behalf of other participants. \n \n \n \nSharing  information contained in the Personal Information Form (PIF) including the PIF \nitself, Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) decisions and reasons for the decisions  \n \nThe PIF is used to collect information about a refugee claimant. These forms are distributed by \nCIC or CBSA officers as part of a refugee claim package, however they are processed by the \nIRB. The information contained in the PIF is used by the IRB in its decision-making process. The \nIRB decisions (including the reasons for decision) are lawfully shared with CIC and the CBSA. As \nsuch, if the IRB decisions (including the reasons for decision) are shared in a manner consistent \nwith the SMU, that is to uphold citizenship and immigration laws, then the PIF may also be shared \nwith the U.S. designated officials by CIC or the CBSA under the conditions noted in section 5.4.   \n \nDesignated officers should take care to disclose only the information that is actually requested \nand, if additional information is to be disclosed, it should be relevant to the perceived purpose or \nobjective. Disclosure of more personal information than was required, or personal information \nabout someone else, which has no link to the intended purpose, may subject the Canadian \norganization disclosing the information to an improper disclosure complaint and finding by the \nPrivacy Commissioner. Such disclosure may also violate the privacy protections established \nunder the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A determination as to whether other \nindividuals’ information, contained on a PIF, is relevant would be made on a case-by-case basis. \nProactive disclosures are a judgment call. However, no more information with respect to other \npersons than is reasonably considered relevant should be released. Ultimately, officers must be\nIN 2 Directives for Sharing Information Pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. \nStatement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing \n \n2014-01-17 \n5 \nable to justify that each piece of personal information that was disclosed was necessary and that \nthe disclosure of this information was reasonable.  \n \n5.4. \nConditions under which information may be shared \n \nWhen a U.S. designated official requests information, the officer receiving the request should \nascertain precisely what information is to be shared and for what purpose. Specific questions \nabout the case, about the law being administered or enforced, if the information is to be used in a \nhearing, and details about the type of hearing should be asked.  \n \nPrior to sharing the information, designated officers should: \n \n \nconsider whether the information being provided is likely to result in danger to any person or \nto cause a serious injustice. Especially in cases of sharing information regarding \nrefugees/refugee claimants, officers should consider whether the shared information would \ncompromise the safety and security of refugees/refugee claimants and whether it may directly \nor indirectly put them or their family in danger or at risk of persecution/torture, or would create \n\"sur place\" refugees; \n \n \nensure that it is consistent with the purposes set out in the SMU; \n \n \nin the case of a request for information, ensure that the information provided is relevant to the \nrequest being made; and \n \n \nconsider the subsequent use of this information (that is, to be used at an immigration hearing, \nother legal proceedings, an open forum or provided to another agency; refer to section 5.7 \nbelow). In cases of refugees/refugee claimants, disclosure of information in a public forum \nmay compromise the safety and security of refugees/refugee claimants or their families or put \nthem or their family in danger or at risk of persecution/torture, or may create “sur place” \nrefugees. \n \nOfficers should keep in mind that under Article 9 of the SMU, officers may decline to provide \ninformation for reasons of inconsistency with the laws of their country, risk to national sovereignty, \nsecurity, public policy or national interest. Officers can also consider providing the information in \nwhole or in part and subject to such conditions as are deemed appropriate under the specific \ncircumstances. Officers are reminded that all information provided to and received from the U.S. \nis shared with an express understanding of \"strict confidentiality.\" Therefore, when providing \ninformation to the U.S., a caveat should be included indicating that the information is \nprovided in confidence, that it is the property of CIC/the CBSA and may not be disclosed \nwithout the prior written consent of the originator. \n \n5.5. \nMethods of sharing information between participants \n \nWhen reasonable and practical, requests between participants in the SMU should be made in \nwriting (that is, letter, fax, e-mail). When this is not possible, written confirmation of an oral \nrequest must be made as soon as possible.  \nAll requests for information must indicate the reason for the request and the purpose for which \nthe information is to be used. Sufficient background information should accompany the request so \nthat the other participant can respond. \nInformation may be provided orally, electronically (fax, e-mail, CD, etc.), or in paper format.  All \ninstances of information-sharing must be recorded (refer to section 5.8 below). \nPrior to being shared, all personal information must be headed or watermarked “Received in \nconfidence pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. SMU on information-sharing” (or a similar title that \nreflects this agreement). For additional clarity the officer may also indicate that the information is\nIN 2 Directives for Sharing Information Pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. \nStatement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing \n \n2014-01-17 \n6 \nthe property of CIC/the CBSA and may not be disclosed without prior consent of the orginator. \nThis may be done electronically or it may be handwritten. Original documents should be returned \nto the originator within 15 days. If the documents cannot be returned within 15 days, \narrangements to return the documents should be made when the documents are initially \ntransferred.   \nUpon request by a participant in the SMU, originators are to certify copies of records as true and \ncorrect in an agreed manner (e.g., rubber stamp, signature).  \nThe systematic sharing of information may only be carried out when authorized as per the terms \ncontained in any Annex of the SMU and may be for any of the purposes stated in 5.1 of this \nchapter or as further provided in the relevant Annex. \n5.6. \nFurther sharing of information \nAccording to Articles 4(b) and 7 of the SMU, all exchanges of information between Canada and \nthe U.S. must only be made between officials designated in Appendix A.  \nInformation as well as inquiries and requests for information are shared pursuant to an express \nunderstanding of strict confidentiality. Therefore, other than as noted below, information as well \nas inquiries and requests for information are to be accorded protection from disclosure to third \nparties as provided under Canadian laws and Government of Canada policies. \nThe SMU provides for the further sharing of information with participants’ partner agencies within \neach country. \nCanadian participants do not require permission from the providing U.S. participant to share \ninformation with the agencies listed in Table 1, provided that the conditions listed below are met. \nU.S. participants do not require permission from the providing Canadian participant to share \ninformation with the agencies listed in Table 2 provided that the following conditions are met. \n \nConditions: \n1 \nthe laws and policies governing third-party-information-sharing permit the contemplated third-\nparty sharing; \n2 \nthe information is to be used for the administration and enforcement of citizenship and \nimmigration laws; \n3 \nthe receiving agency agrees not to use the information provided to them under this SMU for a \npurpose other than those set out in 5.1; and \n4 \nthe Canadian participant has provided notice to the receiving agency that it is prohibited from \nsharing the information further, without obtaining prior authorization from the providing \nparticipant.  \n \nTable 1: Agencies with whom CIC/the CBSA may share information  \n1. The following agencies and their successors \nCanadian Food Inspection Agency,  \nHealth Canada,  \nCanadian Security Intelligence Service,  \nFisheries and Oceans Canada, \nForeign Affairs and International Trade \nCanada,  \nCanadian Department of National Defence, \nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police. \n2. Other Canadian agencies \nStrictly in the performance of their citizenship, immigration or border management functions (e.g., the \nIRB). \n3. Canadian oversight and review agencies, including: \nPrivacy Commissioner of Canada \n     Auditor General of Canada \n \nTo share information with agencies not listed in Table 1, written permission from the providing \nU.S. participant is required prior to the sharing of information except in compelling circumstances,\nIN 2 Directives for Sharing Information Pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. \nStatement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing \n \n2014-01-17 \n7 \nin which case written notice must be provided to the U.S. participant as soon as possible \nthereafter.  \n \n \nTable 2: Agencies with whom U.S. participants may share information \n1. The following agencies and their successors \n \nU.S. Coast Guard \nU.S. Customs Service \nU.S. Department of Agriculture \n \n \nU.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation \nU.S. Central Intelligence Agency \nU.S. Department of Defence \n \nTo share information with agencies not listed in Table 2, written permission from the providing \nCanadian participant is required prior to the sharing of information, except in compelling \ncircumstances, in which case written notice must be provided to the Canadian participant as soon \nas possible thereafter. \nGiven the limitations on further information-sharing, designated officers may receive requests \nfrom U.S. designated officials for permission to share information, previously provided by \nCanada, to a third party or for a purpose where the information may be publicly disclosed such as \nin an open hearing, including criminal courts. \n \nIt is also possible that at the time of requesting information, the requestor knows that it will be \ndisclosed to a third party or that it will be used in a public hearing. In this case, the designated \nofficer may request permission to disclose the information at the same time as the request for \ninformation is being made. This way, the receiving officer does not have to make a second \nrequest to determine whether or not the information may be disclosed to a third party or in a \npublic forum. When giving permission in this case, the providing officer should ensure that the \nwritten permission specifies to whom it may be released and for what purpose. This will assist in \npreventing the information to be released to other parties or to be used for another purpose. \n \nWhenever a designated officer receives a request for permission to share information with a third \nparty or for disclosure in a public hearing, the receiving officer should ascertain precisely what \ninformation is to be shared, with whom it will be shared, and for what purpose. Specific questions \nabout the case, the law being administered or enforced, and in the case of a hearing, details \nabout the type of hearing should be asked.  \n \nTaking into consideration the responses to these questions, prior to providing permission to \nfurther share the information, the providing officer should consider if the SMU is the best vehicle \nfor allowing the release of information. For example, officers may be asked to provide written \npermission for Canadian information to be used in a U.S. court proceeding. Officers should ask \nfor detailed information about the type of the court proceeding, where the information will be \nused, and the type of charges that have been or may be laid. If the court proceeding is for a \ncitizenship or immigration-related hearing, the SMU may be the vehicle to release the information. \nHowever, if the nature of the court proceeding is, for example, criminal in nature and does not \nrelate to a citizenship or immigration purpose, the officer should advise their U.S. counterparts to \nobtain permission to use the information through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) that \nCanada has with the United States. Officers should also consider communicating with National \nHeadquarters in such cases.  \n \nIf the receiving officer decides that the information may be shared under the SMU, the officer \nmust ensure  that all the conditions noted in section 5.3 above are met prior to authorizing the \nrelease of the information. When assessing risk or harm under section 5.3, officers should be \naware that the risk associated with disclosure of the information increases if the information is \nused in the public domain. Any sharing of information that may involve public disclosure of that \ninformation (that is at a public hearing) should be approached with caution, particularly where \nsuch disclosures involve a refugee or a refugee claimant.\nIN 2 Directives for Sharing Information Pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. \nStatement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing \n \n2014-01-17 \n8 \nSingle Point of Contact  \nIn addition to established lines of communication between Canadian and U.S. field officers, there \nis also a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) at the respective National Headquarters for sharing \ninformation between Canada and the U.S. In the absence of a local contact, Canadian or U.S. \nofficers have the ability to approach the National Headquarters of the other party to request \ninformation on a case-by-case basis. In the majority of cases, the SPOC serves as a coordinator \nbetween the requesting participant and the providing participant. The SPOC for Canada resides \nin the CIC Refugees Branch, Asylum Division (see List of Designated Officials). The SPOC for \nthe U.S. is located in the DHS, Citizenship and Immigration Services.  \n5.7. \nSubsequent treatment of information \nTo prevent the unauthorized disclosure, copying, use, or modification of information provided \nunder the authority of this SMU, recipients are to restrict access to such information on a \nneed-to-know basis, and use recognized security mechanisms such as passwords, encryption, or \nother reasonable safeguards to prevent unauthorized access.   \nCanada’s laws and policies regarding the retention and disposal of information received pursuant \nto this SMU are applicable.  \n5.8. \nRecording the sharing of information \nWhen the designated officer receives a request from the U.S. that results in a match, all \ninformation exchanges must be documented on the subject’s file including the written request, \ninformation shared, the name of the requester, the date when the information was shared and the \ndesignated official’s badge/identification number. A Non-computer-based (NCB) remark must be \nentered into the Field Operations Support System (FOSS) to indicate that information has been \nprovided to or received from U.S. participants. \nWhen the designated officer receives a request from the U.S. that results in a “no match”, only an \nNCB must be entered into FOSS. \n \nFOSS NCB Codes:  \nEnter \nNCB 12 when there is a match. \nNCB 22 when there is no match. \nOfficers are not precluded from entering other NCBs for other purposes as required.  \nNote:  These are interim measures until GCMS implementation.  \n \n \n \nInterim measures until GCMS implementation  \n \n \n \nIn addition, until GCMS will be fully implemented, all exchanges of information will be \ndocumented on form IMM 5570 B. This form can be filled in by hand or electronically. Once \ncompleted, one copy will be attached to the written request for information, where available, and \nplaced on the client’s paper file. A second copy of the completed form will be placed on a central \nfile to be kept at each office processing such requests. The collective office file is required to \nensure that all incidences of information-shared will be readily located in the event of an access-\nto-information request or an audit by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner or the Auditor \nGeneral.  \n \nReasons why information provided must be tracked \nPrivacy Act \nSection 12 of the Privacy Act states that Canadian citizens and permanent residents have the \nright to access personal information held for administrative purposes. They also have the right to\nIN 2 Directives for Sharing Information Pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. \nStatement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing \n \n2014-01-17 \n9 \nrequest correction of the personal information where the individual believes there is an error, or to \nrequest that a notation be attached to the information reflecting any correction requested but not \nmade. Furthermore, the institution holding this information must advise any third party to whom \nthe information was disclosed that the information was corrected or that a request to have it \ncorrected was made. Refer to section 11 of the Privacy Regulations for additional details on these \nrequirements.   \nIf there is no record of the information that was disclosed, officers will not be able to notify parties \nto whom the information was disclosed that the information has been corrected or that a request \nto this effect has been made. \n \n \nReasons why information that is shared with the U.S. about persons other than Canadian \ncitizens and permanent residents must be tracked \nPrivacy Act \nUnder section 6(1) of the Privacy Act, personal information used by an institution for an \nadministrative purpose must be retained long enough to ensure that the individual to whom this \ninformation relates has a reasonable opportunity to request access to this information. By \nregulation this time period is two years. The sharing of information with the U.S. constitutes \n“administrative use” and as such it must be tracked so that if the individual to whom the \ninformation relates makes an access-to-information request, the fact that information was shared \nmay be made known to them, where this disclosure is not otherwise noted as an exemption in \nprovisions of the Privacy Act. \n \nA foreign national, not present in Canada, does not have the right to access their personal \ninformation pursuant to the Privacy Act. (This does not preclude an informal release if the officer \nis certain of the foreign national's identity). The individual, however, may authorize a \nrepresentative to act on his behalf by signing a consent to allow CIC to release the individual's \npersonal information to the chosen representative. Representatives can be Canadian Citizens,  \npermanent residents or even foreign nationals, as long as they are present in Canada.  \n \nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \nWhere an institution discloses personal information to a foreign government for a substantial or \nmaterial use and that information is later identified to be incorrect, the institution, in these \ncircumstances, has the duty, pursuant to the Charter, that is security of the person, to notify the \n\"SMU receiving party and its subsequent receiving parties\" to correct their records and to so \namend any incorrect administrative actions taken on the basis of the incorrect information \nprovided. \n \nFuture investigations \nIt is plausible that if, at some time in the future, CIC/CBSA actions are subject to an investigation, \nthe fact that they shared information with the U.S. on a particular individual may be significant. \nFor this reason also, it is necessary to track information shared. \n \n \n \nReasons why information received must be tracked \n \nPrivacy Act – Personal Information obtained in confidence \nSection 19 of the Privacy Act states that a government institution cannot disclose, without \nconsent of the information provider, personal information received in confidence from the \ngovernment of a foreign state.  \n \nIn order to comply with this requirement of the Privacy Act, it is necessary to know the origin of \nthe information. \n \nSMU on Information Sharing between Canada and the U.S. \nArticle 6 [Subsequent Uses and Treatment], paragraph c(i) states:\nIN 2 Directives for Sharing Information Pursuant to the 2003 Canada-U.S. \nStatement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing \n \n2014-01-17 \n10 \n“The participants are to obtain written permission for the disclosure to third parties of any \nconfidential information received pursuant to this SMU prior to such disclosure…” \nInformation received from the U.S. must be flagged so that officers will know that they are to seek \npermission from the U.S. prior to sharing this information further. \nArticle 10 [Procedure for Amending and Deleting Information] states: \n“. . . the receiving Participant bears the responsibility of checking the providing Participant’s \ninformation for subsequent updates.”   \nThis is because \n “Participants are to exercise due diligence to ensure any actions taken are based on the \nmost current information.” [Article 10 of the SMU]  \nInformation received from the U.S. must be tracked so that officers may go back and verify its \naccuracy if they wish to take action based on the information at a later date. \nArticle 12 [Resolution of Disputes] states: \n“A Participant who believes that information received under the SMU may have been \nimproperly used or disclosed is to immediately notify the providing Participant. . . .” \nIn order to notify the providing Participant, it is necessary to know who that Participant was. \nTherefore, a record of disclosure and receipt of information is required.   \n6. \nDefinitions  \nAnnexes \nThe Annexes address any additional requirements or provisions applicable to specific types \nof information-sharing to the extent that those provisions are different from, or not \ndescribed in, the SMU. Annexes will be added to the SMU as necessary. \nArrangement \nA non-legally binding statement of cooperation between two or more parties such as a \nmemorandum of understanding or statement of mutual understanding. \n \nCitizenship and \nimmigration \nlaws  \n \nLaws and regulations of Canada relating to admission, temporary entry, removal, \nnaturalization, denaturalization, or loss of nationality.
