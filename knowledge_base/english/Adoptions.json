It explains \n \nthe regulatory requirements for intercountry adoptions to be valid for immigration purposes; \n \nthe role of the provinces and territories in international adoptions; \n \nthe impact of the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation \nin Respect of Intercountry Adoption on immigration processing; and \n \nhow to process permanent residence applications in the case of intercountry adoptions and \norphaned relatives. \n1.1 Which immigration category this chapter affects \nThe policies and guidelines on intercountry adoptions in this chapter apply primarily to applications for \npermanent resident visas made in the family class category for adopted children, children to be adopted \nin Canada, and orphaned relatives. However, there may be information of interest to officers processing \napplications in other categories where the application involves dependent children that have been \nadopted. \n1.2 Where to find other related policies and guidelines \nTable 1: For information on related policies and guidelines, see the appropriate reference below. \nProcessing applications to sponsor members of the family class \nIP 2 \nProcessing permanent residence applications for members of the family class living outside \nCanada \nOP 2 \nGrant of Canadian citizenship for persons adopted by Canadian citizens on or after \nJanuary 1, 1947 \nCP 14 \n2 Program objectives \nThe intent of the family class program is to facilitate the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and \npermanent residents with their close relatives. In the case of intercountry adoptions, the intent is also to \nensure that the best interests of the child are protected. \n3 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and its \nRegulations \nProvision \nReference in the Act or its Regulations \nObjective relating to family reunification \nA3(1)(d)  \nSponsorship of a foreign national \nA13\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n7 \nRight to appeal a family class refusal \nA63(1)  \nDefinition of a dependent child \nR2  \nDefinition of the Hague Convention on Adoption \nR2  \nInterpretation of the term “adoption” \nR3(2) \nBad faith (adoptions of convenience) \nR4(2) \nR117(1)(g)(i) \nR117(2)(b) \nR117(4)(c) \nDefinition of a member of the family class \nR117(1)  \nDependent child (including adopted child) \nR117(1)(b)  \nOrphaned child \nR117(1)(f)  \nChild to be adopted in Canada \nR117(1)(g)  \nAdoption under 18 \nR117(2) \nR117(3) \nBest interests of the child \nR117(3)  \nAdoption over 18 \nR117(4)  \nProvincial statement \nR117(7)  \nNew evidence \nR117(8)  \nInformation on the medical condition of child \nR118  \nAdopted sponsor \nR133(5)  \n3.1 Forms required \nThe forms required are shown in the following table: \nForm title \nNumber \nApplication to Sponsor, Sponsorship Agreement and Undertaking \nIMM 1344 \nGeneric Application Form for Canada \nIMM 0008 \nMedical Report \nIMM 1017 \nMedical Condition Statement \n \n3.2 Fees \nEach sponsorship application for an adopted child must include the processing fees. For further \ninformation, refer to the fees and cost recovery instructions.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n8 \n4 Instruments and delegations \nSubsection A6(1) authorizes the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) to designate \nofficers to exercise certain powers and to delegate authorities. It also specifies which ministerial \nauthorities may not be delegated, specifically those relating to security certificates or national interest. \nPursuant to subsection A6(2), the Minister of CIC has delegated powers and designated those officials \nauthorized to carry out any purpose of any legislative or regulatory provisions of the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Act (IRPA) or its Regulations (IRPR) in chapter IL 3, Designation of Officers and \nDelegation of Authority. \n5 Departmental policy \n5.1 Intercountry adoption process: immigration and citizenship streams \nIntercountry adoption is a two-step process: the adoption process and the immigration or citizenship \nprocess. \nTwo streams are available for adoptive parents in order to obtain status in Canada for their adopted child: \nthe immigration process via the IRPA and IRPR, and the citizenship process via the Citizenship Act. \nThe immigration process may be used for dependent children who are under the age of 18 at the time of \nthe adoption [R117(2)], 18 years of age or over [R117(4)], or for children who are to be adopted in \nCanada [R117(1)(g)]. \nThe citizenship process allows Canadian adoptive parents to apply directly for Canadian citizenship for \ntheir adopted child. Additional details on the citizenship process can be found in chapter CP 14. \nThe criteria for granting citizenship to foreign-born adopted children of Canadian citizens under the \nCitizenship Act and its Regulations are similar to those for granting permanent resident status to adopted \nchildren under the IRPA and IRPR. Adoptive parents must choose the process that best corresponds to \ntheir situation. The main distinctions between the two are summarized in the following table: \n \nImmigration process \nCitizenship process \nWho can apply? \nAn adoptive parent who is a Canadian \ncitizen, a permanent resident who \nresides in Canada or a Canadian citizen \nwho intends to reside in Canada once \nthe immigration process is complete \nAn adoptive parent who is a Canadian \ncitizen born or naturalized in Canada at \nthe time of the adoption \nChild’s status at the \nend of the process \nPermanent resident \nCanadian citizen \nForeign citizenship \nThe adopted person does not lose their \nforeign citizenship once they become a \nIn some countries, the adopted person \ncould lose their foreign citizenship once\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n9 \npermanent resident of Canada. \nthey become a Canadian citizen. \nFirst generation limit The first generation limit does not apply \nto the adopted person’s children if the \nchildren are born outside of Canada. \nThe first generation limit does apply to \nthe adopted person’s children if the \nchildren are born outside of Canada. \n5.2 Provincial and federal adoption authorities \nIn Canada, provinces and territories are responsible for adoption and child welfare. Provincial and \nterritorial legislation and procedures protect the rights and welfare of children. \nThe provincial and territorial jurisdiction is reflected in the IRPR, which requires that the child welfare \nauthority of the province or territory to which the child is destined provide a written statement that they do \nnot object to the adoption. A written statement to this effect is required in all cases where provincial or \nterritorial jurisdiction applies. Provinces and territories require a home study of the prospective adoptive \nparents before approving intercountry adoptions. \nThe Intercountry Adoption Services (IAS), a unit within CIC, is Canada’s federal central adoption authority \nunder the Hague Convention. The IAS is responsible for intercountry adoption matters at the national and \ninternational levels and works directly with provinces and territories to provide information and guidance. \nHowever, provinces and territories make the decisions regarding eligibility and assist Canadians in their \nefforts to adopt. IAS’s role in intercountry adoption includes \n \nfacilitating communication and cooperation between adoption authorities at the federal, provincial \nor territorial, and international levels; \n \nfacilitating issue resolution and developing pan-Canadian responses on matters such as unethical \nand irregular adoption practices; \n \nadvising on or developing legislation, regulations, policies, procedures, standards and guidelines \nrelated to intercountry adoption; and \n \ncollecting and disseminating information specific to intercountry adoption (adoption legislation, \npolicies and practices of countries of origin, statistical data and research). \nInformation on the responsible central adoption authorities in the provinces and territories can be found \non the CIC website. See Appendix A for information on province-specific legislation. \n5.3 Canada’s international commitments on adoptions \n5.3.1 Hague Convention \nSee also section 6, Definitions, and section 7, Procedure. \nOn December 19, 1996, Canada ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and \nCooperation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption (hereinafter referred to as the Hague Convention).\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n10 \nGiven that adoption is a provincial or territorial responsibility, Canada extended the application of the \nHague Convention to the Canadian provinces and territories progressively, once each jurisdiction had \nenacted implementing legislation and established a central adoption authority. Since February 2006, the \nHague Convention applies across Canada. \nProvincial and territorial laws give effect to the Hague Convention. \nIn Canada, immigration and citizenship legislation has been amended to support Canada’s obligations \nunder the Hague Convention and is reflected in the IRPR. \nThe main principles of the Hague Convention are to \n \nestablish safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the \nchild and with respect for their fundamental rights; \n \nestablish a system of cooperation between contracting states to ensure that those safeguards are \nrespected, thus preventing the abduction, sale of or traffic in children; and \n \nsecure the recognition in contracting states of adoptions made in accordance with the Hague \nConvention. \nThe Hague Convention covers only adoptions that create a permanent parent-child relationship. The \nHague Convention applies where a child habitually resident in one Contracting State (the State of origin) \nhas been, is being, or is to be moved to another Contracting State (the receiving State, Canada) either \nafter their adoption in the State of origin by spouses or a person habitually resident in the receiving State \n(Canada), or for the purposes of such an adoption in the receiving State (Canada) or in the State of \norigin. If neither condition is met, the Hague Convention does not apply. However, it is generally accepted \nthat States Party to the Hague Convention should extend the application of its principles to non-Hague \nConvention adoptions. For the current list of countries and their status in regards to the Hague \nConvention, refer to the Hague Conference on Private International Law website. \nNote: The country where the child habitually resides, not the country of the child’s nationality, determines \nwhether the Hague Convention applies. \nUnder the Hague Convention, countries designate a central adoption authority that administers \nintercountry adoptions in a manner consistent with its provisions. In the case of Canada, the provinces \nand territories have been designated as such authorities with case management responsibilities. The \nfederal central adoption authority’s role is to facilitate communication and cooperation between Canadian \ncentral adoption authorities in the provinces and territories and those of foreign governments. The central \nadoption authorities of the provinces and territories must determine whether the Hague Convention \napplies to a particular case. \nThe Hague Convention requires the central adoption authority in the country where the adoption is taking \nplace (sending country) to ensure that \n \nthe child is legally free for adoption; \n \ninstitutions and authorities whose consent is necessary for adoption have given their consent \nfreely, in the required legal form and expressed in writing;\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n11 \n \nthe birth parents have consented to the adoption and understand the consequences for their \nparental rights; \n \nthe decision to place a child for adoption is not motivated by financial gain; and \n \nthe child’s consent to the adoption, where such consent is required, has been given freely, in the \nrequired legal form and expressed or evidenced in writing. \nIn addition, the Hague Convention requires the central adoption authority in the adoptive parents’ country \nof residence (receiving country) to ensure that \n \nthe adoptive parents are eligible and suitable to adopt; and \n \nthe appropriate authorities have decided that the child is allowed to enter and live permanently in \nthe receiving country. \nIn a Hague Convention case, an adoption may be finalized only after the sending and receiving countries \nhave verified the above information. The Hague Convention allows for the adoption to be undertaken in \neither the state of origin or the receiving state. \nSee section 7.1 for procedures to be followed in Hague Convention cases. Appendix E provides the \ncomplete process for Hague Convention cases, including the roles of Canadian and foreign central \nadoption authorities. \nFor the full text of the Hague Convention, refer to the Hague Conference on Private International Law \nwebsite. \n5.3.2 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child \nCanada is also party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). With respect to \nadoptions, article 21 of the CRC affirms that “States Parties that recognize and/or permit the system of \nadoption shall ensure that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration”. \nThe Hague Convention gives effect to article 21 of the CRC by adding substantive safeguards and \nprocedures to the broad principles and standards laid out in the CRC. Additionally, Canada’s \ncommitments as a party to the CRC exist regardless of whether the child in an intercountry adoption \nresides in a country that has implemented the CRC. \nThe IRPR promote consistency in assessing the best interests of children, maintaining Canada’s \ncommitments as signatory to both the Hague Convention and the CRC.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n12 \n5.4 Regulatory requirements for adoptions to be valid for immigration \npurposes \nRequirement \nAdoption — \nunder 18 \n[R117(2)] \n[R117(3)] \nTo be \nadopted \n[R117(1)(g)] \nAdoption — \nover 18 \n[R117(4)] \nReferences in \nOP 3 \nRegulation \nFull adoption \nYes \nNo \nYes \nsection 6 \nR3(2) \nHome study \nYes \nNo1 \nNo \nsection 5.5 \nsection 7.5 \nR117(3)(a) \nFree and informed \nconsent of \nbiological parents \nYes \nNo22 \nNo \nsection 5.16 \nR117(3)(b) \nGenuine parent-\nchild relationship \n(In the case of an \nadoption over 18: \nbefore the child \nturned 18 and at \nthe time of \nadoption) \nYes \nNo \nYes \nsection 5.10 \nR117(3)(c) \nR117(4)(b) \nAdoption in \naccordance with \nthe laws of the \nplace where the \nadoption took \nplace \nYes \nNo \nYes \nsection 5.8 \nR117(3)(d) \nR117(4)(a) \nAdoption in \naccordance with \nlaws of country of \nresidence of \nadoptive parents \nYes \nNo \nYes \nsection 5.12 \nR117(3)(e) \nR117(4)(a) \nNotification in \nwriting from the \nYes \nYes \nNo \nsection 5.6 \nR117(1)(g)(iii)(B) \n                                           \n \n1 Although not an IRPR requirement, a home study is usually required by provincial and territorial central adoption \nauthorities for adoptions to be completed in Canada. See section 5.5 for more information. \n2 Although consent of biological parents is not an explicit IRPR requirement for adoptions to be completed in Canada, \nit is a requirement of the Hague Convention. Consent is also required for a child to be legally available for adoption in \nnon-Hague Convention cases for adoption of a child in Canada.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n13 \nprovince or \nterritory where the \nadoptive parents \nreside that the \nchild is authorized \nto enter and \nreside \npermanently in \nthe province or \nterritory (non-\nHague \nConvention \ncountries) \nR117(3)(e) \nNotification in \nwriting that the \ncountry where the \nadoption took \nplace and the \nprovince or \nterritory of the \nadopted person’s \nintended \nresidence \napprove the \nadoption as \nconforming to the \nHague \nConvention \n(Hague \nConvention \ncountries) \nYes \nYes \nNo \nsection 5.6 \nR117(1)(g)(ii) \nR117(3)(f) \nMeet \nrequirements or \nspirit of Hague \nConvention \nYes \nYes \nNo \nsection 5.13 \nsection 6 \nA3(3)(f) \nR117(1)(g)(ii) \nR117(1)(g)(iii)(A) \nR117(3)(f) \nR117(3)(g) \nNo evidence of \nundue gain or \nchild trafficking \nYes \nYes \nNo \nsection 5.13 \nR117(1)(g)(iii)(A) \nR117(3)(g) \nAdoption not \nentered into \nprimarily for the \npurpose of \nYes \nYes \nYes \nsection 5.9 \nsection 7.9 \nR117(1)(g)(i) \nR117(2)(b)\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n14 \nacquiring a status \nor privilege (not \nan adoption of \nconvenience) \nsection 7.17 \nR117(4)(c) \nR4(2) \nChild placed for \nadoption or \notherwise legally \navailable for \nadoption \nNo \nYes (in non-\nHague \nConvention \ncases) \nNo \nsection 7.3 \nR117(1)(g)(iii)(A) \nAdoptive parents \nhave signed a \nstatement stating \nthat they have \ninformation on the \nchild’s medical \ncondition \nYes \nYes \nNo \nsection 5.15 \nsection 7.8 \nR118 \n5.5 Home study conducted by a competent authority \nAn assessment of prospective adoptive parents with respect to their suitability to adopt is undertaken by \nthe provincial or territorial central adoption authority as a pre-condition to an adoption. \nFor immigration purposes, the IRPR require that, in the case of an adoption completed outside of \nCanada, a home study be conducted [R117(3)(a)] by a competent authority. In Canada, competent \nauthorities include provincial and territorial authorities and individuals authorized by those authorities, \nsuch as accredited social workers. A letter of no objection or a notice of agreement from the province or \nterritory approving the intercountry adoption confirms that an acceptable home study has been \ncompleted. See section 7.5 for case processing centre procedures to request the letter of no objection. \nThe IRPR do not require a home study in cases where the child is to be adopted in Canada. On the other \nhand, the Hague Convention requires that central adoption authorities in the receiving State ensure that \nadoptive parents are eligible and suitable to adopt. Provincial and territorial central adoption authorities \nnormally require a home study for adoptions completed either in the State of origin or in their province or \nterritory and confirm in their letter of no objection or notice of agreement that a home study has been \ncompleted. \nA home study may not be required by the provincial or territorial central adoption authorities if they have \nno jurisdiction. Provinces and territories may have no jurisdiction in the following instances: cases where \nthe adoptive parents are not habitual residents of a province or territory at the time of completion of the \nadoption, cases where the child to be adopted is over 18 years old, and cases of relative adoption (see \nsection 5.23 and Appendix A). \nIf a letter of no objection has not been provided by the province or territory and an officer does not have \nevidence that a home study was conducted, the officer should\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n15 \n \nask the sponsor to provide proof that a home study has been conducted by an accredited social \nworker in the province or territory of residence of the parents (provincial or territorial central \nadoption authorities can provide a list of accredited social workers); \n \nask the sponsor to provide proof that a home study was conducted and approved by the local \nchild welfare authority or an accredited social worker in the country of residence of the parents if \nthey reside outside of Canada and the adoption occurred outside of Canada (if it is clear that a \nhome study was not conducted, the officer may request that the sponsor obtain one from a \ncompetent authority or accredited social worker in the place of residence of the adoptive parents); \nand \n \nrefer the sponsor to an International Social Service (ISS) in the country of residence of the \nparents if no such service is available in the sending state and arrange for a home study to be \nconducted to determine the suitability of the adoptive parents. \n5.6 Provincial notification letters \nThe following table describes the types of provincial notification letters: \nType of letter Description \nLetter (or \nnotice) of \nagreement \nIn Hague Convention cases, the concerned provincial or territorial central adoption \nauthority forwards a letter (or notice) of agreement to the visa office and a copy to the \ncentral adoption authority of the applicant’s country of residence indicating that the \nprovince or territory and the prospective adoptive parents agree to the adoption. This \nnotification establishes that the adoption conforms to the Hague Convention and fulfils \nthe requirements of subparagraph R117(1)(g)(ii) or paragraph R117(3)(f). \nLetter of no \nobjection \nWhere the Hague Convention does not apply and the adoptive parents reside in a \nprovince or territory at the time of the adoption, the central adoption authority of that \nprovince or territory is asked for a letter of no objection (confirming that they do not object \nto the adoption). The letter of no objection indicates that the provincial or territorial \nauthority agrees to the adoption and that all their requirements have been met. This letter \nis commonly called a letter of no objection and is conclusive evidence as per the IRPR. \nClause R117(1)(g)(iii)(B) and paragraph R117(3)(e) require that the central adoption \nauthority in the province or territory of destination state in writing that they have no \nobjection to the adoption. \nWith respect to adopted children, the requirement for a letter of no objection applies only \nto children adopted abroad by sponsors residing in Canada. If a sponsor resides abroad \nand an adoption takes place abroad, provincial and territorial central adoption authorities \ndo not normally provide a letter of no objection, as these adoptions are not intercountry \nadoptions. \nLetter of no \ninvolvement \nProvincial or territorial central adoption authorities occasionally provide a letter of no \ninvolvement in cases where a sponsorship application is submitted for an adopted child \nbut the province or territory has no jurisdiction. For instance, this may occur in cases \nwhere the adoption was finalized abroad while the adoptive parents resided outside of \nCanada or in cases of relative adoptions. A letter of no involvement may indicate that\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n16 \nsome of the requirements have been met and/or may signal that the province or territory \nis aware of the adoption and that, if the child is granted permanent resident status, the \nadoption will be recognized in the province or territory once the child arrives in Canada. \nLetters stating that the province or territory is not involved with the adoption do not meet \nany requirements set out in section R117. The letter of no involvement cannot be equated \nto the approval or letter of no objection from the competent central adoption authority. \n5.7 Provincial or territorial letter of agreement or letter of no objection \nAs per subsection R117(7), a letter of agreement or a letter of no objection to an adoption issued by a \nprovincial or territorial central adoption authority is to be accepted by a visa officer as conclusive evidence \nthat the requirements under clause R117(1)(g)(iii)(A) for a child to be adopted in Canada or under \nparagraphs R117(3)(a) to (e), and (g) for an adopted child have been met. \nAfter the written statement (a letter of agreement or a letter of no objection to an adoption) by the central \nadoption authority is provided to the officer, if the officer receives evidence that the requirements listed \nbelow (the list is not exhaustive) have not been met, the processing of the application shall be suspended \nuntil the officer provides that evidence to the competent authority of the province or territory and that \nauthority confirms or revises its written statement (see subsection R117(8) for more details). If the \nprovince or territory confirms that the letter of agreement or letter of no objection is still valid, the officer \nmust determine whether to issue a visa or refuse the case. \n \nthe child was not legally available for adoption; \n \nthe parents did not give their free and informed consent to the adoption; \n \nthe adoption is for the purpose of child trafficking or undue gain within the meaning of the Hague \nConvention; \n \nthe adoption did not create a genuine parent-child relationship; or \n \nthe adoption was not in accordance with the laws of the place where the adoption took place. \nThe letter of agreement or letter of no objection does not indicate whether the adoption is primarily for the \npurpose of obtaining status or privilege under the IRPA. A visa officer is responsible for making this \ndetermination under subparagraph R117(1)(g)(i), paragraph R117(2)(b), or paragraph R117(4)(c). \n5.8 Laws of the place where the adoption took place \nEach country has its own requirements and procedures for intercountry adoptions. In general, unless \nthere is some information to the contrary, the submission of a valid adoption order issued by the \ncompetent authority is satisfactory evidence that the applicable foreign legal adoption requirements have \nbeen met [R117(3)(d)]. The letter of no objection from the province or territory is, as stated in section 5.7, \nconclusive evidence that the requirements of paragraph R117(3)(d) have been met. \nOfficers should be particularly vigilant in assessing adoptions where \n \nregistration of the adoption order is not a legal requirement; \n \nthe requirements of adoption laws are not strictly followed; and\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n17 \n \nthe country does not authorize international adoptions. \nIn any of these circumstances, an officer should carefully consider whether the adoption fully complies \nwith the laws of the country where it took place and creates a genuine parent-child relationship and \nshould communicate any concerns to the provincial or territorial central adoption authority (see \nsection 5.10 for more details). \nAdoptions legally recognized where they occur are recognized in all provinces and territories of Canada \nexcept Quebec. In Quebec, tribunals must grant recognition after the child arrives in Canada (see \nAppendix A for more details). This process does not have any impact on immigration processing. \nAn application may be refused if an adoption does not comply with the laws of the country where it \noccurred, and as a result, a letter of no objection from a province or territory is not issued. In such cases, \nthe child is not adopted and is not a member of the family class. \n5.9 Adoptions of convenience \nThis content has been moved as part of the Department’s efforts to modernize operational guidance to \nstaff. It can now be found in the Program Integrity section. \n5.10 Genuine parent-child relationship \nIn the case of the adoption of a minor child, paragraph R117(3)(c) requires that an adoption create a \ngenuine parent-child relationship. In order to meet this criterion, an adoption order must create a genuine \nparent-child relationship both in law and in fact. \nAs per subsection R117(7), the letter of agreement or the letter of no objection from the provincial or \nterritorial central adoption authority must be taken as conclusive evidence that this requirement is met. \nIn the case of an adult adoption, paragraph R117(4)(b) requires that a genuine parent-child relationship \nhave existed at the time of the adoption and existed before the child reached the age of 18. \nTo assess whether an adoption has created a genuine parent-child relationship, officers should look \nclosely at the effects of the adoption to determine \n \nwhether the adoption completely severs the adopted child’s former legal ties with their biological \nparents and creates a new legal parent-child relationship; \n \nthe authenticity of the parent-child relationship, the establishment of which is the primary purpose \nof an adoption (an adoption must not be a means for a child to gain admission to Canada); and \n \nwhether the adoption is in accordance with the laws of the place where the adoption took place \nand the laws of the place of residence of the adoptive parents (see section 5.8 and section 5.12 \nfor more information). \nAn assessment of the severing of pre-existing legal parent-child ties applies only where there are living \nparents with whom the child has a legal parent-child relationship at the time the adoption takes place.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n18 \nThis requirement is not relevant in cases of orphaned or abandoned children, where there is no \npre-existing parent-child relationship. \n5.11 Best interests of the child \nThe term “best interests of the child” is a concept found in many legal instruments that deal with children’s \nissues, such as the Hague Convention and the Canada Divorce Act. The Hague Convention contains \ncertain rules to ensure that adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and with respect for their \nfundamental rights. These rules include the principle of subsidiary (consider solutions in the country of \norigin first), making sure the child is adoptable, thoroughly evaluating the prospective adoptive parents, \nand matching the child with a suitable family. \nThe IRPR require that provincial and territorial central adoption authorities, and in the case of a child who \nresides in a country that is a party to the Hague Convention, the central adoption authority of that country \neach provide documentary evidence to satisfy a visa officer that the adoption is in the best interests of the \nchild. This requirement is satisfied by a letter of no objection issued by the provincial or territorial child \nwelfare authority. The letter of no objection is conclusive evidence that the requirements set out in \nsubsection R117(3) have been met in order for the adoption to be considered to be in the best interests of \nthe child. \n5.12 Laws of the place of residence of the prospective adoptive parents \nParagraph R117(3)(e) requires that adoptions conform to the laws of the place of residence of the \nprospective adoptive parents. \nAs a starting point, officers must determine the prospective adoptive parents’ place of residence. In the \nmajority of cases, it is a province or territory in Canada. When it is not clear that the adoptive parents’ \ncountry of residence is Canada, officers must determine residency based on an assessment of all the \ncircumstances of the case. The following factors should be taken into consideration: \n \nwhether it can be said that a particular country of residence is the place where the prospective \nadoptive parents regularly, normally or customarily reside; and \n \nwhether a particular country of residence is the country in which the prospective adoptive parents \nhave centralized their mode of existence. \nParents reside in Canada \nWhen the prospective adoptive parents reside in Canada, the adoption must comply with the applicable \nadoption laws of the province or territory. Evidence that the adoption complies with the adoption laws of \nthe province or territory in which the prospective adoptive parents reside or intend to reside is stated in \nwriting in a provincial or territorial notification letter (see section 5.6 for more details). Provincial and \nterritorial central adoption authorities are involved only if the adoptive parents reside in Canada when the \nadoption takes place. \nSee Appendix A for information on adoption legislation in specific provinces and territories.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n19 \nParents reside outside Canada \nWhen the prospective adoptive parents are not habitual residents of Canada, the regulatory requirements \nto issue a permanent resident visa under the family class for an adopted child, a child to be adopted in \nCanada or an adopted adult must still be met. The provincial or territorial central adoption authorities in \nCanada do not have jurisdiction and do not provide a letter of no objection. \nA person who wishes to sponsor a member of the family class is required to reside in Canada, as per \nparagraph R130(1)(b). A Canadian adoptive parent who resides abroad and has adopted a child outside \nCanada may be exempt from the requirement to reside in Canada, according to subsection R130(2), if \nthey satisfy immigration officials that they will reside in Canada once their adopted child becomes a \npermanent resident in Canada. This exemption does not apply to sponsors who are permanent residents, \nas they are required to reside in Canada to be eligible to sponsor. This exception applies to adopted \nchildren who meet the definition of a dependent child under section R2. A sponsor of a child intended to \nbe adopted in Canada does not qualify for the exceptions in subsection R130(2), as the child does not \nmeet the definition of a dependent child. \n5.13 Child trafficking and undue gain \nChild trafficking and undue gain contravene the laws of most countries. All adoptions should be \nundertaken in accordance with the intent and spirit of the Hague Convention, even if an adoption is from a \ncountry that has not ratified the Convention. If an officer has evidence that child trafficking has taken \nplace or that there was undue gain in the process (a child was sold or improper financial gain took place), \nthe officer should refuse the case on the basis that the requirements were not met according to the spirit \nand intent of the Hague Convention (see subparagraph R117(1)(g)(ii), clause R117(1)(g)(iii)(A) and \nparagraphs R117(3)(f) and (g) for more information). \nAdditionally, the officer should inform the appropriate local authorities of the criminal activities (if \napplicable) and advise the following Canadian authorities: \n \nthe Canadian central authority for child abduction via the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade \nand Development; \n \nOur Missing Children via the Canada Border Services Agency; and \n \nthe provincial or territorial child welfare authority (if the child is in Canada). \n5.14 Suspension or closure of intercountry adoptions by a province or \nterritory \nIn certain circumstances, suspensions or closures of intercountry adoption programs with a country may \nbe the only solution to protect children and their families and to stop unethical or irregular activities in that \ncountry. Of primary concern are situations of child abduction and trafficking, the removal of children from \ntheir families without proper parental consent, and situations where prospects for improvement in the \ncountry in the absence of international pressure appear remote.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n20 \nAs provinces and territories have jurisdiction over adoption, CIC, through its Intercountry Adoption \nServices, works with the provincial and territorial central adoption authorities to reach a pan-Canadian \ndecision to impose a suspension or closure of intercountry adoption activity with a given country. \nHowever, provinces and territories can individually close adoptions from certain countries without the \nconsent of the other provinces and territories. \nCIC works with provinces and territories to consider the lifting of a suspension when there is sufficient \nevidence of reform and safeguards to protect the best interests of children in the country. \nWhen a suspension or closure is imposed on adoptions from a specific country, provincial and territorial \nauthorities decline to issue letters required by the IRPR for approval of a case. These cases should be \nrefused on the basis of non-approval of the province or territory. \nIn cases where provincial and territorial jurisdiction does not apply (e.g., adoptive parents do not reside in \na Canadian province or territory at the time of the adoption and have undertaken a domestic adoption \nabroad), the adoption must be carefully scrutinized to ensure all regulatory requirements are met and the \nbest interests of the child are protected. \nThe list of countries on which a suspension or closure is imposed is available on the CIC website. \n5.15 Parents fully and reliably informed about all aspects of a child’s \nmedical condition \nSection R118 requires that adoptive parents provide a written statement to the visa office confirming that \nthey have obtained information regarding the child’s medical condition. Adoptions have failed and even \nresulted in child abandonment when the prospective family was not equipped to deal with a particular \nmedical condition or was misinformed. \nSee section 7.8 for procedures. \n5.16 Consent of the biological parents \nIn all cases of adoption, the genuine and informed consent of the biological parents (where applicable) \nmust be provided [R117(3)(b)]. As per subsection R117(7), the letter of no objection is conclusive \nevidence that this requirement has been met. \nIf both parents are alive, both should give consent. In the event that only one parent gives consent to an \nadoption, the officer must be satisfied that the second parent has no legal rights with respect to the child. \nIn foreign jurisdictions where some adoption laws lack clarity about the full and permanent severing of ties \nand where the cultural milieu embraces the sharing of parental responsibilities, it is particularly important \nto ensure that biological parents fully comprehend that the adoption of a child by Canadian parents is \nviewed by Canadian law as fully and permanently severing pre-existing parental ties.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n21 \n5.17 Biological parents cannot be sponsored \nA full adoption severs a child’s legal relationship to their birth parents [R3(2)]. An adopted child cannot \nlater sponsor a birth parent. A full adoption also has the effect of severing ties to other members of the \nbiological family (brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, etc.). \nIn the case of an adoption by a step-parent to jointly become the parent of the child of their spouse or \npartner, the relationship between the child and the remaining biological or legal parent does not have to \nbe severed. \nOfficers at the case processing centre should try to verify that sponsors submitting an IMM 1344 form for \nrelatives are not in this situation. \nIf an officer has doubts about a specific case, they should check for an immigration file for the sponsor. \nOfficers should inform the case processing centre if a child who was adopted outside of Canada has \nsponsored a birth parent. Case processing centre staff should tell the sponsors they are ineligible, as the \nbiological family members of an adopted person do not qualify as members of the family class. \n5.18 Revocation of an adoption \nForeign and Canadian central adoption authorities may revoke foreign adoptions. An adoption revocation \nis a court decree that voids the adoption order. After the adoption is revoked, the child assumes the \nstatus they had prior to the adoption proceedings. If it is evident that revocation occurred in order to \nfacilitate sponsorship, the sponsor is not eligible [R133(5)]. \nDuring the assessment of the sponsor’s eligibility for a family class application, the case processing \ncentre may become aware that the sponsor was previously adopted. In order for the case processing \ncentre to assess whether the sponsor is eligible to sponsor their biological family members, the sponsor \nmust provide a copy of the court decree revoking the adoption. \nIf an officer is satisfied that revocation was not undertaken in order to facilitate the sponsorship of a \nbiological family member under the family class, the sponsorship may proceed. If a visa officer believes \nthat the reason for revocation was to allow sponsorship of a biological family member under the family \nclass, the officer should request additional information and, if necessary, conduct investigations or \ninterviews, as required, to determine whether it was a revocation of convenience. In some jurisdictions, \nan adoption cannot be revoked. It is necessary to check with the visa office responsible for the country in \nwhich the adoption took place to determine whether revocation is possible. \n5.19 Guardianship \nThe current IRPR do not include guardianship arrangements under the family class. Legal guardians \ncannot sponsor children under their guardianship as adopted children (see section 6 for more \ninformation).\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n22 \nIn some foreign jurisdictions, the system of guardianship in place neither terminates the birth parent-child \nrelationship nor grants full parental rights to the guardian. If the laws of the jurisdiction where the child \nresides do not allow for a legal adoption to take place, a letter of no objection from the provincial or \nterritorial central adoption authority may not be issued, and the provisions under the IRPR for either an \nadopted child or a child to be adopted in Canada may not be met. \nHowever, the laws of some countries that have a guardianship system in place and that do not permit \nadoptions in their jurisdiction may allow for children to be legally available to be adopted in Canada. In \nthis situation, it may be possible for Canadians and permanent residents to sponsor children to be \nadopted in Canada. \n5.20 Orphaned relatives \nOrphaned relatives may be sponsored, provided that they are under 18 years of age, unmarried, not in a \ncommon-law relationship and the sponsor’s brother, sister, nephew, niece, or grandchild [R117(1)(f)]. \nIn all cases of orphaned relatives, officers must request written consent of the appropriate authorities in \nthe child’s country of residence before the child may be removed from that country. Written consent of \nany legal guardians must also be obtained. \nSponsors residing in Quebec must contact the office of the Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Diversité et \nde l’Inclusion (MIDI) for sponsorship requirements in Quebec. The MIDI may approve “engagements” for \norphans on receipt of a positive recommendation from a representative from Centre Jeunesse, who \nconducts a home study before making the recommendation. \nWhen an application is received from an orphaned relative, the visa office must \n \nverify that the child is an orphan, is under 18 years of age on the date that the Case Processing \nCentre in Mississauga (CPC-M) receives the IMM 1344 form with the correct and complete \nprocessing fees, is not a spouse or common-law partner, and is related to the sponsor, as set out \nin paragraph R117(1)(f); and \n \nissue medical instructions. \nNote: The question of guardianship arises in the case of young foreign nationals who are not \naccompanied or are not destined to a legal guardian. For the child’s protection and well-being, officers \nmust request written consent from the appropriate authorities in the child’s country of residence before \nthe child may be removed from that country and should counsel sponsors to obtain legal guardianship of \nthe child on the child’s arrival in the province or territory of residence. \nThis ensures that the sponsor has legal obligations towards the sponsored child. \n5.21 Sponsorships of unnamed children \nSome adopting parents may not have the full name and date of birth of the child to be adopted at the time \nof application. In this situation, adopting parents should follow the instructions for sponsorship of children \nwho are not yet identified in Appendix A of the sponsor’s guide [IMM 5196] and complete the\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n23 \nIMM 0008 form with as much information as possible. In cases where the name of the child is unknown, \nadopting parents are asked to leave the name field blank. \nThe CPC-M treats applications to sponsor unnamed children the same way as it does those for named \nchildren. \nOfficers are encouraged to create unnamed children applications in the Global Case Management \nSystem (GCMS) by using the information included in the IMM 0008 form received with the sponsorship \napplication, as follows: \nFamily name: \nthe sponsor or adopting parents’ last name(s) \nName(s): \nblank, “baby”, or “child” \nDate of birth: \n**asterisks** \nGender: \nunknown \nIt is the sponsor’s responsibility to notify the appropriate visa office once the child is identified. Visa \nofficers will proceed to update the name of the child in the application originally created in GCMS. \n5.22 Processing priorities \nSponsorship applications for an adopted child or child to be adopted, including orphaned relatives, are \nprocessed based on priority by the CPC-M and visa offices. \nWith respect to processing priorities, visa offices should be mindful that cases involving adoption may \ninvolve minors who have been abandoned and placed with child welfare authorities, and as a result, are \nwithout parental care. Priority should be given to such cases. \n5.23 Relative adoptions \nWhere the adopted child is related to the adoptive parents, the pre-existing legal parent-child relationship \nshould be severed under the law. While the biological parent should no longer be acting as a parent after \nthe adoption has taken place, an ongoing relationship and contact with the biological parent and extended \nfamily may still occur. However, the new parent-child relationship between the adopted child and adoptive \nparents should be evident and not simply exist in law. Moreover, evidence that the biological parents fully \ncomprehend the effects of a full adoption and that they have provided their consent to the adoption \nshould also support a determination that the requirements of the IRPA and IRPR have been met. A home \nstudy may not be a requirement for relative adoptions in all provinces and territories. \nWhen relative adoptions are completed in Canada through a provincial or territorial court, the \ncorresponding central adoption authority is not involved and issues a letter of no involvement. A home \nstudy may not be a requirement for domestic relative adoptions in certain provinces and territories. The \nadoption order may be used as evidence that the adoption was in accordance with the laws of the \nprovince or territory where it took place. \n5.24 Adult adoptions\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n24 \nSubsection R117(4) provides for sponsorship of an adopted child of 18 years of age or older. In such \ncases, the following requirements must be met: \n \nthe adoption must be in accordance with the laws of the location where it takes place; if the \nsponsor resides in Canada at the time of the adoption, the adoption must be in accordance with \nthe laws of the province or territory in which the sponsor resides; \n \na genuine parent-child relationship must have been established before the applicant turned \n18 years of age and must continue to exist; \n \nthe adoption must not have been undertaken primarily to gain status or privilege in Canada under \nthe IRPA. \nNote: Some provinces and territories do not have laws regarding adult adoption. \nIn order to be considered a member of the family class under subsection R117(1), a foreign national \nwhose adoption takes place when the child is 18 years of age or older must also satisfy the definition of a \ndependent child in section R2 (see section 6 for more details). \nAn example of an adult adoption is when an individual is adopted as a foster child by their foster parent(s) \nafter the individual turns 18 years of age. \nApplicants may be requested to provide additional evidence to prove that there was a parent-child \nrelationship before the applicant turned 18 years of age and at the time the applicant was adopted. \n5.25 Humanitarian and compassionate considerations \nIn exceptional cases where the applicant does not meet all requirements of the IRPA and IRPR, the \napplicant may be exempt from these requirements based on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) \nconsiderations, which take into account the best interests of the child. Section A25 requires officers and \ndelegated authorities to examine H&C factors on the applicant’s request. In addition, if an officer believes \nthere are strong H&C factors present in a case, the officer may, on their own initiative and without the \napplicant having specifically requested it, put the case forward to the appropriate delegated authority to \napprove the application of subsection A25(1). For further information, refer to the program delivery \ninstructions on H&C considerations. \n5.26 Surrogacy cases with no genetic or biological link to either \nprospective parent \nA child born through surrogacy arrangements undertaken by Canadian intending parents who, following a \nDNA test or disclosure by the intending parents, has been found to have no genetic or biological link to \nthe intending parents, may be adopted by them. The parents may choose to pursue either a citizenship or \nimmigration adoption. In some countries, the surrogacy laws require that the intending parents be named \non the birth certificate. In these instances, the child cannot be sponsored as they are not eligible for \nadoption. \nA birth certificate presented in a surrogacy case may show the contracting parents as the birth parents; \nthis is only evidence that the registration of the child’s birth was made in the names of the contracting\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n25 \nparents, not that there is any legal, genetic or biological relationship. There may also be a declaration \nfrom the birth mother surrendering all rights to the child in favour of the contracting parents. This is only \nvalid as a contractual arrangement between those parties; it does not establish that the contracting \nparents have legal custody of the child or authority to remove the child from the country of origin. \nParents who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents may not be entitled to exclusive custody of the \nchild and may not have the authority to remove the child from the country of origin until a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction has granted them that custody and that authority. In cases where there is no \ngenetic or biological link to the Canadian intending parents, the contracting parents should adopt the child \nby following the standard procedures for international adoption: obtaining sponsorship, a home study, and \na provincial or territorial no objection letter. \nIn exceptional cases where it is not possible for intending parents to adopt the child, facilitation of the \nchild’s return to Canada may be made through discretionary citizenship or immigration case processing, \nincluding a temporary resident permit (TRP) and H&C permanent resident processing. If the use of H&C \nconsiderations for the permanent residence application or the issuance of a TRP is being considered, the \nofficer should take into account factors such as the best interests of the child and the provincial or \nterritorial legislation; some provinces and territories may not recognize the parent-child relationship in \nsurrogacy cases without any genetic link. In the province of Quebec, surrogacy agreements are null and \nhave no legal standing. \nFor more information on surrogacy, see Health Canada’s prohibitions related to surrogacy. \nFor the guidelines on the interpretation of the term “biological child” in situations where human \nreproductive technology is used, see OP 2, section 5.14. For instructions on taking into account H&C \nconsiderations, see the corresponding program delivery instructions. \nFor information on citizenship policy in relation to assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy \narrangements, see the citizenship program delivery instructions. \n6 Definitions \nAdoption \n[R3(2)] \nAn adoption, for the purposes of the IRPR, means an adoption that creates a legal \nparent-child relationship and severs the pre-existing legal parent-child relationship. This \ntype of child placement is referred to as a “full adoption”. \nBiological \nparent \nThe term “biological parent” refers to the natural or legal parent of the child at birth. \nWhere applicable, it could also refer to the legal parent prior to the issuance of an \nadoption order. \nCentral \nadoption \nauthority \nUnder the Hague Convention, states designate a central adoption authority that \nadministers intercountry adoptions in a manner consistent with the provisions of the \nConvention. In the case of Canada, the provinces and territories regulate adoptions so \nthat each has designated such authority. It is the provincial or territorial central adoption \nauthorities that must determine whether the Hague Convention applies to a particular \ncase. The Hague Conference on Private International Law website provides a list of all \ncentral adoption authorities for contracting states.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n26 \nDependent \nchild [R2] \nThe term “dependent child,” in respect of a parent, means a child who \n(a) has one of the following relationships with the parent, namely, \n(i) is the biological child of the parent, if the child has not been adopted \nby a person other than the spouse or common-law partner of the \nparent, or \n(ii) is the adopted child of the parent; and \n(b) is in one of the following situations of dependency, namely, \n(i) is less than 19 years of age and not a spouse or common-law \npartner, or \n(ii) is 19 years of age or older and has depended substantially on the \nfinancial support of the parent since before the age of 19 and is unable \nto be financially self-supporting due to physical or mental condition. \nOrphaned child \nor relative \nThe term “orphaned child or relative” means a person whose parents are deceased, \nwho is under 18 years of age, who is not a spouse or common-law partner and who is \n(i) a child of the sponsor’s mother or father; \n(ii) a child of a child of the sponsor’s mother or father; or \n(iii) a child of the sponsor’s child. \nGuardianship \nA legal guardian is a person who has the legal authority and the corresponding duty to \ncare for the personal interests of a child or adult. Even if a child has a legal guardian, \nthe relationship between the parents and the child may still remain active. \nGuardianship does not constitute an adoption (see section 5.19 for more information). \nHague \nConvention \nThe Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in \nrespect of Intercountry Adoption sets minimum standards and procedures for adoptions \nbetween countries. The Hague Convention is intended to end unethical adoption \npractices. It also promotes cooperation between countries and puts in place procedures \nthat minimize the chance of exploitation of children, birth parents or adoptive parents \nduring the adoption process. \nSee section 5.3 for more information. \nHome study  \nA home study is a professional assessment of prospective adoptive parents’ suitability \nto adopt a child. \nIntercountry \nadoption \nIntercountry adoption is the adoption of a child living in a different country from the \nadoptive parent(s).\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n27 \nSimple \nadoption  \nAccording to the Hague Convention, a simple adoption is one in which the parent-child \nrelationship that existed before the adoption is not terminated, but a new legal \nparent-child relationship between the child and their adoptive parents is established, \nand the adoptive parents acquire parental responsibility for the child. \nA simple adoption does not meet the requirements of the IRPA and IRPR. \n7 Procedure \n7.1 How to proceed in Hague Convention cases \nSee also section 5.3, section 5.4, section 6 and Appendix E for more information. \nThe notice of agreement (provincial or territorial letter authorizing the adoption under the Hague \nConvention) replaces the letter of no objection (see section 5.6 for more information). \nIn Hague Convention cases, adoptions may be finalized only when the child meets all requirements for \nobtaining permanent resident status in Canada. \nWhen an application is received in the case of an adoption to which the Hague Convention applies and a \nnotice of agreement is received from the provincial or territorial central adoption authority, visa offices \nmust do the following: \n \nmatch up the sponsorship with the application form and notice of agreement from the province or \nterritory; \n \nissue the medical examination form [IMM 1017], as appropriate; \n \npromptly notify the provincial or territorial central adoption authority by email (see the list of \ncentral adoption authorities in Appendix B and the sample email in Appendix D) when the child \nmeets immigration requirements (see section 5.4); the provincial or territorial central adoption \nauthority will then notify the central adoption authority in the country of origin, which will enable \nthe central adoption authority in the country of origin to finalize the adoption; and \n \nverify that the sponsors have authority to take the child to Canada once the visa office has been \nnotified by the provincial or territorial central adoption authority that adoption procedures or the \nchild’s transfer to the adoptive parents is complete. That authority to take the child to Canada \nmay be either the final adoption order, if the adoption has already taken place, or a custody order, \nif the adoption will occur in Canada. All adoption cases under the Hague Convention must be \napproved by the central adoption authority of the country of origin and the receiving province or \nterritory before a permanent resident visa may be issued. If the adoption was not approved by the \ncentral adoption authority, sponsors should be advised to contact the provincial or territorial \ncentral adoption authority. If the central adoption authorities do not approve the adoption, the visa \nofficer must refuse the application because it does not comply with subparagraph R117(1)(g)(ii) \nor paragraph R117(3)(f).\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n28 \n7.2 How to proceed in non-Hague Convention cases \nIn cases of adoption in which the Hague Convention does not apply, the requirements of \nparagraph R117(1)(g) or subsections R117(2) and (3), including those pertaining to child trafficking, \nundue gain and adoption of convenience must be met. \nWhen application forms and a sponsorship have been received in a non-Hague Convention case, visa \noffices should do the following: \n \nissue medical instructions, as appropriate; \n \nverify that a home study has been conducted or approved by a provincial, territorial or other \ncompetent authority; \n \nensure that a letter of no objection from the provincial or territorial central adoption authority \nwhere the parent resides is on file ; \n \nask the sponsor to follow up with the provincial or territorial central adoption authority if there is no \nletter of no objection; \n \nverify that the sponsors have authority to take the child to Canada with either the final adoption \norder, if the adoption occurs overseas, or a custody order, if the adoption will occur in Canada; \n \nensure that immigration requirements are met (see section 5.4); and \n \nverify that the child has a valid travel document. \n7.3 Children to be adopted in Canada (FC6) versus adopted \nchildren (FC9) \nFor most cases, the adoption is completed in the child’s country of origin, and an adoption order is issued \nin that country. The permanent residence application must be processed for an adopted child, according \nto subsections R117(2) and (3), and must be coded as FC9 in GCMS. \nIn some cases, the adoption order is issued by the Canadian provincial or territorial court after the child \narrives in Canada. These applications are processed as children to be adopted in Canada and coded as \nFC6 in GCMS. \nIf an application does not have the appropriate immigration category in GCMS, this should be corrected \nas soon as possible. Using the correct immigration category ensures the application is processed while \ntaking into account the corresponding requirements of the IRPR. Using the correct code also ensures that \nCIC compiles reliable data on FC9 and FC6 applications. \nFC6 cases must meet the regulatory requirements of paragraph R117(1)(g). This category can be used \nfor all countries, regardless of whether they follow the Hague Convention. \nAlthough the IRPR do not explicitly require that there be a home study in cases where the child is to be \nadopted in Canada, the Hague Convention requires that the central adoption authority in the receiving \nstate ensure that prospective adoptive parents are eligible and suitable to adopt. Provincial and territorial \ncentral adoption authorities normally require that prospective adoptive parents residing in Canada \nundergo a home study either for adoptions completed in the state of origin or in their province or territory,\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n29 \nand that the provincial or territorial central adoption authority confirm that a home study has been \ncompleted in their letter of no objection or notice of agreement. \nThe spirit of the Hague Convention must also be respected in non-Hague Convention cases. As a result, \nthe requirements involving the best interests of the child in subsection R117(3) must be taken into \naccount for non-Hague Convention FC6 cases. \nClause R117(1)(g)(iii)(A) requires that the child in a non-Hague FC6 case have been placed for adoption \nor be otherwise legally available for adoption in the country of origin. A legal document or court order \ngiving the legal custody to the adoptive parents for the purpose of adoption in Canada must be provided \nby the central adoption authority of the country of origin. The best interests of the child test must be met \nto respect Canada’s international obligations in regards to the rights of the child in all cases. The term \n“otherwise legally available” is not meant to overcome the inability to meet a country’s adoption \nrequirements. \nFor non-Hague Convention FC6 cases, visa offices must ensure that the following requirements are met: \n \na letter of no objection from the province or territory; \n \na completed home study; \n \nconsent of the central adoption authority in the country of origin; \n \na legal document giving the adoptive parents legal custody of the child; \n \nauthorization for adoptive parents to take the child out of the country of origin for the purpose of \nadoption in Canada; \n \na declaration of abandonment and a letter of consent from an orphanage if the child is orphaned \nor abandoned; \n \na letter of consent from the child’s biological parents, if applicable; \n \nno evidence of undue gain or child trafficking; \n \nno evidence of the adoption being entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or \nprivilege (not an adoption of convenience); and \n \na medical statement. \n7.4 Case Processing Centre procedure for requesting a letter of no \nobjection \nA letter of no objection or a notice of agreement is not required to begin processing the IMM 1344 form. \nOn receipt of a sponsorship application, CPC-M staff must verify completion of the application, and send \na letter to the provincial or territorial central adoption authority requesting issuance of either a letter of no \nobjection (non-Hague Convention cases) or a notification of agreement (Hague Convention cases). The \nprovincial and territorial central adoption authorities make the determination between the two types of \ncases, inform the mission accordingly, and contact the visa office directly. \nThere is no requirement for a provincial or territorial statement for children adopted outside Canada when \nadoptive parents were not residing in a Canadian territory or province at the time of the adoption. The \nrequirement for a provincial or territorial letter outlined in paragraph R117(3)(e) indicates the need for a \nwritten statement of no objection only if the sponsor resided in Canada at the time the adoption took \nplace.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n30 \nFor sponsors residing in Quebec, see Appendix A for more information. \n7.5 Information on the child’s medical condition \nAdoptive parents must provide a written statement in which they acknowledge that they have obtained \nmedical information about the child they have adopted or intend to adopt. A visa officer must be in receipt \nof this statement before a permanent resident visa may be issued. A medical condition statement is \nissued to sponsoring parents with other permanent resident application material. They are instructed to \nsign and return the statement to the mission when they have medical information concerning their child \n[R118]. \n7.6 High-profile or contentious cases \nThis content has been moved as part of our efforts to modernize operational guidance to staff. It can now \nbe found in the program delivery instructions concerning how to handle high-profile, complex, sensitive or \ncontentious cases. \n7.7 Changing a child’s name in the IMM 1344 form \nIf a sponsored child is no longer available for adoption, sponsors may ask the CPC-M to replace the \nname of the child on the IMM 1344 form with the name of another child. The CPC-M must provide the \nnew name to the visa office and the provincial or territorial central adoption authority. \nIf the visa office is contacted first, they should advise the sponsor to provide the name of the new child to \nthe CPC-M and the provincial or territorial central adoption authority. \nThe CPC-M does not charge a new processing fee when it replaces a name for this reason. \n7.8 Multiple adoptions \nCases may arise where a sponsorship application in support of a child to be adopted is still pending for \none unnamed child, and the sponsor is notified that the birth resulted in multiple children or that there are \nother siblings available for adoption. If the sponsor wants to adopt the second or more children, they must \ncomplete a separate IMM 1344 form for each child for submission to the CPC-M with the required \ndocuments. The sponsor should write “SIBLING ADOPTION” on the envelope to facilitate the cross-\nreferencing of the new application(s) to the existing one. \nPayment of fees for all additional new applications is required. \n7.9 Simultaneous citizenship and permanent residence applications \nSimultaneous applications for the same adopted person under both the Citizenship Act and the IRPA may \nbe submitted. For additional information, see CP 14, section 7.4.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n31 \n7.10 Improperly documented arrivals: adoptions \nSee ENF 4, Port of entry examinations. \n7.11 Establishing identity and relationship \nSee OP 2, Processing members of the family class. \n7.12 Identity and relationship documents \nIn cases of adoption, the following documents must be provided to the visa office: \n \nidentity documents for the child; \n \ndocuments that include names of the biological parents of the child; \n \nfinal adoption order (FC9) or custody order to the adoptive parents for the purpose of adoption in \nCanada (FC6); and \n \npassport or travel document for the child. \nThe assessment of relationship refers not only to the legal relationship between the adoptive family and \nthe child but also to the relationship of the child to their biological family. \nOfficers should request documents such as a birth certificate to ascertain who the biological parents of \nthe child are. \nFor information on the naming policy, see Naming procedures: Establishing name records in CIC \nsystems. \nFor further information, see OP 2, Processing members of the family class. \n7.13 Admissibility requirements \nOfficers must be satisfied that applicants are not inadmissible and meet all requirements of the family \nclass [A11(1)]. \nSection R30 requires foreign nationals who are applying for permanent residence to undergo a medical \nexamination. Instructions on the medical requirement can be found in the Medical requirements section. \nIf an adopted child or a child to be adopted is inadmissible to Canada, the application should be refused. \nSee the following table for details: \nReason for \nadmissibility or \ninadmissibility \nDetails \nMedical \nA child who has been adopted outside Canada or who will be adopted in Canada \ncannot be found to be inadmissible on the basis of a condition that may cause an\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n32 \nexcessive demand on health or social services [A38(2)(a)]. If a child is inadmissible \nfor other medical reasons, the child does not meet immigration requirements, and the \nadoption cannot be finalized. The provincial or territorial central adoption authority \nand the sponsor must be notified. \nProvincial or \nterritorial letter of no \nobjection \nFor more information, see section 5 6. \nIf a case is refused on the basis that it does not comply with the requirement that the \nprovince or territory issue a letter of no objection as per clause R117(1)(g)(iii)(B) or \nparagraph R117(3)(e), there is a right of appeal for the sponsor. However, because \nthe child to be adopted is not a member of the family class as described in \nsubsection R117(1), the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) will not consider H&C \ngrounds [A65]. The IAD may not consider H&C considerations unless it has decided \nthat the foreign national is a member of the family class and that their sponsor is a \nsponsor within the meaning of the IRPR. \nAdoption of \nconvenience \nSee the program delivery instructions on how to identify a relationship of \nconvenience. \nNot a member of \nthe family class \nIf an applicant is not a member of the family class as defined in subsection R117(1), \nthe application must be refused. \n7.14 Visa issuance \nOfficers may not issue a permanent resident visa to a child adopted from a country that has ratified or \nacceded to the Hague Convention without a notification of agreement or a letter of non objection from the \nprovincial or territorial central adoption authority. \nWhen a child meets all immigration requirements \n \nin a case in which the Hague Convention applies, the officer should advise the provincial or \nterritorial central adoption authority that a permanent resident visa will be issued (see Appendix D \nfor more information); \n \nand has a verifiable travel document, if the sponsors have the authority to take the child to \nCanada, the officer may issue a permanent resident visa; \n \nand was adopted in the country of origin, the officer should use code FC9 (child adopted abroad); \nif the adoption is to take place in Canada, in the province or territory of destination, the officer \nshould use code FC6 (child to be adopted in Canada); or \n \nin a Hague Convention case, the officer should enter the abbreviation HAG in the special \nprogram field in the GCMS application. The HAG special program code will also appear on the \nConfirmation of Permanent Residence. This identification is necessary because Canada has an \nobligation to report the number of adoption cases dealt with under the Hague Convention.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n33 \nAppendix A – Province-specific information for counselling \nThis section provides an overview of legislation in place in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec \nthat has a direct impact on the processing of adoption cases. This information is part of the counselling to \nbe provided to parents. \nAlberta \nSubsection 62(3) of Alberta’s Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act states the following: \n“No application for an adoption order shall be filed in respect of a child unless the child is a \nCanadian citizen or has been lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence.” \nTherefore, residents of Alberta cannot obtain an adoption order on behalf of a child who is not a \npermanent resident of Canada. A child who comes to Canada on a temporary resident permit, a \ntemporary resident visa, or a student visa cannot be adopted in Alberta. A Canadian or permanent \nresident couple who has a legal guardianship order for a child cannot obtain an adoption order if the child \nhas not obtained a permanent resident visa or Canadian citizenship prior to arrival in Canada. By \nrequiring the adoption to be completed prior to arrival in Alberta or by having the adoption arrangements \nreviewed by an officer outside Canada, Alberta is seeking to ensure that all legal and birth-parent issues \nare addressed prior to the child’s arrival in the province. \nBritish Columbia \nSubsection 48(1) of the British Columbia Adoption Act states the following: \n“Before a child who is not a resident of British Columbia is brought into the province for adoption, \nthe prospective adoptive parents must obtain the approval of a director or an adoption agency.” \nThe adoption agency must be one licensed by the province. \nSubsection 48(2) states the following: \n“The director or the adoption agency must grant approval if \n(a) the parent or other guardian placing the child for adoption has been provided with \ninformation about adoption and the alternatives to adoption, \n(b) the prospective adoptive parents have been provided with information about the medical \nand social history of the child’s biological family, \n(c) a home study of the prospective adoptive parents has been completed in accordance \nwith the regulations and the prospective adoptive parents have been approved on the \nbasis of the home study, and \n(d) the consents have been obtained as required in the jurisdiction in which the child is \nresident.”\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n34 \nParents who have not obtained the approval prior to bringing the child to British Columbia are in \ncontravention of the British Columbia Adoption Act, and such an offence is punishable under the Offences \nand Penalties section of this Act. \nExceptions to section 48 of the British Columbia Adoption Act are made for a child brought into British \nColumbia for adoption by a relative of the child or by a person who will become an adoptive parent jointly \nwith the child‘s birth parent and for a child who is a permanent ward of an extra-provincial agency. \nOntario \nUnder the Ontario Intercountry Adoption Act, 1998, the prospective adoptive parents, including those \nadopting relatives, must \n \nmake an application to adopt with an international adoption agency that is licensed by the Ontario \nMinistry of Children and Youth Services; \n \nhave an adoption home study completed by an adoption practitioner approved by a Ministry \nDirector; and \n \nobtain the Ministry Director’s approval of their eligibility and suitability to adopt based on the home \nstudy report. \nIt is an offence for an Ontario resident to leave the province to adopt internationally or finalize an \ninternational adoption without satisfying each of these requirements. The penalty for contravention of this \nprovision is, on conviction, a fine of up to $2,000, imprisonment for up to two years, or both. \nOnly international adoption agencies licensed by the Ministry of Community and Social Services under \nthe Intercountry Adoption Act, 1998 can operate in Ontario to facilitate international adoptions finalized \noutside Ontario. It is an offence for any other person or organization to provide this service. \nIn cases where the child’s country of origin requires Ontario’s approval before the adoption can be \nfinalized, the proposed adoption placement requires the approval of the Ministry Director. \nQuebec \nFor sponsors residing in Quebec, the CPC-M forwards a copy of the undertaking [IMM 1344] to the \nMinistère de l’Immigration, de la Diversité et et de l’Inclusion (MIDI). The CPC-M also sends a letter to \nsponsors, instructing them to download the MIDI engagement application and submit it directly to the \nMIDI with a copy of the CPC-M letter. \nThe MIDI assesses sponsors, and if their requirements are met, issues a Quebec Selection Certificate for \nthe child and sends the required documents to the corresponding visa office for the country of origin. The \nSecrétariat à l’adoption internationale du Québec is responsible for issuing letters of no objection directly \nto the adopting parents. \nThe effects of adopting a child domiciled outside Quebec are governed by the Civil Code of Quebec. \nAdoption procedures must be undertaken by a certified organization. Since February 1, 2006, to override \nthis general rule, the criteria and conditions set forth in the Ministerial Order respecting the adoption\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n35 \nwithout a certified body of a child domiciled outside Québec by a person domiciled in Québec must be \nmet. \nUnder section 565 of the Civil Code of Quebec, \n“[...] A decision granted abroad must be recognized by the court in Québec, unless the adoption \nhas been certified by the competent authority of the State where it took place as having been \nmade in accordance with the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect \nof Intercountry Adoption.” \nAs a result, adoptions legally recognized overseas are recognized in Quebec after the child arrives in \nCanada and when some procedures are completed in Quebec. \nIf the Hague Convention applies in the child’s country of origin, the adoption judgment issued in that \ncountry is simply accepted in Quebec. \nIf the Hague Convention does not apply in the child’s country of origin, the adoptive parents must have \nthe foreign adoption judgment recognized by the Youth Division of the Court of Quebec for the adoption \nto be official.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n36 \nAppendix B – Provincial and territorial information and contacts \nfor adoption cases \nRefer to the information provided on Canada’s provincial and territorial central adoption authorities on the \nHague Conference on Private International Law website.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n37 \nAppendix C – List of countries that have implemented the Hague \nConvention \nFor the current list of countries that have implemented the Hague Convention, refer to the Hague \nConference on Private International Law website.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n38 \nAppendix D – Sample email sent by the visa office to the \nprovincial or territorial central authority in Hague Convention \ncases \nCanadian Embassy \nImmigration section \nProvincial central authority \nAddress \nDear Sir or Madam: \nSubject: Child’s name, date of birth, country of origin, file number; prospective adoptive parents’ \nnames \nThis refers to the application for permanent residence in Canada of [child’s name], whom [prospective \nparents’ names] intend to adopt. \nAs agreed with your Ministry with respect to the processing of an adoption case governed by the Hague \nConvention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, please be \ninformed that [child’s name] now meets the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \nand its Regulations.

Please \nsend us your notification of agreement to the adoption proposal if it has not already been sent. A \npermanent resident visa will be issued to the child when we receive the travel document and the adoption \norder, if the child was adopted in the country of origin, or a confirmation that the transfer of the child to \nCanada has been authorized, if the adoption will take place in your province. \nPlease be assured that the permanent residence application of [child’s name] will receive prioritized \nprocessing. \nYours sincerely, \n \nVisa officer \nc.c.: sponsor\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n39 \nAppendix E Standard process for intercountry adoption: Hague \nConvention – Parents in Canada \n \nThe prospective adoptive parents contact a province or territory’s ministry or a licensed adoption \nagency. \na) The provincial or territorial central adoption authority requests a home study of the \nprospective parents from a competent authority to determine suitability. \nb) When the home study is received by the province or territory, the central adoption \nauthority prepares a report on the competency of the prospective adoptive parents and \nforwards it to the central adoption authority in the country where the child resides. \nc) The sponsorship process normally begins once a recommendation is made by the \nprovince or territory. \n \nThe sponsor submits their sponsorship application to the CPC-M, indicating their intention to \nadopt. The application names the child to be adopted, or if the child has not been identified, \nindicates the country where the adoption will take place. \n \nThe CPC-M advises the central adoption authority in the province or territory of intended \ndestination of the sponsor’s intent to adopt, provides information related to the child or to the \ncountry where the adoption will take place and requests a letter of no objection or notice of \nagreement. \n \nThe CPC-M creates a permanent residence application in GCMS and forwards the sponsorship \nrecommendation to the visa office. \n \nThe central adoption authority in the country where the child resides reviews the report and \ninformation on the prospective adoptive parents, matches the prospective adoptive parents to a \nchild, prepares an adoption proposal and forwards the proposal to the central adoption authority \nin the province or territory of destination. \n \nThe provincial or territorial central adoption authority reviews and assesses the information \nrelated to the child, provides provincial or territorial agreement and submits the information to the \nprospective adoptive parents for their approval. \n \nThe province or territory prepares a notice of agreement signed by the prospective adoptive \nparents and forwards it to the visa office and the central adoption authority in the child’s country \nof residence. \n \nThe visa office combines the information on the immigration application, the sponsorship \ninformation and the notice of agreement to form a complete file and application. \n \nThe prospective adoptive parents complete and sign the Medical Condition Statement, indicating \nknowledge of the child’s health condition, and send it to the visa office. \n \nThe notice of agreement should be considered as fulfilling the requirements of \nsubsection R117(2) unless the visa office has reasonable grounds to believe that the process of \nthe central adoption authority in the child’s country of residence lacks integrity or competency \n(see section 5.7 for more information). \n \nIf the visa office is satisfied with the notice of agreement, the child (applicant) is then assessed \nagainst the eligibility criteria. \n \nThe visa office informs the provincial or territorial central adoption authority of the results (e.g., \nthe applicant meets the requirements). The provincial or territorial central adoption authority, in \nturn, informs the central adoption authority in the child’s country of residence.\nOP 3 Adoptions \n2015-11-09 \n \n40 \n \nAdoption procedures are completed by the central adoption authority, and adoption papers are \nissued and forwarded to the visa office. \n \nOnce the adoption procedures have been completed and the final adoption order is received, the \nvisa officer completes the immigration process and issues a visa."
