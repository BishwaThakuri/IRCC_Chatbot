You need to get an ECA for immigration\npurposes. If you got another type of ECA, you may be able to get it re-\nissued, depending on the type of ECA and/or issuing organization.\nYou must include your ECA report and the reference number in your Express\nEntry profile.\nYour ECA report may help when you’re looking for a job, but it doesn’t\nguarantee that:\nyou’ll get a job in your field, or at a certain level\nyou’ll get a license to practice in a regulated profession (job)\nIf you plan to work in a regulated job, you must get your license in the\nprovince or territory that you plan to settle in.\nWho needs an ECA\nIf you completed your education outside Canada, you need an Educational\ncredential assessment (ECA) to:\nbe eligible as the principal applicant for Federal Skilled Workers\nProgram (Express Entry), or\nearn points for education you got outside Canada\nYou can also earn points for your spouse or common-law partner’s\neducation, if they are coming with you to Canada.\nYou don’t need an assessment for a Canadian degree, diploma or\ncertificate.\nTo earn points, your report must show that your completed foreign\ncredential (degree, diploma or certificate) is equal to a completed Canadian\nsecondary school (high school) or post-secondary credential.\nHow long your ECA is valid for\nYour ECA must be less than 5 years old when you:\ncomplete your Express Entry profile, and\nsubmit your application\nIf you’ve been invited to apply\nMake sure your ECA will still be valid when you plan to apply.\nIf you haven’t been invited to apply\nMake sure your ECA is valid for the rest of the time you’ll be in the pool.\nIf your assessment will expire before you can apply, contact the\norganization that issued it. They may re-issue it, depending on the type\nof ECA and/or the organization.\nIf you apply with an expired ECA, we’ll refuse your application.\nGet an ECA\nWhich credentials to get assessed\nIn most cases, you only need an assessment for your highest level of\neducation.\nFor example, if you have a Master’s degree, you only need an assessment\nfor that degree. You don’t need one for your Bachelor’s degree.\nWhen to get an assessment for 2 or more credentials\nTo get points for having 2 or more credentials, you need an assessment\nfor each one.\nTo get full points for more than 1 credential, at least 1 of the credentials\nmust be for 3 or more years of study.\nThe order that you complete your credentials does not affect points.\nWhen to get your secondary education assessed\nIf your post-secondary credential is not equal to a Canadian credential,\nyou could get your secondary credential assessed. This would get you\npoints for completing secondary school.\nWho can do your assessment\nYou must get your assessment from an organization or a professional body\ndesignated by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. They will give\nyou a report that tells you what your education is equal to in Canada.\nProcessing times and costs may vary by organization or professional body.\nOnce you choose a designated organization or a professional body, they will\ntell you how to submit your documents to get your assessment.\nDesignated organizations\nMost people must use one of these designated organizations:\nOrganization\nDate\ndesignated\nComparative Education Service – University of Toronto\nSchool of Continuing Studies\nApril 17, 2013\nInternational Credential Assessment Service of Canada\nApril 17, 2013\nWorld Education Services\nApril 17, 2013\nInternational Qualifications Assessment Service (IQAS)\nAugust 6, 2015\nInternational Credential Evaluation Service – British\nColumbia Institute of Technology\nAugust 6, 2015\nDesignated professional bodies\nIf your primary occupation is as an architect, doctor or a pharmacist,\nyou must use a designated professional body based on your occupation.\nArchitects (NOC 21200)\nSpecialists and family physicians (NOC 31100, NOC 31101 or NOC\n31102)\nPharmacists (NOC 31120)\nSubmit your report\n1.
