Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n3 \n \nUpdates to chapter \nListing by date: \n \nDate: 2008-06-25 \nChanges were made to Section 3.1:  \n• \nClarification of forms required for inland monitoring of Entrepreneurs selected under the \nImmigration Act (1976) versus those required for Entrepreneurs selected under IRPA.  \n \n2006-01-11 \nChanges were made to reflect the transition from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) to \nthe Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The term “delegated authority” has been replaced \nby “Minister’s delegate” where appropriate and new information on removal order stays has been \nadded to section 12.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n4 \n1. \nWhat this chapter is about \nThis chapter describes the in-Canada immigration functions as they relate to the entrepreneur \nclass of foreign nationals. Entrepreneurs are one of the economic classes. \nThis chapter provides guidance on inland procedures that relate to entrepreneurs after they have \nbeen admitted to Canada. It is intended primarily for use at inland and regional offices. \nFor procedures relating to the selection of entrepreneurs overseas, please see Entrepreneur and \nSelf-Employed (OP 8). \nFor procedures relating to the admission and granting of permanent residence to entrepreneurs, \nplease see Port of Entry Examinations (ENF 4).  \nNote: Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), conditions are imposed overseas and \nthe port of entry provides counselling. \n2. \nProgram objectives \nThe Entrepreneur Program supports the economic objective in A3, which aims to contribute to a \nstrong and prosperous Canadian economy across all regions of Canada. \nThe intent of the Entrepreneur Program is to encourage and facilitate the immigration of qualified \nbusiness persons from abroad who will make a positive contribution to the country's economic \ndevelopment. They are expected to apply their capital and know-how to Canadian businesses \nwhich create jobs for Canadians and permanent residents of Canada. \nEntrepreneurs and their family members are granted permanent residence under specific \nconditions that are monitored by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). \n3. \nThe Act and Regulations \nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and its accompanying Regulations came into \nforce on June 28, 2002. They replace the Immigration Act of 1976, known as the \"former Act\", \nand the 1978 Regulations.  \nTable 1: Legislative references, which relate to the Entrepreneur Program \nFor more information about: \nRefer to:  \nObjectives: support a strong Canadian economy, benefits of immigration \nshared by all regions \nA3(1)(c) \nSelection of economic foreign nationals \nA12(2) \nRegulations may prescribe conditions by class \nA26(d), A32(d) \nPermanent resident must comply with conditions \nA27(2) \nPermanent resident who fails to comply with conditions is inadmissible \nA41(b) \nInadmissibility report \nA44(1) \nMembers of entrepreneur class \nR97(1) \nConditions of permanent residence \nR98(1) \nEntrepreneur must meet conditions within specified time \nR98(3) \nEntrepreneur must provide evidence of compliance \nR98(4) \nReporting requirement  \nR98(5) \nFamily members subject to conditions \nR98(6) \nEntrepreneurs selected by provinces \nR99 \nSelection criteria \nR102 \nPoints for experience \nR103\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n5 \nPoints for adaptability \nR104 \nRequirements for family members \nR106 \nSelection by visa office \nR108 \nTransitional provisions for economic classes \nR361, R363 \n3.1. \nForms required \nThe forms required are shown in the following table. Their use depends on whether the \nEntrepreneur was selected under the Immigration Act (1976) or under IRPA. \nAll forms required for Entrepreneurs selected under the Immigration Act (1976), as well as the \nInformation Guide, can be found on CIC’s Web site at \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/business/entrepreneurs/monitoring-1976.asp \nAll forms required for Entrepreneurs selected under IRPA, as well as the Information Guide, can \nbe found at http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/business/entrepreneurs/monitoring-irpa.asp \nTable 2: Forms \nForm Title \nForm number \nEntrepreneur Monitoring Checklist \nIMM 5164B \nMail-In Card for Entrepreneurs (1976 Act) \nIMM 5215B \nEntrepreneur Monitoring Report (1976 Act) \nIMM 5343B \nApplication to Vary or Cancel Terms and Conditions of Landing – \nEntrepreneur (1976 Act) \nIMM 5344B \nEntrepreneur Counselling and Monitoring Guide, 1976 Immigration Act \nIMM 5348E \nMail-In Card for Entrepreneurs (IRPA) \nIMM 5548B \nEntrepreneur Monitoring Report (IRPA) \nIMM 5486B \nApplication to Remove Entrepreneur Conditions (IRPA)   \nIMM 5547B \nEntrepreneur Counselling and Monitoring Guide, IRPA \nIMM 5479E \n4. \nInstruments and delegations \nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness designate persons or classes of persons to carry out any purpose or provision \ncited in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These designated authorities are known as \ndelegations and they stem from A6(1) and A6(2). They are further described by the Instruments \nand are housed in IL 3.  \nThe instruments specify authorities geographically and are to be read regionally, nationally or \ninternationally in accordance with the physical location of the officer.  \nTo identify specific delegations and designations see IL 3. For the purposes of this chapter, refer \nspecifically to the following references: \nA15(4) \nA16(1) and A16 (2)(a) \nA189 \nR88(1) \nR91 \nR93(1) and R93(2) \nR94 \nR98(4) and R98(5)\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n6 \n5. \nDepartmental policy \n5.1. \nActive and ongoing management \nIn order to satisfy the requirement for active and ongoing management of the Canadian business, \nthe entrepreneur must be actively involved in management decisions through involvement in the \noperations of the business on a continuing basis. \nThe officer should judge each case on its own merits. The entrepreneur is not required to be \npresent every day  \nPassive investment in real estate, stocks, bonds or other securities, or other investments made \nprimarily with the hope of capital appreciation, would, in itself, not satisfy the requirement of active \nand ongoing management.  \n5.2. \nOutstanding conditions \nConditions of permanent residence for an entrepreneur and family members: \n• \nremain in effect until cancelled by an officer;  \n• \nrequire the entrepreneur to comply with the conditions within a three-year period from the \ndate permanent residence was granted.  \nThe entrepreneur must meet the conditions for a period of at least one year within the period of \nthree years after the day on which the entrepreneur becomes a permanent resident. \nBefore the expiry of this period, the entrepreneur is required to provide evidence of compliance.  \nAfter the expiry of this period, if a final decision regarding the entrepreneur's conditions has not \nbeen made, the entrepreneur is said to have outstanding conditions.  \n5.3. \nCancelling conditions of permanent residence \nConditions are imposed on all entrepreneurs including the requirement to furnish evidence of \ncompliance [R98(4)]. \nThe Application to Cancel Conditions (IMM 5344B) is the formal mechanism available for \nentrepreneurs to have their conditions of permanent residence cancelled.  \nOfficers should counsel all entrepreneurs who have satisfied their conditions to complete an \nApplication to Cancel Conditions. If the family members were granted permanent residence with \nconditions, they should be included on the application. \n5.4. \nEnforcement \nEnforcement, or the threat of enforcement, should not be used in a coercive manner. Efforts \nshould be taken to identify ways the entrepreneur can meet the conditions and avoid the need for \nenforcement action.  \nNote: Enforcement should be a last resort. \nConditions are contravened only after the time set out for compliance has expired.  \n5.5. \nPromoting business immigration \nSubject to operational priorities, officers may be able to provide objective information about the \nEntrepreneur Program to applicants and third-party representatives. Again, subject to operational \npressures, officers will occasionally be able to take an active promotion and marketing role.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n7 \nPromotional efforts should familiarize potential applicants with the services offered by provincial \ngovernments to business foreign nationals. Where feasible, officers should coordinate their \npromotional efforts with provincial government representatives. \nOfficers may encourage individuals to apply as entrepreneurs in a variety of ways. For more \ninformation, see section 5.2 and section 5.3 above. \n5.6. \nSupplying promotional material \nOne example of promotional material is “Applying for Permanent Residence Business Class \nApplicants”, which is available on the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) Web site \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/applications/business.html. This guide explains the entrepreneur, \ninvestor and self-employed classes and application procedures. It is a standard source of written \ncounselling information on the Business Immigration Program from the federal government.  \nOther promotional material is available from National Headquarters, Business Immigration \nDivision. \n5.7. \nProvincial programs \nOfficers are obliged to apply the regulatory definition of \"entrepreneur.” There are, however, \nprovincial nominee programs that may select persons who have a business background and are \nnot subject to the federal “entrepreneur” definition. \nThe provincial nominee programs reflect provincial or territorial priorities, experience and \nknowledge of local conditions. \nSeveral provinces also offer business seminars which provide information about the immigration \nprocess as well as the business culture in Canada. The provinces encourage qualified foreign \nbusiness people to visit the province and provide assistance to those who wish to immigrate and \nresettle.  \n5.8. \nPending Applications Submitted before January, 2002 and Transitional Classes  \nAccording to R361, all active applications under the federal economic classes that were submitted \nbefore January 1, 2002, shall be assessed according to the selection criteria of both the previous \nImmigration Regulations, 1978 and the IRP Regulations. These cases are to be assessed first \nunder whichever regulations appear most favourable to them and then, if unsuccessful, under the \nremaining regulations.  \nIn addition, R109.1 to R109.5 create transitional economic classes, including Transitional \nEntrepreneurs and Transitional Self-employed Persons. The transitional classes are composed of \ntwo groups of applicants whose cases have been closed but who will be eligible to submit new \napplications (including Economic Classes – Business immigrants, IMM 0008, Schedule 6) before \nJanuary 1, 2005. These cases are assessed first under whichever regulations appear most \nfavourable to them and then, if unsuccessful, under the remaining regulation. The two groups of \neligible applicants are: \n• \napplicants who originally applied before January 1, 2002 under the federal economic \nclasses and who were refused, for any reason including statutory grounds, between April 1, \n2003 and June 19, 2003; and \n• \napplicants who originally applied before January 1, 2002 under the federal economic \nclasses and who withdrew their application, for any reason, between January 1, 2002 and \nOctober 31, 2003. \nConditions will be imposed on entrepreneurs under the former Immigration Act or IRPA. \nHowever, because the conditions under the two acts differ, visa officers must clearly specify the \nregulations under which they accept each applicant in this category.  In addition to their CAIPS \nnotes and coding requirements, visa officers should indicate on the applicant’s Confirmation of\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n8 \nPermanent Residence form (IMM 5509B) either: “T&C’S TO IMPOSE UNDER FORMER \nREGULATIONS” or “T&C’S TO IMPOSE UNDER IRPA.” This will serve not only to inform \nofficers at the port of entry, but will also provide an official notice to the applicant.  \n \nCoding Conditions in CAIPS \nAt the moment, CAIPS will automatically generate coding 70 for entrepreneurs, which is the code \nreferring to conditions imposed on entrepreneurs under the former Immigration Act. For those \n(entrepreneurs or their family members) who need medical surveillance in addition to their \nspecific EN2 conditions, coding 72 or 73 will be printed automatically on the Confirmation of \nPermanent Residence form. \nHowever, since CAIPS will automatically generate codes relating to conditions described in the \nformer Immigration Act, visa officers must change the coding for conditions selected under \nIRPA. The coding should be 74 (instead of 70) and 75 or 76 (instead of 72 or 73) if medical \nsurveillance conditions apply in addition to the EN2 conditions. Officers should be sure to enter 75 \nor 76, in addition to the EN2 conditions, only for the person who needs medical surveillance in \naddition to the EN2 conditions. \nTo make the change in coding, visa officers will enter the appropriate codes at the time they enter \nthe final decision at the end of the process. \nSee RIM–03-078 and RIM-03-079A for further information. \n5.9. \nReleasing information to provinces and territories \nProvinces and territories may wish to be kept informed of visas issued to business foreign \nnationals destined to their area. A number of provinces have negotiated memoranda of \nunderstanding (MOUs) to facilitate the exchange of information. \nThe MOUs allow CIC to provide certain personal information regarding applicants destined to the \nprovince, on a monthly basis. This information allows the provinces to assist  entrepreneurs \nbefore and after arrival. \nThe Business Immigration Division at NHQ manages this process. \n6. \nDefinitions \nTo see definitions in the Act and Regulations, click on the appropriate section. The definitions in \nR88 are in alphabetical order. \n6.1. \nActive and ongoing management \n• \n\"active\" management means causing action or change; \n• \n\"ongoing\" management means continuing. \n6.2. \nBusiness experience  \nIn respect of an entrepreneur, “business experience” means a minimum of two years of \nexperience consisting of two one-year periods of experience in the management of a qualifying \nbusiness and the control of a percentage of equity of the qualifying business during the period \nbeginning five years before the date of application for a permanent resident visa and ending on \nthe day a determination is made in respect of the application [R88]. \n6.3. \nEMIS: Entrepreneur Monitoring Information System \n• \nan information system on entrepreneurs (see How EMIS is used, section 7.6 below);\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n9 \n• \ncontains application and permanent residence information on entrepreneurs granted \npermanent residence in Canada; \n• \none of CIC’s Personal Information Banks (PIB). \n6.4. \nEmployment \nAny activity for which a person receives or might reasonably be expected to receive valuable \nconsideration. \n6.5. \nEntrepreneur \nAn entrepreneur  \n• \nhas business experience; \n• \nhas a legally obtained net worth of at least $300,000; and \n• \nprovides a written statement to an officer that they intend and will be able to meet the \nconditions referred to in subsections R98(1) to R98(5). \n6.6. \nEntrepreneur selected by a province \nAn “entrepreneur selected by a province” means an entrepreneur who \n(a) intends to reside in a province the government of which has, under subsection 8(1) of the Act, \nentered into an agreement referred to in subsection 9(1) of the Act with the Minister whereby the \nprovince has sole responsibility for the selection of entrepreneurs; and \n(b) is named in a selection certificate issued to them by that province.  \n(entrepreneur sélectionné par une province) \n6.7. \nFull-time job equivalent \n1,950 hours of paid employment [R88]. \n6.8. \nLimited partnership  \nA limited partnership is a partnership with general partners having joint and several liability and \nlimited partners with liability limited to the extent of their investments. By definition, participation \nas a limited partner does not meet the active and ongoing management requirement and, \ntherefore, cannot be used by entrepreneurs to meet their conditions. \n6.9. \nMail-in card for Entrepreneurs (IMM 5215B) \n• \nincluded in Entrepreneur Counselling and Monitoring Guide (IMM 5479E); \n• \nto report to CIC within six months, giving address and phone number, etc.  \n6.10. \nNet assets \nThe assets of the business, minus liabilities, plus shareholder loans from a foreign national who is \nmaking or has made an application for permanent residence and their spouse or common-law \npartner [R88]. \nTo determine whether the net asset requirement has been met, the balance sheet, which is a \nsnapshot of the financial position of a business at a given point, is reviewed.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n10 \nAssets include everything of value owned, e.g., cash, accounts receivable, land, buildings, \ninventory, supplies, prepaid expenses, and possibly intangible assets such as goodwill, \ntrademarks, copyrights, etc. \nLiabilities include obligations to other businesses such as accounts payable, or to individuals such \nas shareholder loans. \nOwners' equity represents the net of these two and is generally comprised of the capital stock of \nthe owners of the business and retained earnings.  Retained earnings represent the reinvestment \nof earnings in the business that are carried forward each year. \nTable 3 is an example of how net assets are calculated. \nTable 3: Calculation of net assets \nBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2001 \n Assets \n \n Current assets \n \nCash \n$25,000\nAccounts receivable \n$20,000\nInventory \n$50,000\nPrepaid expenses \n$5,000\n Total current assets \n$100,000\n Fixed assets \n$95,000\nGoodwill \n$5,000\nTotal fixed assets \n$100,000\nTotal assets \n$200,000\n \n Liabilities and owner's equity \n Current liabilities \nAccounts payable \n$10,000\nIncome taxes  \n$5,000\nTotal current liabilities \n$15,000\nShareholder's loan \n$100,000\nBank loan \n$30,000\nTotal liabilities \n$160,000\nShareholder's equity \nCapital stock \n$500\nRetained earnings \n$39,500\n Total shareholder’s equity \n$40,000\n       Total liabilities and shareholder's equity \n$200,000 \nIn this example, the entrepreneur meets the net asset requirement of $125,000 based on assets \nminus liabilities of $40,000 plus $100,000 of shareholder's loans.  \n6.11. \nNet income  \nAfter-tax profit or loss plus remuneration to a foreign national who is making or has made an \napplication for a permanent resident visa and their spouse or common-law partner [R88]. \nNet income means after-tax income or loss plus remuneration to the entrepreneur and their \nspouse or common-law partner. The income statement reflects the profitability of a business \nentity. Table 4 is an example of how net income is calculated. \nTable 4: Calculation of net income\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n11 \nTotal sales for the year \n$300,000\nLess returns \n$8,000\nNet sales \n$292,000\nCost of goods sold \n$132,000\nGross profit \n$160,000\nOperating expenses \nManagement salary \n$50,000\nPayroll wages \n$40,000\nRent \n$10,000\nSelling expenses \n$30,000\nTotal operating expenses \n$130,000\nIncome before taxes \n$30,000\nIncome taxes \n$10,000\nNet income \n$20,000\nIn this example, the net income is $20,000.  \nHowever, any remuneration to the foreign national and spouse or common-law partner, including \na wage, salary or management fee, is added. In this case a management fee of $50,000 was paid \nto the sole owner of the corporation. This is added to the net income after tax of $20,000 = \n$70,000. Using this formula, the entrepreneur who is a 100% shareholder of the corporation \nwould meet the requirement for net income. (Based upon the above example, this entrepreneur \nwould also meet the attribute for sales). \n6.12. \nNet worth \nIn respect of an entrepreneur, “minimum net worth” means $300,000. \n6.13. \nOwnership of a qualifying Canadian business \n“Ownership of a qualifying Canadian business” means \na business operated in Canada by an entrepreneur other than a business operated \nprimarily for the purpose of deriving investment income, such as interest, dividends or \ncapital gains -- for which there is in any year within the period of three years after the day \nthe entrepreneur becomes a permanent resident documentary evidence of any two of the \nfollowing: \n(a) the percentage of equity multiplied by the number of full-time job equivalents is equal \nto or greater than two full-time job equivalents per year; \n(b) the percentage of equity multiplied by the total annual sales is equal to or greater than \n$250,000; \n(c) the percentage of equity multiplied by the net income in the year is equal to or greater \nthan $25,000; and \n(d) the percentage of equity multiplied by the net assets at the end of the year is equal to \nor greater than $125,000 [R88]. \nNote: Business Immigration Section has a template available for calculating a Qualifying Canadian \nBusiness. \nNote: In all cases, the entrepreneur must have at least a 1/3 ownership. \n6.14. \nPercentage of equity  \n“Percentage of equity” means \n(a) in respect of a sole proprietorship, 100 per cent of the equity of the sole proprietorship \ncontrolled by a foreign national or their spouse or common-law partner;\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n12 \n(b) in respect of a corporation, the percentage of the issued and outstanding voting shares of the \ncapital stock of the corporation controlled by a foreign national or their spouse or common-law \npartner; and \n(c) in respect of a partnership or joint venture, the percentage of the profit or loss of the \npartnership or joint venture to which a foreign national or their spouse or common-law partner is \nentitled.  \n(pourcentage des capitaux propres) \n6.15. \nQualifying business  \nA “qualifying business” means a business -- other than a business operated primarily for the \npurpose of deriving investment income such as interest, dividends or capital gains -- for which, \nduring the year under consideration, there is documentary evidence of any two of the following: \n(a) the percentage of equity multiplied by the number of full time job equivalents is equal to or \ngreater than two full-time job equivalents per year; \n(b) the percentage of equity multiplied by the total annual sales is equal to or greater than \n$500,000; \n(c) the percentage of equity multiplied by the net income in the year is equal to or greater than \n$50,000; and \n(d) the percentage of equity multiplied by the net assets at the end of the year is equal to or \ngreater than $125,000 [R88]. \n(entreprise canadienne admissible) \n6.16. \nQualifying Canadian business  \nA “qualifying Canadian business” means a business operated in Canada by an entrepreneur -- \nother than a business operated primarily for the purpose of deriving investment income, such as \ninterest, dividends or capital gains -- for which there is in any year within the period of three years \nafter the day the entrepreneur becomes a permanent resident documentary evidence of any two \nof the following: \n(a) the percentage of equity multiplied by the number of full-time job equivalents is equal to or \ngreater than two full-time job equivalents per year; \n(b) the percentage of equity multiplied by the total annual sales is equal to or greater than \n$250,000; \n(c) the percentage of equity multiplied by the net income in the year is equal to or greater than \n$25,000; and \n(d) the percentage of equity multiplied by the net assets at the end of the year is equal to or \ngreater than $125,000 [R88]. \n(entreprise canadienne admissible)  \nSee definition in R88 and Appendix C for minimum requirements. \n7. \nProcedure: Monitoring entrepreneurs: General guidelines \nOfficers at inland CICs are responsible for monitoring entrepreneurs and assessing compliance \nwith conditions, with the assistance of regional business immigration program specialists and \nBusiness Immigration, Selection Branch, at NHQ.  \nThe following procedural guidelines cover:\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n13 \n• \nforms to be used by the entrepreneur, section 7.1; \n• \nforms to be completed by the officer, section 7.2; \n• \nmonitoring compliance, section 7.3; \n• \nclient contact with an officer, section 7.4; \n• \nhow the Entrepreneur Monitoring Information System (EMIS) is used, section 7.5; \n• \ndocumenting entrepreneur cases: first steps, section 7.6; and \n• \nprocessing the mail-in card, section 7.7 \n7.1. \nForms to be used by the entrepreneur \nThe kit titled “Entrepreneur Counselling and Monitoring Guide” includes:  \n1. Entrepreneur Counselling and Monitoring Guide (IMM 5348E); \n2. Mail-in Card for Entrepreneurs (IMM 5215B); \n3. Entrepreneur Monitoring Guide, IRPA (IMM 5486B); \n4. Application to Cancel Conditions - Entrepreneur (IMM 5344B). \n7.2. \nForms to be completed by the officer  \n• \nEntrepreneur Monitoring Checklist (IMM 5164B) \n• \nA44(1) report. \n7.3. \nMonitoring compliance \nNote: The onus is on the entrepreneur to provide evidence of compliance.  \nIn order to determine if the conditions have been met, the officer should ask the entrepreneur to \naddress how the business satisfies each element of the conditions.  \nThe transition provisions require that entrepreneurs selected under the 1978 Regulations meet \nthe conditions prescribed by those Regulations. Entrepreneurs selected under IRPA will have to \nmeet the \"qualifying Canadian business.\". \nSee definition of \"qualifying Canadian business\" in section 6.16 above. \n7.4. \nClient contact with an officer \nAn entrepreneur, or representative, must contact an officer by: \n• \nmail-in card; \n• \ntelephone; \n• \nletter; \n• \nfax; \n• \nin-person visit; or\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n14 \n• \na representation to the Minister or NHQ. \n7.5. \nHow the Entrepreneur Monitoring Information System (EMIS) is used \nEMIS is used to identify and monitor entrepreneurs. EMIS contains application and permanent \nresidence information on every entrepreneur admitted to Canada. Some of the information in \nEMIS is downloaded from the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) and \nthe Field Operational Support System (FOSS), on a monthly basis. \nInland CICs should contact the EMIS Coordinator, Business Immigration Division, Selection \nBranch, Ottawa, to obtain a copy of the EMIS User Guide, to ascertain the name of the EMIS \nteam representative (or Business Immigration program specialist) in their region, or to request a \ntraining session. The EMIS Coordinator can also confirm that staff have the current version of \nEMIS installed on their desktops. \nTable 5 shows how EMIS is used by inland CICs, regional Business Immigration program \nspecialists, the Business Immigration Division, Selection Branch, Ottawa, and the provinces. \nTable 5: How EMIS is used \nDesignated personnel \nFunction performed/System usage   \nStaff at inland immigration offices \n• \nManually enter monitoring, business \ninformation and enforcement activity into \nEMIS, except in smaller CICs that do not \nhave access to EMIS (Business Immigration \nDivision staff enter data for them). \n• \nMonitor an entrepreneur's compliance with \ntheir conditions of permanent residence. \nBusiness Immigration program specialists \n• \nUse EMIS for statistical analysis. \nBusiness Immigration Division, Selection \nBranch, NHQ \n• \nPerform data entry for smaller CICs that do \nnot have access to EMIS. \nSignificant data include: \n• \nthe amount of money invested in \na Canadian business; \n• \njobs created, jobs retained; and \n• \nthe number of entrepreneurs who \nhave complied with the conditions \nof permanent residence. \nEMIS Coordinator \n• \nContact person for CIC, regional officials and \nthe provinces. \n• \nShare information with the provinces under the \nterms of a negotiated agreement or MOU. \n• \nCD-ROMs are shipped on a monthly basis to \nthose provinces that have entered into \nagreements. \nProvinces \n• \nUse the information to contact entrepreneurs, \npromote their province and provide counselling.\n• \nUse the information for statistical analysis.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n15 \nNote: The automated information is normally kept for eight years. EMIS currently contains the records \nof entrepreneurs granted permanent residence from January 1, 1994, to date. \n7.6. \nDocumenting entrepreneur cases: first steps \nThe following steps should be completed: \n• \ncheck FOSS and update if necessary; \n• \ncreate a file, or update an existing one; \n• \nrequest a file transfer if the entrepreneur was destined to another region; \n• \nupdate EMIS or complete an Entrepreneur Monitoring Checklist (EMC - IMM 5164B - \navailable on CIC Explore);  \n• \nforward the completed EMC (IMM 5164B) to the EMIS Coordinator in Business Immigration \nDivision, Selection Branch;  \n• \nrecord on file details of any consultations with others or contact with the client; and \n• \nbring forward the file for the next monitoring period. \n7.7. \nProcessing the mail-in card [R98(5)(a)] \nThe entrepreneur must send the mail-in card to the local inland CIC identified in the monitoring kit \nwithin six months from the date of granting of permanent residence, providing contact information. \nWhen mail-in cards are received, the officer should review the mail-in card for proper completion \nas follows: \n• \nBox 1 identifies the entrepreneur. \n• \nBox 5 identifies residential address. A post office box or the address of a consultant is not \nsufficient.  \n• \nBox 9 shows the signature of the entrepreneur; not a representative. \nIf the mail-in card is properly completed, the officer should:  \n• \ncreate or update client's file; \n• \nupdate EMIS or complete an Entrepreneur Monitoring Checklist (EMC) and forward it to the \nEMIS Coordinator in the Business Immigration Division, Selection Branch (SSM); \n• \nupdate FOSS; and \n• \nacknowledge, in writing, receipt of the mail-in card (see Appendix B). The \nacknowledgement may be in the form of a welcoming letter from the CIC office to ensure \nthat contact is established with the entrepreneur.  The welcome letter may also provide \nadditional information about the program, conditions, provincial information, and contact \ninformation that may be useful for the entrepreneur.  \nIf the mail-in card is incomplete, the officer should \n• \nretain it on the file and request the missing information in writing;\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n16 \n• \nverify with the entrepreneur that the address on the card is a residential address. If not, \nobtain the proper address and update the client's file. A business address, if available, \nshould be recorded;  \n• \nupdate EMIS or complete an Entrepreneur Monitoring Checklist (EMC) and forward it to the \nEMIS Coordinator in the Business Immigration Division, Selection Branch (SSM). \n8. \nProcedure: Monitoring and reporting \nThe following sections outline requirements and procedures for monitoring and reporting.  \nThe client is invited to the CIC office to attend a counselling session and report on their progress \ntoward meeting the terms and conditions. There are two main reporting periods to monitor:  \n• \nthe first, within six months from the granting of permanent residence; \n• \nthe second, between 18 and 24 months from this same granting date. \nFirst monitoring period: Six months \nAfter processing the mail-in card, the officer should request an interview with the entrepreneur.  A \nletter should be sent to the entrepreneur explaining the reason for the interview and outlining what \nthe interview is intended to do. The interview will allow CIC to counsel the client on the the terms \nand conditions of the program. It will provide the client with feedback on progress to date and \ninformation about the services that are offered by CIC offices as well as various services offered \nby provincial partners. \n \nSecond monitoring period: 18 - 24 months  \n8.1. \nCompleting the Monitoring Report [R98(5)(b)] \nThe CIC office should contact the entrepreneur and request an interview, outlining in the letter the \npurpose of the examination and the type of documentation the client is expected to bring (e.g., a \npassport) to support the claims of compliance with the terms and conditions (see sections 9.4 and \n9.5 below).  \nThe entrepreneur should: \n• \nhave completed research and established a qualifying Canadian business;  \n• \nreport to a CIC or any other place specified in writing by an officer, between 18 and 24 \nmonths from the date permanent residence was granted, providing evidence of efforts to \ncomply with the conditions imposed; \n• \nprovide documentary evidence of: \n♦ administrative information on the business; \n♦ ownership particulars; \n♦ business sector information; \n♦ operations - how the business is being run; \n♦ financial details;\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n17 \n♦ status of ownership, role, and incremental employment. \nThe officer should: \n• \nprovide entrepreneurs with feedback on their progress in complying with the conditions; \n• \ncounsel the entrepreneur accordingly if their efforts are unlikely to meet conditions or if the \nentrepreneur seems reticent to start or continue a business; \n• \ncaution the entrepreneur that failure to comply with all of the conditions within the three-\nyear statutory period may result in enforcement action;  \n• \ndocument all efforts to comply on the client's file;  \n• \nupdate EMIS or complete an Entrepreneur Monitoring Checklist (EMC) and forward it to the \nEMIS Coordinator in the Business Immigration Division, Selection Branch. \n8.2. \nAddressing outstanding conditions \nIf there are conditions still not met after the three-year period, the officer should: \n• \nrequest the entrepreneur to report to the CIC as soon as feasible to determine if the \nconditions have been satisfied; \n• \nif conditions have not been satisfied, assess the efforts the entrepreneur has made to \nsatisfy them and determine whether there are any extenuating circumstances contributing \nto the entrepreneur's failure to comply. \nIf contact information is not available, the officer should check FOSS and proceed as follows: \n• \nenter a \"Watch-for\" (code 01) on the FOSS Status Entry - NCB screen, to be retained on \nFOSS for a minimum of five years or until the entrepreneur has been located (whichever \ncomes first). It should read: \n\"Entrepreneur with outstanding conditions - obtain current Canadian address and \ntelephone number - update FOSS - request to report at the nearest CIC within one week.\" \n• \nprepare an A44(1) report and recommend inquiry action; \n• \nupdate EMIS or complete an EMC and forward it to the EMIS Coordinator in the Business \nImmigration Division, Selection Branch.  This action will complete the file until the \nentrepreneur is detected through the FOSS \"Watch-for\" or voluntarily reports. \n8.3. \nTracing entrepreneurs \nIf the entrepreneur does not contact a CIC, the officer should: \n• \nattempt to locate the entrepreneur in order to provide counselling and to review the \nenforcement implications. The following sources may assist in locating entrepreneurs: \n♦ CRS (Citizenship Registration System); \n♦ local telephone directory; \n♦ Internet;\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n18 \n♦ telephone company information services; \n♦ provincial counterpart; \n♦ motor vehicle bureau; \n♦ credit bureau checks; \n♦ Canada Post tracer system; \n♦ city hall property registration; \n• document all efforts to locate entrepreneurs on the client's file;  \n• update EMIS or complete an EMC;  \n• forward EMC to the EMIS Coordinator in the Business Immigration Division, Selection \nBranch.  \n9. \nProcedure: Compliance with conditions in R98 \nEntrepreneurs are required to comply with the following conditions: \n(a) the entrepreneur must control a percentage of the equity of a qualifying Canadian business \nequal to or greater than 33 1/3 per cent; \n(b) the entrepreneur must provide active and ongoing management of the qualifying Canadian \nbusiness; and \n(c) the entrepreneur must create at least one incremental full-time job equivalent in the qualifying \nCanadian business for Canadian citizens or permanent residents, other than the entrepreneur \nand their family members. \n9.1. \nProof of ownership of a qualifying Canadian business \nFor further information about what constitutes a qualifying Canadian business please see the \nfollowing definitions: \n• \nownership of a qualifying Canadian business, section 6.13 above;  \n• \nqualifying business [R88], section 6.15 above;  \n• \nqualifying Canadian business [R88], section 6.16 above; and  \n• \nAppendix B: The minimum requirements for a qualifying Canadian business. \n9.2. \nProof of a minimum of one-third (1/3) ownership \nFor further information about what constitutes a minimum one-third ownership, please see the \ndefinition of “ownership of a qualifying Canadian business”, section 6.13 above. \n9.3. \nProof of providing full-time employment \nFor further information about what constitutes full-time employment, please see the definition of \n“full-time job equivalent” in section 6.7 above.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n19 \n9.4. \nEvidence accepted for proof of active and ongoing management \nAn entrepreneur may provide the following as evidence of active and ongoing management and \nownership: \n• \ncity/municipal business licences (registration); \n• \ntrade licences \n• \nvendor's permits \n• \nbusiness incorporation documents; \n• \npartnership agreements; \n• \nloan/business agreements; \n• \nagreements of sale and purchase; \n• \narticles of incorporation; \n• \nshareholder's report and minute book; \n• \nshareholder's certificates; \n• \nfinancial statements; \n• \nfederal/provincial sales tax licences (GST & PST registration numbers); \n• \nCanada Revenue Agency taxation number (RCT No.); \n• \ncancelled cheques; \n• \nlease or ownership of a business premise(s); \n• \nreceipts and invoices for equipment, leasehold improvements, vehicles, and inventory; \n• \nstatement of net worth; \n• \ndeeds, land registrations, etc.; \n• \ninsurance policies; \n• \n photos of the interior and exterior of the business. \nFor more information, please see the definition of “active and ongoing management” in section \n6.1 above. \n9.5. \nEvidence accepted for proof of management \nThe entrepreneur may provide the following supporting evidence to demonstrate that they are \nmanaging the business: \n• \nletters from partners attesting to the entrepreneur's role and responsibilities;\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n20 \n• \nevidence of business contracts, registrations and purchase orders signed by the \nentrepreneur; \n• \nbusiness correspondence signed by the entrepreneur; \n• \npartnership agreements; and \n• \nproof of involvement in significant business decisions (e.g., a major role in hiring of \nemployees). \nNote: If the officer is unable to assess the entrepreneur's role in the management of the business from \nthe evidence presented, an interview or on-site visit may be appropriate. \nFor further information please see Appendix C - Management and control of qualifying Canadian \nbusiness. \n10. \nProcedure: Reviewing the monitoring report \nThe officer should: \n• \ndetermine whether a counselling interview is needed; \n• \ndetermine whether a site visit is appropriate; \n• \ninform the entrepreneur of the assessment and clearly state concerns, giving them an \nopportunity to respond to concerns, and specify place, date and time for the next interview, \nif required; \n• \nrefer the entrepreneur to provincial officials or to agencies willing to assist; \n• \nupdate EMIS or complete an EMC;  \n• \nforward EMC to EMIS Coordinator in the Business Immigration Division, Selection Branch.  \n10.1. \nSample questions for assessing entrepreneur's role in the business \nThe following sample questions may be helpful in assessing the entrepreneur's role in the \nbusiness: \n• \nWhere is the location of your business? \n• \nWhat is the nature of the business? \n• \nOver what period did the business operate? \n• \nWhat is the legal structure of the business? \n• \nIs your business incorporated/registered?  \n• \nDo you have partners? \n• \nAre you an officer, director or sole proprietor or do you have some other arrangement? \n• \nWhen was the business formally established?\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n21 \n• \nWhen did the business commence active operations? \n• \nHow much did you invest in the business? \n• \nDoes your business have any municipal or trade licences? \n• \nIs the business listed in trade publications, advertisements, etc.?  \n• \nAre you licensed to collect PST and GST? \n• \nHow often does your company remit payments for employer health tax, worker's \ncompensation, GST, PST, CPP, EI, income tax, etc.? \n• \nDo you have full control over your business? If so, have you delegated decision-making \nresponsibilities to subordinates? \n• \nWhat is your formal participation in management decisions? \n• \nDo you share in residual profits? \n• \nDo you determine your own remuneration (salary/draws)? \n• \nDo you have signing authority on bank accounts? \n• \nWhat banking arrangements have been made - commercial accounts, lines of credit? \n• \nAre there dedicated premises, staff, financing for the business? \n• \nAre you responsible for the day-to-day operations? \n• \nWhat are your plans for the future of the business? \n• \nDo you have direct supervision of employees? \n• \nAre you supervised in any way? \n• \nDid you leave Canada during the time you ran the business? \n• \nDid you have other income during the period you ran the business (in particular \nemployment income)? \nNote: The Canada Revenue Agency requires corporations to file their tax returns within six months of \nthe end of each taxation (fiscal) period. \n10.2. \nAfter compliance with conditions \nIf the entrepreneur can furnish evidence of compliance with all of the elements of the conditions, \nthey should submit an Application to Cancel Conditions (IMM 5344B).  \nThe officer must then approve or refuse the application.  \n10.3. \nResidency Requirement: \nAs a best practice and to ensure fairness, it is recommended that the officer is required to advise \nthe entrepreneur before the examination (on whether terms and conditions had been met) that the\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n22 \nofficer had information that the applicant had not met the residency requirement under A28. At the \nvery least the officer should advise the applicant beforehand that the examination( (on terms and \nconditions) will also include a determination of whether residency requirements have been met. \nThis would give the applicant notice of any concerns the officer may have about compliance with \nresidency requirements and enable them to address these concerns at the examination and make \nany submissions including any relevant considerations regarding humanitarian and \ncompassionate factors / best interests of the child that might overcome any alleged breach of \nthese residency requirements. \nThe CIC officer carrying out an examination on whether an entrepreneur has met the terms and \nconditions and (if connected to this determination) whether residency requirements were also \nmet, will have to inform a CBSA officer of the applicant’s failure to meet these admissibility \nrequirements by writing an A44 report. \n11. \nProcedure: Processing an Application to Cancel Conditions \nAn entrepreneur who has provided evidence of compliance with conditions should submit an \nApplication to Cancel Conditions (IMM 5344B). \nThe officer should:  \n• \nreview the application; \n• \ninform the entrepreneur of the decision.  \nIf the application is approved, the entrepreneur will require proof that conditions are cancelled.  \nNote: This proof will facilitate procedures should the entrepreneur re-enter Canada or apply for \ncitizenship. It will also give the entrepreneur the assurance that they have satisfied the conditions. \nThe officer should follow these steps: \n• \ncounsel entrepreneurs to: \n♦ complete an Application to Cancel Conditions if they have complied with conditions; \n♦ include any family members who were granted permanent residence with conditions. \n• \nreview the application; \n• \nrequest any documentation or information that may be necessary for the purpose of \nassessing the application; \n• \nreview the application and determine if further information is required in order to assess the \napplication;  \n• \nif so, request it in writing, specifying a reasonable deadline for receipt of this information. \nIf no response is received, the officer: \n• \nshould send a follow-up letter and caution the entrepreneur that failure to furnish evidence \nof compliance could result in refusal of the application and possible enforcement action;  \n• \nmay request that the applicant appear for an interview.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n23 \n11.1. \nApproval of an application \nAn officer may approve an application to cancel the conditions if an entrepreneur has satisfied the \nconditions of permanent residence. \nIf the conditions have not been satisfied, the officer should consider whether the entrepreneur has \nmade substantial, verifiable efforts to comply and if there are any extenuating circumstances. The \nofficer should consider all the facts of the case and request additional supporting evidence as \ndeemed necessary. \nThe officer should document in writing on the file the decision to approve the application and the \nassessment of the compliance with the conditions and any extenuating circumstances. \n11.2. \nCancelling the conditions \nThe officer should: \n• \nconfirm in writing that the conditions have been cancelled (see Appendix D);  \n• \nupdate FOSS; \n• \nupdate EMIS to indicate the final decision or complete an EMC and forward it to the EMIS \nCoordinator at NHQ; \n• \nclose the file. \n11.3. \nRefusal of an application \nIf an officer refuses an application before the expiry of the compliance period, the officer should: \n• \nadvise the entrepreneur to reapply for consideration at a later date;  \n• \nprepare a report if the entrepreneur has not satisfied the conditions and there is sufficient \nevidence to support non-compliance;  \nNote: Refer to the ENF 5 Manual for further procedures on preparing 44 reports. \n• \ndocument the decision to refuse the application, in writing, on the file as well as the \nassessment with respect to compliance with the conditions and any extenuating \ncircumstances; \n• \nupdate EMIS.  \n12. \nProcedure: Enforcement process: Reports required \nAn officer should prepare a report in the case of an entrepreneur who does not comply with \nconditions [A44(1)]. A report is required in the following cases: \n• \nwhere any of the reporting requirements were not met; \n• \nwhere the business conditions were not met and the three-year period has expired;  \n• \nwhere information is available that an entrepreneur obtained permanent residence by \nmisrepresentation [A40(1)(a)].\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n24 \nNote: Any other violations such as criminal convictions, before or after permanent residence, must be \nreported as appropriate. \nThe officer may delay preparing the report until sufficient positive information (as opposed to \nmerely the lack of information) has been gathered to indicate that any of the conditions have not \nbeen met. Once this information has been gathered, however, a report must be made \nIf it is determined that an entrepreneur is making efforts to comply with the business conditions, \nbut is late in reporting, the officer will record the violation(s) on the file. After final assessment of \nthe case at the end of the three-year period, this violation and any others should be included in a \nreport. \n \nWriting A44 reports for non-compliance for residency. \nThe Admissibility Branch advises that officers may write A44 reports when they have information \nleading them to believe that, on a balance of probabilities, the entrepreneur has not complied with \nresidency obligations. See section 10.3 above. \n12.1. \nEntrepreneurs indicating non-compliance after first reporting period  \nIf, at any time after the first reporting period (18-24 months), an entrepreneur indicates that they \nhave no intention of complying with the conditions, the officer should: \n• \nhave the entrepreneur complete a statutory declaration. The declaration should confirm the \nentrepreneur's status, acknowledge the conditions imposed, confirm that the entrepreneur \ndoes not intend to comply with the business conditions and the relevant reasons;  \n• \nprovide counselling, as the entrepreneur may, before the three-year period expires, decide to \nestablish a business;  \n• \nprepare a report stating that the entrepreneur has knowingly failed to comply with the \ncondition to show evidence of efforts to comply during the particular reporting period. \nThe preparation of the report may be delayed for some months after the three-year period expires \nwithout prejudicing the case. The report would be based on the fact that the entrepreneur has not \nestablished a satisfactory business within the three-year period. \n12.2. \nReport for entrepreneurs who have left Canada without relinquishing their Confirmation of \nPermanent Residence \nIn cases where a business has not been established, the entrepreneur has left Canada without \nrelinquishing their Confirmation of Permanent Residence and the person's whereabouts are \nknown, the officer should complete a report and recommend referral to an admissibility hearing. \n12.3. \nProcedures before completing the report \nBefore completing a report, an officer should: \n• \ncheck FOSS for information regarding the entrepreneur; \n• \nverify EMIS for the entrepreneur's present location;  \nNote: If EMIS is not available, the officer should contact the EMIS Coordinator at the Business \nImmigration Division, Selection Branch. \n• \nverify with the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) or with local police officials in order \nto determine if the entrepreneur has been convicted of any criminal offences or if there are \nany outstanding charges;\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n25 \n• \nif a business has been set up, conduct an on-site visit to verify its operation. \nIf a recommendation for an admissibility hearing is appropriate, the officer should: \n• \nattempt to locate the entrepreneur; \n• \nif successful, arrange an interview to discuss all aspects of the case; \n• \nrequest that the person complete a statutory declaration on their understanding of the \nconditions imposed and whether these were respected; \n• \nif, after the interview, a recommendation for an admissibility hearing is still appropriate, advise \nthe entrepreneur that a report will be prepared and the case referred for a final decision; \n• \nprovide the entrepreneur with a copy of the report. \nIf the entrepreneur cannot be interviewed, and if sufficient evidence is on file to support the \ncontravention, the officer will prepare a report in absentia. \nOfficers should evaluate each case on its own merits. \n12.4. \nHow to complete the A44(1) report \nOfficers should complete the report as follows: \n• \nrefer to the ENF 5 manual;  \n• \nstate the facts and support each element of the allegations with evidence.  \nTable 5: Evidence required for each of the case elements \nCase elements \nEvidence required \nPermanent resident \nConfirmation of Permanent Residence \nNot a Canadian citizen \nConfirmation from Citizenship \nConditions imposed \nConditions acknowledged and agreed to in \nsigned letter at visa office prior to visa issuance \nConditions contravened \nMay include: \n• \nstatutory declaration of officer reporting on \ninterview or on-site visit; \n• \nstatement of entrepreneur; \n• \nbusiness records; \n• \neconomic information from the province or \nother source. \n \nThe officer must have sufficient evidence to establish the allegations without relying on the \ntestimony of the entrepreneur or other witnesses.  \n12.5. \nInformation required in the body of the report \nThe officer should use the FOSS codes for the appropriate section of the legislation. The \n\"Remarks\" portion should include:  \n• \na statement that the entrepreneur is not a Canadian citizen;\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n26 \n• \nthe date and place permanent residence was granted; \n• \nthe conditions that were contravened; \n• \nhow the conditions were contravened; and \n• \nany reportable convictions determined from CPIC or local police. \n12.6. \nReporting allegations \nThe officer should include all the allegations for which a member of the Immigration Division might \nreasonably find the person described. As a report requires only that the officer have information \n\"indicating\" that the person is described, overwhelming proof is not required.  \n12.7. \nHow to complete Part II - the narrative (highlights) report  \nThe officer should complete a narrative memorandum (highlights report) to accompany the report.  \nNote: The officer should refer to local/regional procedures for the form to be used. The information on \nboth forms must be typewritten. \nThe report should include an analysis of all the circumstances in support of the recommendation \nfor or against an admissibility hearing. Information on the following should be included: \n• \nthe conditions which were contravened; \n• \nefforts, if any, to establish, purchase or invest in a satisfactory business; \n• \ndegree of compliance achieved; \n• \nreasons for failure to comply; \n• \nany counselling provided; \n• \nany information from provincial authorities; \n• \ndetails of assessment overseas/CAIPS notes; \n• \ninformation obtained from other sources, e.g., on-site visits; \n• \nreasons for significant delay in submitting the report after the expiry of the three-year period, if \nrelevant; and \n• \nany other mitigating circumstances. \nNote: With the exception of the rationale section, the information in the highlights report should be \nobjective and factual and not be slanted in favour of a decision one way or the other.  \nThis highlights report should reflect any concerns over the accuracy of the information obtained. \nEvidence which is uncovered during investigation may diminish the credibility of statements made \nby the entrepreneur. \nIt is important that all the allegations of the case be explained and supported by the necessary \nbackground documents. Officers should always attach the best available document, originals if \npossible, or certified true copies.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n27 \nIf the entrepreneur cannot be located or does not agree to be interviewed, indicate in the narrative \nthe reasons the interview was not conducted and outline the steps taken to locate the person. \nNote: The officer must complete an A44(1) report for each of the family members, as they are subject to \nthe principal applicant fulfilling their conditions. Only one narrative report is needed. It should include \nthe case history of all the family members. \nOfficers should refer to local/regional procedures on forwarding the narrative report and the \nA44(1) report to management for review.  \n12.8. \nRecommendations for or against an admissibility hearing \nThe report may recommend an admissibility hearing for the following reasons: \n• \nNon-Compliance with business conditions: consider whether the entrepreneur made \nsubstantial, verifiable efforts to comply and the degree of compliance achieved.  \n• \nPossible misrepresentation: request information from the visa office as soon as possible to \nassist in determining whether there has been any misrepresentation on the application for \npermanent residence (overseas files may be destroyed three years from the date of visa \nissuance). \n• \nLack of compliance and limited efforts to comply: if three years have elapsed, the \nentrepreneur has not complied with the requirements and it is clear that the person had \nopportunities to establish or purchase a business, but did not make reasonable efforts to do \nso.  \nNote: The officer may recommend against an admissibility hearing in the A44 report, in cases where the \nconditions were only partially met, but where entrepreneurs have acted in good faith and have made \nreasonable efforts to meet the conditions but did not succeed for reasons beyond their control.  \nAs with any report, all the circumstances of the case are to be considered. Negative factors such \nas criminal activity, misrepresentation, reliance on public assistance, extended absences from \nCanada which are unrelated to the business, or bad faith in dealing with the Department may \nwarrant referral to an admissibility hearing in a borderline case. Mitigating factors may result in a \npositive decision in a case where an admissibility hearing would otherwise have been directed. \n12.9. \nDelegation of authority \nOfficers should enclose a copy of all the evidence available for use at the admissibility hearing \nwith the report when it is submitted to the delegated authority. \nOfficers should refer to delegation of authority with respect to referral to an admissibility hearing. \n12.10. Recording and communicating the decision \nThe officer should record the decision in FOSS and EMIS on whether an admissibility hearing is \nwarranted.  \nIf EMIS is not available, the officer should complete an EMC and forward it to the EMIS \nCoordinator.  \n12.11. New information \nWhile the report is under review, an entrepreneur may make additional efforts to comply and \nprovide evidence of same in the hope of influencing the decision on the report. Both favourable or \nunfavourable information may be received from other sources.  \nWhere the information is relevant to the admissibility hearing decision and is not just a \nrepackaging of existing information, it should be forwarded for consideration.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n28 \nAn individual who is facing an admissibility hearing may establish a business after the three-year \nperiod. Although in violation of the conditions, consideration should be given to discontinuing \nenforcement action if it is clear that the entrepreneur is serious about establishing and operating a \nbusiness, as required under the program. \nIf it appears that a business has been set up after the three-year period solely for the purpose of \navoiding the continuation of enforcement action and would not likely continue after the conditions \nwere cancelled, continuing enforcement action would appear warranted. \n12.12. Process when admissibility hearing is recommended after completion of the report  \nIf an admissibility hearing is recommended, officers should: \n• \nenter an NCB lookout on FOSS (if entrepreneur cannot be located); \nIf a referral to an admissibility hearing is signed, officers should: \n• \nattach a brief note to a photocopy of the original IMM 0705B, clearly marked \"Follow-up\" and \nsend it to Citizenship without delay; \n• \ncopy the Business Immigration Branch at NHQ. Responsibility for this will be assigned on a \nregional basis. \n12.13. Process when an admissibility hearing is not recommended  \nIf a referral to an admissibility hearing is not made, officers should: \n• \nnotify Citizenship in writing;  \n• \nadvise the entrepreneur in writing that no removal action will be taken and that their status as \na permanent resident is not affected by their failure to meet conditions. \n12.14. Removal order stays \nIf the Immigration Appeal Board stays a removal order (A66 A68) of a permanent resident in the \nEntrepreneur Class and imposes additional conditions (by virtue of R251), the case is referred \nback to CIC for monitoring.  CIC will then monitor both the entrepreneur conditions and the R251 \nconditions which are imposed as a result of the stay of removal. \nR251 states the following; \nIf the Immigration Appeal Division stays a removal order under paragraph 66(b) of the Act, that \nDivision shall impose the following conditions on the person against whom the order was made: \n(a) to inform the Department and the Immigration Appeal Division in writing in advance of any \nchange in the person's address; \n(b) to provide a copy of their passport or travel document to the Department or, if they do not hold \na passport or travel document, to complete an application for a passport or a travel document and \nto provide the application to the Department; \n(c) to apply for an extension of the validity period of any passport or travel document before it \nexpires, and to provide a copy of the extended passport or document to the Department; \n(d) to not commit any criminal offences; \n(e) if they are charged with a criminal offence, to immediately report that fact in writing to the \nDepartment; and \n(f) if they are convicted of a criminal offence, to immediately report that fact in writing to the \nDepartment and the Division.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n29 \n13. \nProcedure: Monitoring and reporting: Roles and responsibilities \n13.1. \nOfficers \nThe functions of an officer at an inland office may include: \n• \nexamining entrepreneurs who have been referred at the port of entry;

See OP 8, Entrepreneur and Self-\nEmployed. \nEntrepreneur's letter of acknowledgement \nTo Canadian Embassy/High Commission/Consulate in \n[Name of Country] \nReference: File No. B - \nI [name of entrepreneur] have applied for a permanent resident visa as a member of the \nentrepreneur class. \nI intend and have the ability to meet the conditions referred to in section 98 of the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Regulations, namely that, after I become a permanent resident in Canada, I \nmust: \n• \ncontrol a percentage of equity of a qualifying Canadian business equal to or greater than 33 \n1/ 3 percent; \n• \nprovide active and ongoing management of the qualifying Canadian business;  \n• \ncreate at least one incremental full-time job equivalent in the qualifying Canadian business for \nCanadian citizens or permanent residents, other than for myself or my family members;  \n• \nmeet these conditions for a period of at least one year within a period of three years after I \nbecome a permanent resident; \n• \nprovide to an officer evidence of compliance with the conditions within the period of three \nyears after the day I become a permanent resident; \n• \nprovide to an officer, not later than six months after the day I become a permanent resident, \nmy residential address and telephone number; and during the period beginning 18 months \nafter and ending 24 months after the day I become a permanent resident, evidence of my \nefforts to comply with these conditions. \nI also acknowledge and understand that all of my family members are subject to the condition that \nI meet the above conditions.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n32 \n \nAppendix \nB  \nThe minimum requirements for a qualifying Canadian \nbusiness \nThe minimum requirements to be met by a qualifying Canadian business for the purpose of \nremoving conditions vary based on the degree of ownership. \nThe following chart sets out the minimum requirements, in increments, for a qualifying Canadian \nbusiness. The entrepreneur must provide acceptable documentary proof of meeting two of the \nfour attributes in the chart. The total of the applicant's and spouse's ownership should be reflected \nin the calculation. \n \nOwnership \nAttribute 100% \n90% \n80% \n70% \n60% \n50% \n40% \n33 1/ 3% \nJobs \n2.00 \n2.22 \n2.50 \n2.86 \n3.33 \n4.00 \n5.00 \n6.00 \nSales \n$ \n250 \n000 \n277 \n778 \n312 \n500 \n357 \n143 \n416 \n667 \n500 \n000 \n625 \n000 \n750 \n000 \nIncome \n$ \n25 \n000 \n27 \n778 \n31 \n250 \n35 \n714 \n41 \n667 \n50 \n000 \n62 \n500 \n75 \n000 \nAssets \n$ \n125 \n000 \n138 \n889 \n156 \n250 \n178 \n571 \n208 \n333 \n250 \n000 \n312 \n500 \n375 \n000 \n \nNote: All financial amounts are in Canadian dollars. \n \nHow to calculate the minimum requirements \nTo calculate the minimum requirements, officers will take the reciprocal of the ownership \npercentage and multiply it by the jobs amount or sales amount or income amount or assets \namount.  \nOwnership is often expressed as a percentage. \nTo calculate the reciprocal of a percentage, officers will first convert the percentage to a fraction \nand then invert the fraction. \nFor example, if an entrepreneur owned 79% of a company they would own 79/100 of that \ncompany.  The reciprocal is therefore 100/79.   \nWhile a 100% owner has to create $250,000 in sales, someone who owns 79% of a company \nmust create $250,000 X 100/79 or $316,455 in sales. \nSimpler percentages can easily be calculated.  For example, someone with 50% (1/2) ownership \nwould require twice the sales; someone with 33 1/3% (1/3) ownership would require three times \nthe sales. \nThe entrepreneur must also create at least one full-time job equivalent for a Canadian citizen or a \npermanent resident other than the entrepreneur and their family members.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n33 \n \nAppendix \nC  \nManagement and control of qualifying Canadian \nbusiness \nEntrepreneurs must manage and control at least one-third of a \"qualifying Canadian business\" \nover one year. To establish whether a business qualifies, the entrepreneur must provide \nacceptable documentary proof that the business meets any two of the four attributes identified in \nthe following chart. The table demonstrates various percentages of ownership and the required \nattributes. \nOwnership \nAttribute \n100% \n50% \n33.33% \nEmployment \n2 \n4 \n6 \nSales ($) \n250,000 \n500,000 \n750,000 \nNet Income ($) \n25,000 \n50,000 \n75,000 \nEquity ($) \n125,000 \n250,000 \n375,000 \nA minimum of one-third (1/3) ownership is required [R98]. \nThe entrepreneur may establish a sole proprietorship (100%). The entrepreneur may also choose \nto establish a partnership (two or more persons who operate a business as co-owners by \nvoluntary legal agreement). The partnership may be in the form of a general partnership (all \npartners carry on the business as co-owners and all are liable for the business' debts). A limited \npartnership may also be formed (one or more general partners and one or more limited partners, \nhowever, the entrepreneur cannot be one of the limited partners). A third partnership option is a \njoint venture (two or more people form a temporary business). The entrepreneur also has the \noption to form a corporation (liability separate and apart from its owners). If a partnership or \ncorporation is formed, the entrepreneur must have a minimum 1/3 (33 1/3%) ownership. \nEntrepreneurs meet the condition if they: \n• \nform a sole proprietorship (100%), which would meet the definition of control;  \n• \nare a partner, along with their spouse (not including other family members), and their \ncombined ownership is equal to or greater than 33 1/3%. \nExample: A partnership is formed with four individuals. The entrepreneur owns 25%, the spouse owns \n25%, and the remaining 50% is divided between the other two partners. The entrepreneur would meet \nthe requirement - the entrepreneur's 25%, plus 25% from the spouse would be greater than 33 1/3%. \nIf a corporation is formed and shares are issued, the entrepreneur again would be required to \nmeet the minimum ownership requirement. Shares issued to the entrepreneur and the spouse \ncould be combined, but must be equal to or be greater than 33 1/3%. \n \nEmployment \nFull-time job equivalents are used in two completely separate and independent calculations: \n1. \nto calculate whether the percentage of equity multiplied by the number of full-time job \nequivalents is equal to or greater than two full-time job equivalents for the purpose of \ndetermining whether a Canadian business qualifies or not; and \n2. \nto determine whether the entrepreneur has created at least one incremental full-time \njob equivalent for Canadian citizens or permanent residents, other than the \nentrepreneur and their family members.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n34 \nIn each case, full-time job equivalents can be made up of any combination of paid employment, \nwhether full or part-time.  Services provided outside the context of employment (i.e., contracted \nservices, professional fees, etc.) do not qualify.   \nNote: All employers in Canada are required to keep adequate payroll records and produce a paid \nemployment reconciliation in the form of a T-4/T4A Summary.  \nThe calculation for No.1 above includes any paid employment, including the entrepreneur, \nspouse, family members, etc., and is subject to the percentage of equity calculations. \nThe calculation for No. 2 above takes into account only incremental full-time job equivalents for \nCanadian citizens or permanent residents other than the entrepreneur and their family members \nand is not affected by what percentage of equity the entrepreneur controls. In other words,, the \nbusiness must create one incremental full-time job equivalent regardless of what share the \nentrepreneur owns. \nDocumentation to determine employment requirements includes: \n• \npayroll records; \n• \ncancelled payroll cheques (proof of renumeration); \n• \nsource deductions remittances (CPP/EI/income tax); \n• \nyear-end T4/T4A Summary with attached copies of T4s and T4As; \n• \nemployment insurance report on earnings for employees (Record of Employment); \n• \nfinancial statements; \n• \ncompensation, dental and health plans, etc. \n \nSales \nSales may include sales of products or, in the case of the rendering of services, what is more \ncommonly referred to as revenue or gross revenue. \nThe income statement is the primary source for determining sales, but corroborating \ndocumentation can include: \n• \nsales invoices; \n• \nprovincial sales tax returns; \n• \nG.S.T.; and \n• \nfederal and provincial tax returns.\nIP 7 Entrepreneur Program \n2008-06-25 \n \n35 \n \nAppendix \nD  \nConfirmation letters - Terms and conditions met and \ncancelled \nConfirmation letter under 1978 Regulations \nTo: Client's Address \nCIO File Number \nVisa Number \nEMIS Number (if available) \nDear Sir/Madam: \nThis refers to your admission to Canada as a permanent resident under the entrepreneur \ncategory and the monitoring which has been conducted on your business. \nAs you are aware, the following conditions pursuant to sections 23.1(1)(a) to (d) of the former \nImmigration Regulations, 1978 were imposed upon your admission to Canada: \nWithin two years, you must: \n• \nestablish, purchase or make a substantial investment in a business or commercial venture in \nCanada so as to make a significant contribution to the economy and whereby employment \nopportunities in Canada are created or continued for one or more Canadian citizens or \npermanent residents other than yourself and your dependants; \n• \nparticipate actively and on an on-going basis in the management of that business or \ncommercial venture; \n• \nfurnish evidence of efforts to comply with the terms and conditions imposed; and \n• \nreport to the nearest Canada Immigration Centre within a period of not more than two years \nafter the date you obtained permanent resident status to furnish evidence of compliance with \nthe conditions imposed. \nThis letter is to advise you that these conditions imposed upon you, and your family members, for \nadmission to Canada are cancelled.
