50\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n2 \nUpdates to chapter \n \nListing by date: \n \n \n2013-09-04 \nSections 3 and 5 have been updated and Section 7.3 has been added, to reflect \nchanges made to the security inadmissibility and ministerial relief provisions that have \ncome into force following the Royal Assent of the Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals \nAct. The provision on espionage has been amended. The provision on subversion \nagainst any democratic government, institution or process has been established under a \nnew paragraph, namely A34(1)(b.1). Ministerial relief provisions under subsections \nA34(2), A35(2) and A37(2) have been repealed and replaced by section A42.1. \n \n \n2008-08-08 \nChanges were made to ENF 1 at 7.11 to correctly reflect the legislation. \n \n \n2006-07-13 \nChanges were made to chapter ENF 1 to remove references to “omissions” in the \ncontext of criminal inadmissibility. The term, which was contained in the provisions of \nthe former Act, is not contained in the IRPA.   \n \n \n2005-06-27 \nChanges were made to chapter ENF 1 in order to reflect the CIC and CBSA policy \nresponsibility and service delivery roles. \n \nCaselaw was added in Appendix A for cases involving A37(1)(a) and A40. \n \n \n2003-11-25 \nMinor changes were made to chapter ENF 1, entitled Inadmissibility. Section 7.18 and \nSection 7.19 — Security Review changed to Organized Crime Directorate. \n \n \n2003-07-16 \nBoth minor and substantive changes and clarifications have been made throughout \nENF 1 - Inadmissibility. It is recommended that any former version of this chapter be \ndiscarded in favour of the one now appearing in CIC Explore. \n \n \n2003-03-04 \nSection 7.19 has been amended to reflect that the Minister’s representative does not \nhave to prove that the organization is involved in criminal activity (A37(1)(b)).\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n3 \n1. \nWhat this chapter is about \nThis chapter: \n \ndetails the particular inadmissibility provisions of the Immigration and Refugee \nProtection Act (IRPA or the Act) (Division 4 of Part 1); and \n \nprovides functional direction and guidance in applying the inadmissibility provisions \nby giving an analysis of each allegation’s case elements, examples of \nrecommended evidence and, in some cases, a summary of jurisprudence. \n2. \nProgram objectives \nThe objectives of the Canadian immigration legislation relative to the inadmissibility \nprovisions are: \n \nto protect the health and safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of \nCanadian society; \n \nto promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights \nand by denying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals or \nsecurity risks; and \n \nto ensure that decisions taken under the Act are consistent with the Canadian \nCharter of Rights and Freedoms, including its principles of equality and freedom \nfrom discrimination and of the equality of English and French as the official \nlanguages of Canada. \nIn dealings with persons who may be inadmissible to Canada, officers control the \nadmission and/or allow for the presence of persons in Canada by referencing the \nvarious inadmissibility provisions of the IRPA.  \nPart 1, Division 4 of the Act makes distinctions based on categories of inadmissibility \nrelated to: \n \ncriminality; \n \norganized criminality; \n \nsecurity; \n \nhuman or international rights violations; \n \nhealth; \n \nfinancial reasons; \n \nmisrepresentation; \n \nnon-compliance; \n \ninadmissible family members. \n3. \nThe Act and Regulations \nFor information about \nSee \nA permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on security grounds for  \n \nengaging in an act of espionage  that is against Canada or that is contrary to \nCanada’s interests \nA34(1)(a)\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n4 \n \nengaging in or instigating the subversion by force of any government \nA34(1)(b) \n \nengaging in an act of subversion against a democratic government, \ninstitution or process as they are understood in Canada \nA34(1)(b.1) \n \nengaging in terrorism \nA34(1)(c) \n \nbeing a danger to the security of Canada \nA34(1)(d) \n \nengaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety \nof persons in Canada \nA34(1)(e) \n \nbeing a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to \nbelieve engages, has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph \n(a), (b).

In most cases, persons not covered by the regulations may still be \nconsidered described or eligible for a specific relief provision after an assessment of the \nindividual evidence. In this way, the regulations and schedules are not exhaustive but \nwill address the most straightforward cases. \nThe purpose of regulations is to more objectively define criteria for specified allegations. \nThe aim is to increase the objective factor and reduce the subjective factor in the \ndecision-making process through greater codification in the regulations where possible. \nWith improved definition, greater transparency is introduced and outcomes or decisions \nbecome more predictable for some cases. \nReliance on regulations and schedules provides maximum flexibility and retains the \ngovernment’s capacity to respond quickly to environmental or policy shifts. \nThe Act groups regulation-making authority with the sections of the Act to which the \nregulations will be applicable. This makes it clearer, when reading the Act, where \nregulatory authority comes from, as well as its scope, limits and application. \nThe Act requires the Ministers to table any proposed regulations respecting \nexaminations, rights and obligations of permanent and temporary residents, loss of \nstatus and removal, detention and release, refugee eligibility, the pre-removal risk \nassessment, transportation companies and information-sharing before each House of \nParliament for referral to the appropriate Committee of that House. This will allow the \nStanding Committees to provide input into regulations and will strengthen citizens’\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n36 \ncapacity to play an active role in shaping regulations through an open and transparent \nregulatory process. \n(See also Chapter ENF 2, Evaluating Inadmissibility.) \nFor information on writing and reviewing A44 reports, please refer to ENF 5 and ENF 6. \n6. \nDefinitions \nNil. \n7. \nProcedure: For obtaining evidence and determining equivalency \n7.1. \nObtaining evidence for A34(1)(a) \nThe officer may obtain evidence for A34(1)(a) by collecting: \n \npolice or intelligence reports;

Such proof consists of a certified copy of the \nConviction Certificate or the Warrant of Committal. A certified copy of the court \ninformation containing the accusations against the person concerned and indicating \na conviction may also be used; \n \ntext of the Canadian statute to prove that the offence is punishable by a term of \nimprisonment of at least ten years or proof that a term of imprisonment of more than \nsix months was imposed, whichever is applicable; \n \nstatutory declaration – evidence of statements made to an officer; \n \nstatutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or \nan admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has \nbeen convicted of an offence in Canada.

This \nevidence is required to establish equivalence. With respect to the foreign offence, a \nphotocopy of the relevant provision of the foreign law is sufficient. This may be \nobtained from law libraries, embassies, or consulates. The texts must be introduced \ninto evidence at the admissibility hearing so that they will form part of the official \nrecord. It is recognized that not all countries codify their criminal laws in a text of \nstatutes as is done in Canada. In such cases, officers should use their best efforts \nto obtain a legal description of the foreign offence. Such descriptions may be \nobtained from foreign jurisprudence in law libraries or from embassies or \nconsulates. In the absence of such a description, evidence of the facts that led to \nthe conviction may be sufficient to support a finding that the person is described; \n \nin preparation for the admissibility hearing, evidence should be obtained showing \nthat the person concerned has not satisfied the Minister of C&I that they have \nrehabilitated themselves.

Such proof consists of a certified copy of the conviction certificate or the \nwarrant of committal. A certified copy of the court information containing the \naccusations against the person concerned and indicating a conviction may also be \nused; \n \ntext of the Canadian statute setting out the indictable offence or summary \nconvictions of which the person concerned has been convicted; \n \nstatutory declaration - evidence of statements made to an officer; \n \nstatutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or \nan admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has \nbeen convicted of an offence or offences in Canada. If a person is not contesting a \ncriminality allegation, then the person's admission of such criminality which may \ntake the form of a statutory declaration can also constitute sufficient evidence.

To establish that the person concerned is not a Canadian \ncitizen, an admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory \ndeclaration is considered sufficient evidence. A letter from CPC Sydney stating that \nthere is no record that the person concerned is a citizen of Canada is also sufficient. \nTo establish that the person concerned is not a permanent resident of Canada, an \nadmission by the person directly or documented through a statutory declaration is \nconsidered sufficient evidence. A Query Response Centre (QRC), CIC, document \nindicating no confirmation of permanent residence is also sufficient. \n7.15. \nObtaining evidence and determining equivalency for A36(2)(b) \nThe officer may obtain evidence for A36(2)(b) by collecting: \n \nproof of conviction: This is preferable and should be introduced into evidence at the \nadmissibility hearing even if the person concerned concedes the allegation.

In the absence of \nsuch a description, evidence of the facts that led to the conviction may be sufficient \nto support a finding that the person is described; \n \nevidence that the convictions did not arise from the same occurrence (if applicable). \nThis evidence can usually be found in court or police documents setting out the \nfactual background of the offence, such as the court information or the police \nreports; \n \nevidence, where relevant, that the person concerned is not a Canadian citizen or a \npermanent resident. To establish that the person concerned is not a Canadian \ncitizen, an admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory \ndeclaration is considered sufficient evidence. A letter from CPC Sydney stating that \nthere is no record that the person concerned is a citizen of Canada is also sufficient. \nTo establish that the person concerned is not a permanent resident of Canada, an \nadmission by the person directly or documented through a statutory declaration is \nconsidered sufficient evidence. A Query Response Centre (QRC), CIC, document \nindicating no confirmation of permanent residence is also sufficient; \n \nother documentary evidence including, but not limited to, media articles, scholarly \njournals, expert evidence (i.e., evidence from a person who is a specialist in a \nsubject and who may present an “expert” opinion). \nEquivalency can be determined three ways: \n \nby comparison of the precise wording in each statute both through documents and, \nif available, through the evidence of an expert or experts in the foreign law with a \nview to determining the essential ingredients of the respective offences;\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n43 \n \nby examining the evidence adduced before the member of the Immigration Division, \nboth oral and documentary, to ascertain whether or not that evidence was sufficient \nto establish that the essential ingredients of the offence in Canada had been proven \nin the foreign proceedings, whether precisely described in the initiating documents \nor in the statutory provisions in the same words or not; or \n \nby a combination of the two. \n7.16. \nObtaining evidence and determining equivalency for A36(2)(c) \nThe officer may obtain evidence for A36(2)(c) by collecting: \n \nstatutory declaration -  evidence of statements made to an officer; \n \nstatutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or \nan admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has \ncommitted an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was \ncommitted. If a person is not contesting a criminality allegation, then the person's \nadmission of such criminality which may take the form of a statutory declaration can \nalso constitute sufficient evidence; \nNote: Testimony and/or declarations of the person concerned or witnesses: This method of \nestablishing inadmissibility, when used in the absence of documentary evidence, is the least \ndesirable as the person concerned may be unable to recite the details of the offence. \n \nevidence that constitutes “reasonable grounds” that the person concerned \ncommitted prohibited act(s) outside Canada. Evidence may consist of security or \npolice reports, court records, newspaper clippings, or statutory declarations from \nforeign authorities that demonstrate that an offence has been committed, and that \nan arrest warrant is outstanding, that charges are pending and/or that the person \nhas been indicted; \n \nthe text of the foreign legislation and the text of the Canadian legislation to establish \nequivalence. With respect to the foreign offence, a photocopy of the relevant \nprovision of the foreign law is sufficient. This may be obtained from law libraries, \nembassies, or consulates. The texts must be introduced into evidence at the \nadmissibility hearing so that they will form part of the official record. It is recognized \nthat not all countries codify their criminal laws in a text of statutes as is done in \nCanada. In such cases, officers should use their best efforts to obtain a legal \ndescription of the foreign offence. Such descriptions may be obtained from foreign \njurisprudence in law libraries or from embassies or consulates. In the absence of \nsuch a description, evidence of the facts that led to the conviction may be sufficient \nto support a finding that the person is described; \n \nin preparation for the admissibility hearing, evidence should be obtained showing \nthat the person concerned has not satisfied the Minister of C&I that they have \nrehabilitated themselves. Although the person concerned has the onus of proving \nthat the Minister of C&I has approved of their rehabilitation, the officer should \nnevertheless confirm whether such approval has been issued in order to ascertain \nwhether the referral for a hearing should be withdrawn or to counter possible \ntestimony by the person him/herself that rehabilitation approval was issued; \n \nevidence, where relevant, that the person concerned is not a Canadian citizen or a \npermanent resident. To establish that the person concerned is not a Canadian \ncitizen, an admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory \ndeclaration is considered sufficient evidence. A letter from CPC Sydney stating that \nthere is no record that the person concerned is a citizen of Canada is also sufficient. \nTo establish that the person concerned is not a permanent resident of Canada, an \nadmission by the person directly or documented through a statutory declaration is\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n44 \nconsidered sufficient evidence.

Jolly, [1975] F.C. 216, 54 D.L.R. (3d) 277, 7 N.R. 271 \n(Fed.C.A.) \n \nThe question is not will the applicant engage in espionage or subversion or \nterrorism, but whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person \nwill so behave. Even if evidence is given negating this fact, it is only necessary for \nthe Minister to show the existence of reasonable grounds for believing the fact. It is \nnot necessary for the Minister to go further in establishing the subversive character \nof the persons subject to the proceeding. \nKashmiri v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1996), 37 C.R.R. (2d) \n264, 116 F.T.R. 316 (Fed.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 5 Imm. L.R. (3d) 129 \n(Fed. T.D.) \n \n“Subversion” and “espionage” are defined and addressed. \nSuresh v.

C.A.), [2002] S.C.C. 1 \n \nDenying entry to Convention refugees on security grounds is a violation of s. 7 of \nthe Charter, BUT is saved by s. 1. \n \nDenying entry to Convention refugees on security grounds is not a violation of the \nConvention Against Torture, Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the \nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  \n \nIt is permissible for a state to rid itself of those who pose a security risk without \nbeing in breach of its international obligations. \nYamani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (March 14, 2000), Doc. \nIMM-1919-98 (Fed. T.D.) \n \nThe term “subversion” was found to violate s. 7 of the Charter by being too vague \nconstitutionally but the judge then found that s. 1 of the Charter could be used to \nsave the provision so that, in the final analysis, this term was found to be \nconstitutional. \nYamani v. Canada (Solicitor General) (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 191, 129 D.L.R. (4th) \n226, 32 C.R.R. (2d) 295, 103 F.T.R. 105, [1996] 1 F.C. 174 (Fed.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (January 16, 1998), Doc. \nIMM-4523-96 (Fed. T.D.) \n \nThe purpose of A35(1)(b) is to ensure that Canada does not become a haven for \npersons who have engaged in terrorism, systematic or gross human rights \nviolations, war crimes or crimes against humanity. \n \nPersons holding specific positions within a government are deemed to be senior \nmembers of or senior officials in the service of a government for that purpose. To \nobtain a Minister’s acceptance, one would have to demonstrate that, \nnotwithstanding their position, there was no complicity in the objectionable acts of \nthat government. \nHussein v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 41 Imm. L.R. (2d) \n42 (Can. Imm. & Ref. Bd. (App.Div.)) \nRudolph v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) \n442, 91 D.L.R. (4th) 686 (Fed. C.A.) \n \nDouble criminality—paragraph 19(1)(j) of the Immigration Act, 1976, in conjunction \nwith subsection 7(3.6) of the Criminal Code, mandates the notional transfer to \nCanadian soil of the actus reus only and not of the entire surrounding \ncircumstances so as to permit a plea of obedience to de facto foreign state \nauthority. The fact that the German government ordered or condoned the \napplicant’s conduct during WWII is no defence to a charge of doing the same thing \nin Canada. \nA36(1)(a), (b) and (c) \nJurisprudence \nBarnett v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1996), 33 Imm. L.R. (2d) 1, \n109 F.T.R. 154 (Fed. T.D.) \n \nWhere another country, whose legal system is based on similar foundation and \nvalues as our own, has enacted legislation which reflects goals and objectives \nanalogous to those encompassed within our own system, then that law should be \naccorded respect and recognized for purposes of Canadian immigration law. \n \nThe question is not whether Canada has identical legislation in place but whether \nthe underlying rationale of the foreign legislation is consistent with some \nfundamental principle of justice esteemed within our society.\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n52 \n \nA foreign pardon granted under a legal system that reflects goals and objectives \nanalogous to those encompassed within our own should be followed for the \npurpose of Canadian immigration law. \nCanada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Fenner (December 11, 1981), \nDoc. V81-6126 (Imm. App. Bd.) \n \nA foreign legal procedure that is not equivalent to an absolute or conditional \ndischarge will not be treated as such in Canada. The conviction remains for the \npurpose of A36(1). \nDayan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1987), 78 N.R. 134 (Fed. \nC.A.) \n \nTest for equivalency. \n \nReliance on the concept of offences as malum in se to prove equivalency with the \nprovisions of the Canadian Criminal Code is a device that should be resorted to \nonly when, for a very good reason, proof of foreign law has been difficult to make, \nand then only when the foreign law is that of a non-common law country. \nHalm v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1995), 27 C.R.R. (2d) 23, \n91 F.T.R. 106 \n \nEquivalency is not met in the case where the Canadian statute is struck down for \nunconstitutionality. \n \nEquivalency is not required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. All that is \nrequired is that the adjudicator determine that the applicant is a person with respect \nto whom there are “reasonable grounds to believe” that they have been convicted \noutside of Canada of an equivalent offence. \nHill v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1987), 1 Imm. L.R. (2d) 1, 73 \nN.R. 315 (Fed.

App. Bd.) \n \nAlthough the Minister establishes equivalency with a section of the Criminal Code, \nthe Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) is not restricted to the provisions \nselected, but is able to explore various other provisions of Canadian law. \nLegault v. Canada (Secretary of State) (1997), 42 Imm. L.R. (2d) 192, 133 F.T.R. 320 \n(note), 219 N.R. 376 (Fed. C.A.); leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1998), 227 N.R. \n(note) (S.C.C.) \n \n“Reasonable grounds” are enough to show that the applicant falls within A36(1)(b) \nand (c). In this case, a warrant and indictment were sufficient. \nLei v. Canada (Solicitor General) (1994), 74 F.T.R. 67 \n \nIf the Canadian statute is narrower than the foreign equivalent, the adjudicator must \nbe presented with additional evidence surrounding the circumstances to establish\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n53 \nthat the person would have been convicted if the same offence were committed in \nCanada. \nLeung v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (May 3, 2000), Doc. A-283-\n98 (Fed. C.A.) \n \nIt is not incumbent on the visa officer to question the reasonableness of the \nMinister’s decision. \nLui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 39 Imm. L.R. (2d) 60, \n134 F.T.R. 308 (Fed. T.D.) \n \nThe following test must be used when determining equivalency (for convictions or \npardons) between Canadian and foreign law: \n the laws and legal system of the foreign jurisdiction must be similar to those of \nCanada; \n the foreign law in question must be similar in (a) aim or purpose; (b) content; \nand (c) effect, but not necessarily identical to the Canadian law. \nMasasi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 40 Imm. L.R. (2d) \n133, 138 F.T.R. 121 (Fed. T.D.) \n \nWhen establishing equivalency between foreign and Canadian offences, it is \nnecessary to establish the essential elements of the offences AND to actually \nexamine them in order to determine whether they were equivalent or not. \nMohammad v.

C.A.) \n \nIt is not a precondition that the Minister shall have considered the question of \nrehabilitation. The fact that a person described in A36 does not possess proof of \nsatisfaction of the Minister is sufficient evidence for inadmissibility. \n \nThe immigration officer is not required to give the person concerned an opportunity \nto answer allegations contained in that report. \n \nThere are no problems of institutional independence because the adjudication \ndivision and the [hearings] officers are separate divisions that do not provide or take \nadvice to/from the other. \nR. v. Wardley (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 345 (Ont. C.A.) \n \nIf the person is charged with an indictable offence and pleads guilty to an included \noffence, then the plea constitutes a plea of guilty to the indictable offence and the \nmaximum sentence for the conviction of the indictable offence governs with respect \nto penalty. \nRobertson v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1979] 1 F.C. 197, 43 \nC.C.C. (2d) 354, 91 D.L.R. (3d) 93 (Fed. C.A.) \n \nThe person can be deported under A36 only if the maximum punishment is 10 \nyears’ imprisonment at the date of the deportation order. If it was 10 years (or more) \nbut has since been reduced, then the person cannot be deported under A36. \nSaini v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 184 D.L.R. (4th) 568 \n(Fed. T.D.) \n \nAn officer cannot ignore a valid pardon given in another country with a similar \njustice system. \nSingleton v.

C.A.)\nENF 1 Inadmissibility \n 2013-09-04 \n \n54 \n \nLack of a certificate of the applicant’s conviction leaves something to be desired in \nthe particularity of the evidence, however, it will not automatically result in the \napplicant’s entry into Canada. \nSmith v.

T.D.) \n \nA valid deportation or exclusion order may not be enforced after a record \nsuspension has been granted for the offence in question: the conviction has been \nrevoked under the Criminal Records Act or there has been a final determination of \nan acquittal. \nSteward v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1988), 84 N.R. 236 \n(Fed. C.A.). \n \nEquivalency can be determined in three ways: \n by comparison of the precise wording in each statute both through documents \nand, if available, through the evidence of an expert or experts in the foreign law \nwith a view to determining the essential ingredients of the respective offences; \n by examining the evidence adduced before the adjudicator, both oral and \ndocumentary, to ascertain whether or not that evidence was sufficient to \nestablish that the essential ingredients of the offence in Canada had been \nproven in the foreign proceedings, whether precisely described in the initiating \ndocuments or in the statutory provisions in the same words or not; or \n by a combination of the two. \nTaei v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1993), 19 Imm. L.R. (2d) 187, \n64 F.T.R. 311 (Fed. T.D.) \n \nA Convention refugee that is later accused of committing an act described in A36(1) \nmay not be granted permanent resident status until the criminal charges are \ndisposed of. \nTaubler v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1981] 1 F.C. 620 (Fed. \nC.A.) \n \nIn the absence of evidence to the contrary, it was presumed that the equivalent \nforeign law involved the element of mens rea and that a conviction indicates that a \nfinding of guilty intent was made. \nTei v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 48 Imm. L.R. (2d) 120, \n161 F.T.R. 51 (Fed.

Due to the fact the \nrespondent was never landed, he was held to never have acquired Canadian \ndomicile. \nCanada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v.
