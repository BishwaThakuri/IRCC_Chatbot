The Minister of \nCitizenship and Immigration [also known as Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada \n(IRCC)] and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PS) are jointly \nresponsible for the administration and enforcement of the IRPA, however there are some \ndifferences. The IRCC Minister is responsible for the overall administration of the IRPA, unless \notherwise specified. The Minister of PS has the primary responsibility for the administration of \nthe IRPA as it relates to the following:  \n \n \nport of entry examinations; \n \npolicy lead relating to enforcement of the IRPA including arrest, detention and \nremoval; \n \nestablishment of policies respecting the enforcement of the IRPA and \ninadmissibility under A34/A35/A35.1/A36(2.1)/A37; and \n \ndeclarations referred to under A42.1 (Ministerial Relief provision) \n \nPursuant to A6(1), the responsible Minister has the authority to designate specific persons or \nclasses of persons to carry out any purpose of any provision of the IRPA with respect to their \nindividual mandate as described in A4, and to specify the powers and duties of the officers so \ndesignated. This is referred to as the designation of authority. In addition, A6(2) authorizes \nthat anything that may be done by the Minister under the Act may be done by a person that the \nMinister authorizes in writing. This is referred to as delegation of authority.   \n \nEach Minister who has responsibilities under the IRPA has written an instrument of delegation \nand designation that is periodically updated. The Delegation of Authority and Designations of \nOfficers (D & D) instruments stipulate who has the authority to perform specific immigration-\nrelated functions. CBSA and IRCC personnel are designated by position to perform all \ndelegated or designated authorities, including those associated with A44(1)/A44(2) functions. It \nis to be noted that the IRPA D & D instruments have a hierarchical link which means only the \nlowest level of authority is included in the D & D instruments as every position above this one \n(with a direct hierarchical link) has the same authority to perform specific immigration-related \nfunctions.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n9 \n \n \nCBSA and IRCC officers should always review both the CBSA and the IRCC D & D instruments \nas they have authorities delegated and designated under both instruments, which can be found \non the IL 3 –  Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority.  \n \nThe authority of an officer to prepare an inadmissibility report under A44(1) has been \ndesignated to certain CBSA and IRCC officials. It is important to note that while IRCC officers \nhave been designated the authority to write reports for most inadmissibility sections, A44(1) \nreports for inadmissibility under A34 (security grounds), A35 (grounds of violating human or \ninternational rights), A35.1 (sanctions) and A37 (grounds of organized criminality) may only be \nprepared and reviewed by CBSA.  \n \nAll reports written by CBSA or IRCC officers will be reviewed by the Minister’s Delegate (MD) \nwho has been delegated the authority under the D & D instruments. If the MD is of the opinion \nthat the report is well-founded, the MD will make the appropriate decision based on the \nevidence and determine whether to:  \n \n \nissue a removal order, if the allegation is within the MD’s authority pursuant to \nR228); or  \n \nrefer the report to the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board  \n(IRB) pursuant to R229. \n \nFor additional information see Appendix F:  Table: Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \n(IRPA) Inadmissible Classes  \n \nNote:  Policy requires that even where officers and officials acting in the capacity of the \nMinister’s Delegate (including chiefs and directors) have the delegated authority under \nthe D & D instruments, they should not perform Minister's Delegate functions and \nreviews until they have successfully completed the necessary training to perform the \nA44(2) function.  This policy is consistent with the Federal Court’s decision in Zhang v. Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 362 where judicial review was granted based on a \nfinding that there was an inadequate record before the court to conclude that the MD had \nreceived the required Minister’s Delegate Review training and was therefore authorized to issue \na removal order.   \n \n \n5 Definitions \n \nAdult legally responsible \nAn adult legally responsible for a minor or suspected incompetent person may be their parent or \nlegal guardian. If the accompanying adult is not a parent or guardian, reasonable efforts must \nbe made to contact a parent or guardian. For more information on accompanying adults, please \nrefer to ENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children. \n \nForeign national \nA person who is not a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident; includes a stateless person \n[A2(1)]. \n \nIndian \nA person who is registered as an Indian under the Indian Act [R2].\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n10 \n \n \nMinor  \nA minor is a person under 18 years of age. Persons claiming to be less than 18 years of age. \nare to be treated as minors unless there is conclusive evidence that they are 18 years old or \nolder.  \n \nPermanent resident \nA person who has acquired permanent residence status and has not subsequently lost that \nstatus under A46 [A2(1)]. \n \nPersons unable to appreciate the nature of proceedings  \nThis phrase refers to persons who are unable to understand the reason for the proceedings or \nwhy they are important, or cannot give meaningful instructions to counsel about their case. An \nopinion regarding competency may be based on the person's own admission, the person's \nobservable behaviour at the proceeding, or an expert opinion on the person's mental health or \nintellectual or physical faculties. Pursuant to R228(4)(b) and R229(4)(b), the authority to issue \nany removal order for persons unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings shall be the \nID.  \n \nProtected person \nA person on whom refugee protection is conferred in Canada and whose claim or application \nhas not subsequently been deemed to be rejected because of cessation or vacation \nproceedings [A95(2)] \n \n \n6 Departmental policy \n \n6.1 Procedural fairness \n \nAll officers involved in the administration and enforcement of the IRPA must consider and weigh \nall the relevant facts and factors before them. All officers are to support the objectives of the \nIRPA by ensuring all decisions taken under the IRPA are consistent with the Canadian Charter \nof Rights and Freedoms (Charter)1 and the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. \n \nThe principles of natural justice exist as a safeguard for individuals in their interactions with the \nstate. These principles stipulate that whenever a person's \"rights, privileges or interests\" are at \nstake, there is a duty to act in a procedurally fair manner. \n \nThis includes, but is not limited to, the individual's rights to the following: \n \n \nknow the case to be met; \n \nhave an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the case; \n \nprovide a response to facts or new information that will be considered by the decision-\nmaker; \n \nreceive notice of decision and reasons for the decision; \n \nhave the evidence fully and fairly considered; \n \nright to impartial decision-maker who is free from bias; and \n \nright to an interpreter where necessary and, where the person is detained, right to \ncounsel. \n                                                \n1 Constitution Act, 1982, PART I\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n11 \n \n \n \nIn general terms, procedural fairness considerations to be applied in each case will be different, \ndepending on a number of factors. The Federal Court has found that the content of the duty of \nfairness in A44 proceedings will vary depending on the nature and circumstances of the \ndecision being made. For example, in Awed v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC \n469, the Court found that where an officer calls a permanent resident or foreign national for an \ninterview in order to confirm facts that would support an A44(1) opinion and report, the content \nof the duty of fairness at the initial stage is minimal. The Court found, however, that such a \ndegree of fairness requires that the officer advise the person of the purpose of the interview so \nthat the person is put on notice of the possible consequences and has an opportunity to make \nmeaningful submissions. In Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. \nCha, 2006 FCA 126, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) found that it was open to the Federal \nCourt judge to find that the officer had breached the duty of fairness in failing to inform the \napplicant of the possible consequences of the initial A44(1) interview, however the FCA \ndisagreed with the Federal Court’s conclusion that section A44 determinations call for a \nrelatively high degree of participatory rights in respect of persons who are inadmissible on \ngrounds of serious or simple criminality in Canada, as officers and MDs are simply on a fact-\nfinding mission at the A44 stage.  \n \nIt is important for officers to differentiate those cases where the MD may issue a removal order \nand those cases where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order lies with the ID, as different \nprocedural requirements and considerations will apply in order to ensure that procedural \nfairness and natural justice are met.  \n \nThe spectrum of procedural fairness will also depend on the status of the person concerned and \nadditional considerations will apply for permanent residents and protected persons (See section \n8, ‘Considerations before writing an A44(1) Report- Scope of officer discretion’; section 9.2, \n‘Special considerations for protected persons’; section 10, ‘A44(1) reports concerning \npermanent residents of Canada’). \n  \n6.2 Procedures for persons less than 18 years old or persons unable to \nappreciate the nature of the proceedings \n \nR228(4) provides for specific safeguards for certain vulnerable persons by requiring that where \nthe person: \n \n \nis under 18 years of age and not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally \nresponsible for them;  or  \n \nis unable, in the opinion of the Minister, to appreciate the nature of the proceedings and \nis not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally responsible for them \n \nthe matter must be referred to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  In these cases, the MD does \nnot have jurisdiction to issue a removal order.   \n \nSuch cases will call for a higher degree of procedural fairness at the A44 stage and officers \nmust take extra care to ensure that the person’s interests are represented and that the evidence \nhas been fully and fairly considered. \n \nDuring the ID proceedings, a designated representative will be appointed pursuant to A167(2) to \nrepresent the person’s interests and ensure that procedural fairness requirements are met with\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n12 \n \n \nrespect to presenting evidence relevant to the case and providing a response to facts or new \ninformation that will be considered by the decision-maker. In these hearings, parties will also be \ngoverned by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Chairperson Guideline 8: \n‘Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB’ \n \nWhere a person appears to be unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, it is \nimportant for officers to identify this as soon as possible during the A44(1) process. Where an \nofficer, in the course of their interactions with a person, has identified that a person has a \nsuspected or known mental illness and does not appreciate the nature of the proceedings, this \nshould be clearly documented in notes and flagged for the MD.  \n \nIn such cases, officers should also ensure that other departmental and agency guidelines with \nrespect to dealing with vulnerable persons are followed.  See section 6.6 ‘Dealing with \nvulnerable persons’;  ENF 20 Detention; and ENF 34 Alternatives to Detention. \n \nFor additional guidance, including how to identify a vulnerable person, see IRCC Program \ndelivery instructions on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and \nvulnerable persons. \n \n6.3 Official languages \n \nBoth the Official Languages Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establish \nthe right of individuals who are subject to administrative proceedings in Canada to communicate \nwith employees of IRCC and CBSA in the official language of their choice, either in French or \nEnglish. Officers carrying out the administration of the IRPA must respect the right of the \nindividual to proceed in French or English. In order to ensure that procedural fairness is \nmaintained, officers should ensure that the Minister’s documents are provided in the language \nof the proceedings and, where necessary, obtain translations (e.g., a certificate of conviction \nfrom another country that is not in French or English that the Minister is relying on as evidence). \n \n6.4 Interpreters \n \nOfficers must be satisfied that the person concerned is able to understand and communicate in \neither of the official languages in which the proceeding is being held. If necessary, an interpreter \nis to be provided to enable the persons to understand and communicate fully.  \n \nNote:  Travellers arriving at a port of entry into Canada do not have an automatic right to an \ninterpreter upon request during routine port of entry examinations, however there are situations \nwhere officers at the port of entry are required to suspend the proceedings until a qualified \ninterpreter is available. This may include circumstances where the officer is considering denying \nentry to the traveller. For further information, see Nere v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n2018 FC 672.  \n \nCBSA officers should consult guidelines on the use of interpreters contained in ENF 4 Port of \nentry examinations (section 8.5, ‘Use of interpreters’).  \n \nFor further information, see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on interpreters.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n13 \n \n \n6.5 Counsel  \n \nPersons do not have a right to counsel at examinations or A44(1) interviews unless they are \ndetained. In all detained cases, persons must be given the opportunity to obtain and instruct \ncounsel at their own expense. Counsel includes a barrister, solicitor, family member, consultant \nor friend. \n \nIn detained cases, officers must inform persons of their right to counsel prior to commencing the \ninterview. This right applies in all cases (port of entry or inland) where a person is detained \nunder an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the criminal \ncourts while facing charges or serving a sentence and interviewed for IRPA purposes. \n \nPort of entry:  Generally, CBSA’s policy is not to permit counsel at a port of entry examinations \nunless arrest/detention has occurred. However, if an officer is dealing with an individual who \ndoes have counsel present, the officer should allow the counsel to remain present as long as \ncounsel does not interfere with the examination process.  \n \nNote:  In Dehghani v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] 1 S.C.R. \n1053], the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) determined that the principles of fundamental \njustice do not include the right to counsel for routine information-gathering, such as that \ngathered at port of entry examination interviews. The SCC further held that an Immigration \nSecondary examination at a port of entry does not constitute a detention within the meaning of \nparagraph 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.2  \n \nFor further information regarding the right to counsel at POE examinations, see ENF 4 Port of \nentry examinations. \n \nIn non-detained inland cases (CBSA/IRCC):  A non-detained person does not have the right \nto have counsel present during A44(1) interviews, however in the spirit of procedural fairness, \nthe officer shall inform the person of the possibility of obtaining counsel prior to commencing the \ninterview. Officers should permit counsel’s participation should the individual subject to the \nA44(1) process have a counsel. Call-in notices for interviews should advise the person that they \nmay have counsel present. \n \nWhere counsel is representing the person concerned at an examination or A44(1) proceeding, \nofficers should ensure that counsel’s identity, the fact of counsel’s presence at the proceeding \nand statements made by counsel on behalf of the person concerned are documented in the \nofficer’s notes, and that counsel’s representations have been considered in their decision. \nOfficers may also need the person’s representative to complete a Use of a Representative form \n(IMM 5476).   \n \nFor further information, see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on Use of \n                                                \n2 Although the SCC held that secondary examination does not constitute detention, this decision also \nhighlighted that detention within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter would result where restraints \non the person’s liberty by state authorities have gone beyond those required for the routine processing or \nscreening of their application to enter Canada. Further, while the SCC’s decision affirmed that delays in \nroutine examinations due to operational necessity do not mean the person is “detained”, officers should \nbe cognizant that unreasonably lengthy delays in the examination could lead to the conclusion that the \nperson is detained within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n14 \n \n \nRepresentatives. \n \nParticipation by counsel involves speaking on the client's behalf, presenting evidence and \nmaking submissions on the issues. Allowing counsel to participate, if ready to do so, does not \nmean that the officer is required to tolerate disruptive or discourteous behaviour by counsel. \nWhere such conduct is encountered, counsel may be asked to leave and/or the proceeding may \nbe adjourned to another time. In such cases, the officer should ensure to document their \nreasons for taking such action. \n \n6.6 Dealing with vulnerable persons  \n \n6.6.1 Considerations for vulnerable persons in the context of A44 \n \nIt is an overall goal of Canada’s immigration program to treat all persons with dignity and \nrespect. In exercising their IRPA authorities, officials must approach all cases in a \nnonjudgmental manner, remain sensitive to the potential needs and limitations of vulnerable \npersons, and recognize that a person they are dealing with may have experienced some form of \nviolence, abuse or trauma. \n \nIn the context of A44, vulnerable persons may face particular challenges, including an impaired \nability to answer questions/provide information to officials respecting a potential IRPA \ninadmissibility, due to a physical or psychological frailty or for other reasons. Such persons may \ninclude, but would not be limited to: \n \n \nminors (under 18 years of age), including unaccompanied minors;  \n \nelderly persons; \n \nindividuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities;  \n \npersons with a suspected or known mental illness; \n \npersons who have suffered traumatic experiences that resulted in some degree of \nvulnerability, including: \no victims3 of gender-based violence (GBV) (see section 6.6.3); \no victims/suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIPs) or family violence. \n \nIn the context of A44 procedures, officers should: \n \n \nIdentify vulnerable persons at the earliest opportunity in order to ensure that appropriate  \naccommodations are made and any relevant considerations are factored into decisions \nand actions taken. In some instances, officers will need to use their observational skills, \ndiscretion and sound judgement in identifying a person as vulnerable.   \n \n \nRecognize that a vulnerable individual’s ability to respond to questions or provide \ninformation may be severely impaired, and remain sensitive to the impact of a perceived \nvulnerability during the A44 process, including during interviews. \n \n \nTo the extent possible, prevent vulnerable persons from becoming traumatized or re-\ntraumatized during the A44 process. \n \n                                                \n3 It is important to recognize wherever the term “victim” is used, that some persons who have experienced \nviolence, trauma or abuse may prefer to be referred to as “survivors” rather than “victims”.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n15 \n \n \nWhere an individual who is subject to IRPA enforcement action is identified as a victim of \nviolence, trauma or abuse, including victims of GBV, family violence or trafficking in persons, or \nother forms of abuse such as sexual abuse or labour abuse, officers must take a victim-\ncentered and trauma-informed approach in order to avoid re-victimizing people who report \nviolence or abuse.  \n \nA victim-centred approach focuses on the needs and concerns of victims to ensure a \ncompassionate and sensitive delivery of services in a nonjudgmental manner.  \n \nA trauma-informed approach is one that avoids triggering trauma that may have placed the \nindividual in their current situation. \n \nThe guidelines in sections 6.6.2 to 6.6.5 are aimed at assisting officers in identifying vulnerable \npersons and applying a victim-centred and trauma-informed approach when dealing with \nvulnerable persons at A44. \n \nIn addition to the guidelines set out in this manual chapter, officers should always ensure that \nother Departmental and Agency guidelines with respect to dealing with vulnerable persons and \nminors are followed, including IRCC’s Program delivery instructions on Identifying sensitive \ncases and on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable \npersons, where applicable. \n \n6.6.2 Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression and sex characteristics4 \n \nSome IRPA enforcement cases may involve individuals with, or who are perceived to have, \nsexual orientations, gender identities and expressions (SOGIE)5 that may not conform  to \nsocially accepted norms in a particular cultural environment. Such individuals include, but are \nnot limited to: Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and additional \nsexually and gender diverse (2SLGBTQI+) individuals. Depending on factors such as race, \nethnicity, religion, faith or belief system, age, disability, health status, social class and education, \nindividuals with diverse sexual orientations and identities may recognize and express their \nidentity differently.  \n \nIndividuals may conceal their SOGIE out of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-\nstate actors, or due to previous experiences of discrimination, stigmatization, bullying, \nostracism, violence or sexual assault. These circumstances may manifest themselves as an \nindividual being reluctant to discuss, or having difficulty discussing, their SOGIE with an officer \nbased on a fear or general mistrust of authority figures, particularly where intolerance or \npunishment of individuals with diverse SOGIE are sanctioned by state officials in an individual’s \ncountry of origin. \n \nOfficers need to be sensitive to the possibility that SOGIE issues may exist in any case they \nencounter when executing their IRPA authorities. Officers must follow all relevant guidelines and \nprocedures pertaining to handling SOGIE cases during the A44 process, remain sensitive to \n                                                \n4 Please note that terminology in this section may have further evolved following the publication date of \nthis manual. Consult most recent GoC publications for most up to date terminology.   \n5 Also includes individuals with, or who are perceived to have diverse sex characteristics and may also be \nreferred to as SOGIESC. For example, see the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada’s \nChairperson’s Guidelines on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity \nand Expression, and Sex Characteristics: https://irb.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/policies/Pages/GuideDir09.aspx\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n16 \n \n \ngender-related considerations when interacting with the person and be careful to use gender-\nneutral or inclusive terms or terms that reflect the person’s gender identification in \ndocumentation/notes and when completing Departmental and Agency forms. \n \nOfficers should consult the Internationally recognized sexual orientation or gender identity or \nexpression (SOGIE) definitions on IRCC’s Connexion for further information. \n \n6.6.3 Victims of gender-based violence (GBV) \n \nWhen considering enforcement under A44, officers need to be sensitive to the fact that a person \nthey encounter may have been subjected to specific violence, trauma or abuse based solely on \ntheir gender, perceived gender, gender identity or gender expression, as well as sexual \norientation. This is referred to as gender-based violence (GBV), which is a human rights \nviolation.  \n \nIt is important to note that GBV is not limited to physical violence and can also include \nemotional/psychological abuse, harassment, threats, sexual violence, coercive control, \nhumiliation, financial abuse, discrimination or neglect. It is important to note that these may also \noccur online through “cyberviolence”6.  \n \nOfficers should be aware that certain individuals face a greater risk of experiencing GBV, \nincluding:  women, girls, 2SLGBTQI+ people and people living with disabilities. Moreover, the \nrisk of GBV may be increased with the intersection of any two or more of these characteristics. \nOther groups that may experience high levels of GBV may also include Black women and \nnewcomer women to Canada7.  \n \nIntimate partner violence (IPV), also referred to as domestic violence or spousal violence, is a \nwidespread form of GBV that encompasses multiple forms of harm perpetrated by a current or \nformer intimate partner or spouse. IPV can occur in many types of relationships, including \nbetween married or common-law spouses as well as within dating relationships, regardless of \ngender and sexual orientation and whether or not the partners co-habit. \n \nFor further information respecting IPV, see the Government of Canada’s Fact sheet on Intimate \npartner violence. \n \nDepending on their cultural background, victims of GBV may be reluctant to disclose their \nexperiences in order to not “shame” their families or communities. Similarly, women who have \nbeen subjected to IPV/domestic violence or abuse may also be reluctant to provide information, \nespecially against the alleged perpetrator. Officers should be alert to such cases and will ensure \nto the extent possible that specific accommodations are made during interviews as set out  \n(e.g., have a female officer either conduct or be present during an interview, and arrange, if \npossible, for a female interpreter). See section 6.6.4 below for additional guidance on \nconducting interviews. \n \nVictims and survivors of GBV may be encountered both at the port of entry or inland. In such \ncases, officers should: \n                                                \n6 “Use of technologies to facilitate virtual or in-person harm including observing and listening to a person, \ntracking their location, to scare, intimidate or humiliate a person” (Government of Canada, Fact sheet: \nIntimate partner violence (Canada.ca). \n7 Government of Canada, What is gender-based violence? (Canada.ca)\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n17 \n \n \n \n \nConsider the factors that led to the individual’s breach of IRPA requirements or conditions, \nincluding the possibility that the person was placed in their situation as part of abuse or \nthrough coercion or threats; \n \nBe aware that perpetrators of GBV are known to use threats of denunciation to immigration \nauthorities as a tool to control and oppress victims through fear of deportation and/or \ndetention. For example, Immigration Enforcement Officers (IEOs) responding to a tip about \na foreign national overstaying their status shall consider any such factors that may lead the \nofficer to believe that the foreign national was placed in that situation by an abuser; \n \nWithin the confines of an officer’s limited discretion at A44(1), be sensitive to personal \ncircumstances as well as the consequences of immigration enforcement;  \n \nWhere appropriate and within an officer’s scope of discretion, consider other options where \nthere are IRPA inadmissibility concerns. At the port of entry, this may include allowing the \nperson to withdraw their application to enter Canada (i.e. Allowed to leave) or issuing a \nTemporary resident permit (TRP) to overcome an inadmissibility that may have resulted \nfrom GBV. In the inland and port of entry context, this may include a referral to IRCC for \nTRP consideration and/or to community-based service organizations experienced in \nproviding services to GBV victims and survivors in accordance with existing policy and \nregional procedures or allowing the person to make arrangements to leave Canada if they \nplan to do so. \n \nFor further resources on GBV, please refer to the Government of Canada’s Gender-Based \nViolence Knowledge Centre (Canada.ca). \n \n6.6.4 Interviewing vulnerable persons  \n \nOfficers must be alert to situations where a person’s ability to answer questions and present \ninformation during A44 proceedings may be impacted by one or more factors listed in section \n6.6.1 above. Officers may find that vulnerable persons may have issues affecting their memory, \nbehaviour, or ability to recount relevant events including symptoms that have an impact on the \nconsistency and coherence of their statements.  \n \nOfficers should be cognizant that individuals react to violence, trauma and abuse in different \nways and not all victims will exhibit identical or even similar signs and/or symptoms. While some \nindividuals may show signs of distress, including anxiety, irritability, nervousness, agitation, \nanger and aggressiveness, others may be easily intimidated and have difficulty communicating. \n \nIn order to conduct A44 interviews in a way that avoids traumatizing vulnerable persons or re-\nvictimizing persons who have experienced violence, trauma or abuse, officers should: \n \nRecognize that some vulnerable persons may display less obvious symptoms of a \nvulnerability, which may not become apparent until the person is interviewed/examined. \nOfficers may need to rely on observational skills and sound judgement in identifying \nsigns and symptoms of a vulnerability.   \n \nBe aware that some vulnerable persons may require special accommodations during the \ninterview. Remain sensitive to the fact that victims of severe trauma may have difficulties \ncoping with the interview process because they are confined to a closed room with the \ninterviewer. \n \nCreate optimum conditions to minimize stress. Allow for frequent breaks, if necessary \nand to the extent possible.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n18 \n \n \n \nBe conscious of cultural and gender considerations which may affect communication \nsuch as the person and officer being the same gender, where possible. \n \nRecognize that victims of violence or abuse may fear people in authority and may be \nintimidated by the many questions that are being asked by officials. \n \nRecognize that victims of GBV or other forms of violence or abuse may become \ndistressed at the prospect of being interviewed by an officer of the opposite sex. \n \nWhere appropriate, speak to the person alone first in a confidential setting and ask if \nthey are comfortable speaking in front of family members (particularly parents, children \nor relatives of a particular gender). \n \nProvide the person with a fair opportunity to tell the story. \n \nBe cognizant that there may only be one opportunity for an individual to reach out to \nauthorities, and for authorities to refer a victim of violence or abuse to victim support \nservices.  \n \nBe courteous, respectful, sensitive and aware of own biases. \n \nBe aware that some questions may cause a victim to recall painful events. \n \nTreat the person with sensitivity and with empathy and with full respect of their human \nrights. \n \nAvoid an authoritarian approach. \n \nAvoid over-familiarity through eye contact or body language. \n \nAsk simple questions and use encouragement. \n \nUse active listening. \n \nAllow free speech and avoid interruption. \n \nRemember that if the vulnerable person is under 18 years of age or unable to appreciate \nthe nature of the proceedings, procedural safeguards set out in section 6.2 will apply. \n \n6.6.5 TRPs for victims or suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIP) or family \nviolence  \n \nOfficers should keep in mind that there are specific policy guidelines in place respecting \nsuspected or known victims of trafficking in persons (VTIP) and victims of family violence. While \nonly IRCC officials may issue TRPs to VTIPs or victims of family violence, CBSA officials should \nfollow the guidelines set out in the IRCC Program delivery instructions for handling these cases. \nFor example, cases in which a foreign national is identified by the CBSA as a VTIP or victim of \nfamily violence should be referred to the responsible IRCC local office on an urgent basis. There \nare also instructions pertaining to IRCC procedures for contacting CBSA with respect to \nindividuals who are subject to a removal order that are applying for a VTIP or victim of family \nviolence TRP.  \n \nWhen dealing with victims or suspected victims, officers must continue to apply existing policy \nguidance respecting VTIPs and victims of family violence. For example, officers will take a \nvictim-centred and trauma-informed approach when a permanent resident or foreign national is \nidentified as a possible VTIP and follow existing guidelines and procedures specific to \nidentifying and interviewing suspected VTIPs, as well as identifying and conducting interviews \nfor suspected human traffickers who are encountered at the port of entry or inland.  \n \nOfficers should always be alert to any information that raises concerns that a minor child has \nbeen trafficked, smuggled or abducted. In such situations, officers should refer to the \nprocedures set out in the following guidance: \n \nENF 21 Recovering missing, abducted and exploited children  \n \nTemporary resident permits (TRPs): Considerations specific to victims of trafficking in \npersons\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n19 \n \n \n7 Procedure: Making a decision to write an A44(1) report \n \n7.1 Preparation and transmission of an A44(1) report \n \nUnder A44(1), an officer may prepare a report if that officer is of the opinion that a permanent \nresident or foreign national in Canada is inadmissible. Officers cannot assign the discretionary \nauthority to another person, nor can another person fetter an officer’s discretion by obliging an \nofficer to do or not do something that is at the officer’s discretion. However, once a report is \nprepared under A44(1), it must be transmitted to the MD. \n \nAlthough an A44(1) report may result from an examination, an examination is not a necessary \nprerequisite for an officer to prepare and transmit a report to the MD. This is due to the fact that \nofficers are only authorized to proceed with an examination under prescribed circumstances.   \nFor further information regarding the examination process, please refer to section 11.4, \n‘Procedure: Overview of the examination process’ and ENF 4 Port of Entry Examinations. \n \nThe wording of A44(1) allows an officer to prepare a report in relation to a permanent resident or \na foreign national “who is in Canada”. In most cases, particularly in regards to foreign nationals, \nthe inadmissibility will be directly linked to the person’s physical presence in Canada (e.g., non-\ncompliance with A29(2) for remaining in Canada beyond the period authorized). In general, an \nofficer will only prepare an A44(1) report where the person is physically present in Canada, \nhowever this requirement must be considered in context. Where an officer receives credible \nevidence that a foreign national or permanent resident is no longer in Canada, the officer should \nnot proceed to write a report under A44(1). However, given that permanent residents have a \nright of entry and may be out of Canada for a number of reasons (e.g., vacation, work, etc.), it \nmay be reasonable for an officer to proceed to write an A44(1) report against a permanent \nresident without confirming that the permanent resident is physically present in Canada at the \ntime of the writing of A44(1) report, as long as procedural fairness requirements have been met. \nThis will also depend on the facts and circumstances of the case and may only be considered \nwhere there is no credible information to suggest that the person is no longer residing in \nCanada.  \n \n7.2 Procedure: Evidentiary requirements \n \nTo form the opinion that a person is inadmissible to Canada, an officer must have knowledge of \nthe evidentiary rules and requirements for immigration matters. Knowledge of what may be \nrequired to substantiate an allegation of inadmissibility is an important consideration in all cases. \nEach allegation has specific requirements for evidence and officers are to be guided by the \ncontent of ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility; and ENF 18 Human or \ninternational rights violations. \n \nBefore officers make a decision to write a report under A44(1), they must be satisfied that the \napplicable burden and standard of proof can be met and that sufficient evidence has been or \nmay be gathered to ensure that each element of an inadmissibility allegation can be satisfied. \n \n \n7.3 Burden of proof \n \nThe burden of proof, in the context of immigration legislation, refers to who is responsible for \nestablishing admissibility under the IRPA.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n20 \n \n \nUnder A45(d), the burden of establishing admissibility depends on whether or not the person \nhas been authorized to enter Canada.  \n \nIn cases of foreign nationals who are seeking entry (primarily applicable to Port of Entry cases) \nor those who entered Canada illegally, the onus is on the individual to establish that they are not \ninadmissible. Where the person has been authorized to enter Canada, the burden to establish \ninadmissibility is on the Minister. \n \nTable 3: Burden of proof  \n \nPersons authorized/not \nauthorized to enter \nDetails \nBurden of proof \nPermanent residents and \nforeign nationals authorized \nto enter \nA45(d) requires the Immigration Division to \nmake a removal order against a \npermanent resident or a foreign national \nwho has been authorized to enter Canada, \nif it is satisfied that they are inadmissible. \n \nConsequently, in cases involving persons \nwho were granted entry into Canada, \nincluding permanent residents, the onus \nrests on the Minister to establish that the \nperson is inadmissible. \n \n \n \nMinister  \nForeign nationals not \nauthorized to enter \nA45(d) requires the Immigration Division to \nmake a removal order if it is not satisfied \nthat a foreign national who has not been \nauthorized to enter Canada is not \ninadmissible. A21(1) states that a foreign \nnational becomes a permanent resident \nand A22(1) states that a foreign national \nbecomes a temporary resident if an officer \nis satisfied that, inter alia, the foreign \nnational is not inadmissible. \n \nThis applies to persons seeking entry into \nCanada or those persons who have \nentered illegally. Consequently, the onus is \non these persons to establish that they are \nnot inadmissible. \n \n \n \nForeign national \n \n7.4 Standard of Proof \n \nThe term “standard of proof” refers to the degree to which the decision-maker must be satisfied. \n \nImmigration proceedings are civil in nature and therefore the general standard of proof is the \none applicable to civil matters: balance of probabilities. However A33 provides that, unless \notherwise provided, the standard of proof for allegations listed under sections A34 to A37, is a \nlower standard of proof: reasonable grounds to believe that the facts have occurred, are\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n21 \n \n \noccurring or may occur, applies. \n \n“Balance of Probabilities” is a civil standard of proof used in administrative tribunals. It means \nthat the evidence presented must show that the facts as alleged are more probable than not. \nThe party having the burden of proof must demonstrate that the evidence presented outweighs \nany opposing evidence or arguments. It is a higher standard of proof than “reasonable grounds \nto believe”, but is lower than the criminal standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” used in \ncriminal proceedings. \n \n“Reasonable grounds to believe” is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility that a fact has \nbeen established based on credible evidence. Reasonable grounds to believe is more than \nsuspicion. Some objective basis for the belief has to exist. Put another way, the fact itself need \nnot be proven; it is enough to show reasonable grounds for believing the allegation true. \nInformation used to establish reasonable grounds should be specific, compelling, credible and \nbe received from a reliable source. \n \nThe following table summarizes the standard of proof for sections A34 to A42: \n \nTable 4:  Standard of proof  \n \nReasonable grounds to believe \nBalance of probabilities \n \n \nSecurity (A34) \n \n \nViolation of human or international rights \n(A35) \n \n \nSanctions (A35.1) \n \n \nCriminality (A36) – except for A36(1)(c) \nfor permanent residents \n \nTransborder criminality [A36(2.1)] \n \nOrganized criminality (A37) \n \n \n \n \nAct committed outside Canada – for \npermanent residents only [A36(1)(c)] \n \n \nHealth grounds (A38) \n \n \nFinancial grounds (A39) \n \n \nMisrepresentation (A40) \n \n \nCessation (A40.1) \n \n \nNon-compliance with the Act or the \nRegulations  (A41) \n \n \nInadmissible family member (A42) \n \n \n8 Considerations before writing an A44(1) Report- Scope of officer     \n       discretion      \n             \n8.1 Limited discretion of officer at A44(1) \n \nThe fact that an officer has the discretionary power to decide whether or not to write an A44(1) \nreport does not mean that the officer can disregard the fact that someone is, or may be, \ninadmissible. \n \nRather, discretion under A44 means that officers and MDs have some flexibility in managing \ncases where the person is inadmissible, however the objectives of the IRPA may or will be\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n22 \n \n \nachieved without the need to seek a removal order or write a formal inadmissibility report under \nA44(1), for example:  \n \n•  where an officer allows the voluntary withdrawal of an application to enter Canada \n(Allowed to leave) option at a port of entry (see section 9.4); \n•  where an officer decides to issue a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) to a foreign \nnational who is seeking entry to work in Canada and who was convicted of a non-violent \noffence many years ago, taking into account the relevant assessment risk factors (see \nsection 9.7); \n•  where a person is already the subject of a removal order and an officer has \ndetermined that the objectives of the IRPA would not be served by the issuance of an \nadditional removal order; \n•  where an IRCC officer restores status to a foreign national who has remained in \nCanada beyond the period authorized. \n \nWhile the body of case law respecting the scope of an officer’s discretion varies, the courts have \naffirmed that an officer’s discretion under A44, is very limited.  \n \nThe courts have also found that this scope of discretion varies depending on the inadmissibility \ngrounds alleged, whether the person concerned is a permanent resident or a foreign national, \nand whether the MD or the Immigration Division has the authority to issue a removal order. In \nother words, the scope of discretion has been viewed as “variable and flexible”.8 \n \nFor example, in Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. Cha, 2006 \nFCA 126, a case involving a foreign national inadmissible under paragraph 36(2)(a) of the IRPA, \nthe Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) outlined that the particular circumstances of a foreign \nnational, the nature of the offence, the conviction, and the sentence are beyond the reach of an \nofficer when considering whether or not to write an A44(1) report for criminality or serious \ncriminality against a foreign national.  \n \nMore recent jurisprudence9 confirms that officers making decisions under A44 have very limited \ndiscretion, particularly in matters concerning serious criminality and organized criminality, and \nthat there is no obligation to consider factors related to humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) \nor ‘personal circumstances’. These decisions also confirm that at this the 44 stage, officers and \nMDs are conducting a fact-finding mission into “readily and objectively ascertainable facts” and \nthat this administrative screening function applies to both foreign nationals and permanent \nresidents. \n \nIn all cases, officers must carefully consider the consequences of not writing an A44(1) report as \na means of creating a formal record of an inadmissibility, given that this decision may have an \nimpact on possible future dealings with the person. This will be particularly important in cases \ninvolving security (A34), violation of human or international rights(A35), sanctions (A35.1), \nserious criminality [A36(1)] and organized criminality (A37), regardless of the status of the \nindividual. In such cases, it is important to have a formal record of that inadmissibility. This is \nbest accomplished by preparing an A44(1) report. \n \n                                                \n8 Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FCA 319. \n9 Obazughanmwen v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FCA 151; Sidhu v. \nCanada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FC 1681; Matharu v. Canada (Public Safety \nand Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 902\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n23 \n \n \nNote:  In most cases where an officer has made a decision to manage a case of an \ninadmissible person without writing an A44(1) report (e.g., where an officer is exercising their \ndiscretion to issue a TRP to overcome inadmissibility or allow the withdrawal of an application to \nenter Canada), there will be a corresponding disposition in GCMS which contains the officer’s \nreasons and rationale. However, where an officer’s decision does not have a corresponding \nrecord in GCMS, officers should record their decision, rationale and any specific circumstances \nconsidered in their decision in GCMS notes. \n \n8.2 Priority Cases: Inadmissibility under A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1) and A37 of the \nIRPA \n  \nIt was affirmed by the FCA in Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n2016 FCA 319, that within the context of A44, officers and the MD must always be mindful of \nParliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make security of Canadians a top priority. \n \nIn Sharma, the FCA also concluded that the Court’s rationale in Cha in support of a limited \ndiscretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals and permanent \nresidents. \n \nAlthough the factors contained in these guidelines may be considered when writing an A44(1) \nreport, an officer must always consider the various objectives of the IRPA, in particular A3(1)(h) \nand (i). As suggested by Federal Court of Canada jurisprudence, in cases of inadmissibility \nunder A34, A35, A36(1) and A37, the scope of discretion enjoyed by officers making a decision \nregarding whether or not to write an A44(1) report will be very narrow and it generally is \nreasonably open to an officer or an MD to prioritize public safety and security. \n \n \n9 A44(1) reports concerning foreign nationals  \n \n9.1 Considerations before writing an A44(1) report \n \nKeeping in mind the scope of discretion related to considerations for writing an A44(1) report \noutlined in section 8 of these guidelines, the following non-exhaustive factors may be \nconsidered when exercising the limited discretion under A44(1) with respect to foreign nationals \n(including officer options at the port of entry such as allowing the person to withdraw their \napplication to enter Canada under R42): \n \n \nHas the person been granted protected person status in Canada? What is the nature or \ncategory of the inadmissibility? \n \nIs the person already the subject of a removal order? \n \nIs the person already the subject of a separate inadmissibility report incorporating \nallegations that will likely result in a removal order? \n \nIs the officer satisfied that the person is, or soon will be, leaving Canada on their own \nvolition? And in such a case, is the imposition of a future requirement to obtain an \nauthorization to return warranted? \n \nIs there a record of the person having previously contravened immigration legislation? \n \nIn the case of non-compliance, was it unintentional or excusable for a valid reason? \n \nHas the person now been fully counselled on the topic of their inadmissibility? And is the \nofficer satisfied that the person now understands what is required in future to overcome \ntheir inadmissibility?\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n24 \n \n \n \nIs there any reason to believe that, after having previously been counselled on the topic \nof their inadmissibility, the person simply chose to ignore that counselling? \n \nHas the person been cooperative? \n \nIs there any evidence of misrepresentation? \n \nHas the person applied for restoration of status, and does the person appear to be \neligible? \n \nHas a temporary resident permit been authorized? \n \nHow long has the person been in Canada?   \n \nIn minor criminality cases, is a decision on rehabilitation imminent and likely to be \nfavourable? \n \n9.2 Special considerations for protected persons \n \nUnder the IRPA, protected persons are provided with certain protections, including the right of \nnon-refoulement under A115(1) and, subject to A64, the right under A63(3) to appeal to the \nImmigration Appeal Division (IAD) against a decision to make a removal order against them. \nThis was recognized by Justice Décary in Cha, who noted that the Act and the Regulations treat \npermanent residents differently than Convention Refugees who are, in turn, treated differently \nthan other foreign nationals.    \n  \nIt should be noted, however that the Federal Court jurisprudence would support that protected \npersons are not entitled to a higher degree of procedural fairness or participatory rights with \nrespect to the operation of A44(1) than other foreign nationals or permanent residents [see \nAwed v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 469]. Officers should also keep in mind \nthat the Federal Court has made findings to support the principle that officials carrying out \nA44(1) and (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate about how and when future \ndeportation might take place [Faci v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n2011 FC 693]. \n \nIn cases of protected persons, officers may also consider as an additional factor in their \nrecommendation to the MD, whether the facts of the case would support a referral for a \nMinisterial opinion (‘Danger Opinion’) under A115(2). For further information, see section 14.5, \n‘Overview:  Minister's opinions/interventions’. \n \n9.3 Dual intent  \n \nA22(2) states that the intention of a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not \npreclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that the person will \nleave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.  \n \nDual intent is present when a foreign national who has applied for permanent residence in \nCanada (or is entitled to apply for permanent residence within Canada) also seeks to enter \nCanada for a temporary period as a visitor, worker or student. If an officer has concerns/doubts \nabout the foreign national's bona fides, the foreign national must be made aware of these \nconcerns and given an opportunity to respond to them.  \n \nSome examples of dual intent could include: \n \n \na foreign national frequently visiting a Canadian spouse who has complied with \nprevious conditions of entry and is otherwise not inadmissible, even if an application\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n25 \n \n \nfor permanent residence has not yet been submitted; \n \na foreign national who has applied or intends to apply for permanent residence, but \nis visiting Canada to assess employment opportunities, setting up household, etc. \n \nThe Federal Court in Rebmann v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2005 FC 301 held that an officer \nis required to take into account the foreign national's dual intent in entering/remaining in Canada \nas a temporary resident and provide analysis of the relevant evidence with regards to the \nforeign national’s intention to establish permanent residence in Canada to show that the foreign \nnational will not leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay as a temporary \nresident. \n \nAn officer should distinguish between a foreign national whose intentions are bona fide and a \nforeign national who has no intention of leaving Canada at the end of their authorized stay if the \napplication for permanent residence is refused.  \n \nHowever, the possibility that a foreign national may, at some point in the future, be approved for \npermanent residence does not absolve the individual from meeting the requirements of a \ntemporary resident, specifically, to leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for their \nstay, in accordance with R179. \n \nIn assessing the foreign national’s intentions, officers should weigh all the factors relevant to the \ncase, including the length of time the foreign national has spent in Canada, the means of \nsupport; obligations and ties in the home country, previous compliance with requirements of the \nIRPA and any compassionate circumstances of the person concerned. These factors should be \nconsidered before proceeding with administrative enforcement action [i.e., writing an A44(1) \nreport].   \n \nOfficers are reminded to use their own judgment and the flexibility afforded to them by \nsubsection A22(2) when making decisions on cases where the foreign national also has the \nintention to become a permanent resident.  \n \nIn all cases, officers must ensure that GCMS notes clearly demonstrate the officer’s reasoning \nin their decision. \n \nFor further guidance on assessing dual intent considerations, see IRCC Program delivery \ninstructions on Dual intent. See also: ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \n9.4 Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed to leave (Port of \nentry cases)   \n \nIf a Border Services Officer examines a foreign national seeking entry and the person is alleged \nto be inadmissible, the officer may allow the person to voluntarily withdraw their application to \nenter the country and leave Canada. \n \nUnder R42, the officer who examines a foreign national who is seeking to enter Canada and \nwho has indicated that they want to withdraw their application to enter Canada shall allow the \nforeign national to withdraw their application, unless R42(2) applies. \n \nR42(2) provides that a foreign national shall not be allowed to withdraw their application to enter \nCanada where a report under A44(1) is being prepared or has been prepared, unless the\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n26 \n \n \nMinister does not make a removal order or refer the report to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  \nIn other words, once an officer writes an A44(1) report, the allowed to leave option may \nonly be exercised at the MD level. \n \nBefore writing an inadmissibility report under A44(1), officers should determine whether the \nobjectives of the IRPA are better served by allowing the person to voluntarily withdraw their \napplication to enter Canada pursuant to R42. In such circumstances, the same factors as \noutlined above in section 9.1, ‘Considerations before writing an A44(1) report’, are applicable. \n \nIf a person is allowed to leave Canada voluntarily, officers should counsel the person as follows: \n \n \ninform the person why they are believed to be inadmissible; \n \ninform the person that if they leave Canada voluntarily, they will be free to seek entry to \nCanada once the factor causing inadmissibility has been overcome; and \n \ninform the person of the possible consequences of an A44(1) report, including the \npossibility of an admissibility hearing and/or a removal order being made against them. \n \nIf a person is allowed to leave Canada voluntarily, the officer or MD must give the person  an \nAllowed to Leave Canada form (IMM 1282B).  \n \nFor further information on this procedure, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations.  \n \n9.5 Procedure:  Directing persons back to the United States under R41 \n \nR41 authorizes an officer to direct a foreign national seeking to enter Canada from the United \nStates (U.S.). to return to the U.S. if: \n \nno officer is able to complete an examination (R41(a)); \n \nthe Minister is not available to consider, under A44(2), a report made with \nrespect to the person (R41(b));  \n \nan admissibility hearing cannot be held by the ID (R41(c); or \n \nthe foreign national is prohibited from entering Canada by an order or regulation \nunder the Emergencies Act or the Quarantine Act \n \nIn such cases, the person concerned may be given a Direction to Return to the United States \nform (BSF505) in appropriate circumstances.   \n \nOfficers should be aware that refugee claimants may only be directed back to the U.S. under \nexceptional circumstances. For further guidance on how and when to use the direct back \npolicy for refugee claimants at land POE under exceptional circumstances, officers must consult \nENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \nA person who has been directed to return to the U.S. pending an admissibility hearing by the ID \nand who seeks to come into Canada for reasons other than to appear at that hearing is \nconsidered to be seeking entry. If such a person remains inadmissible for the same reason(s), \nand if a member of the ID is not reasonably available, the person may be directed again to \nreturn to the U.S. to wait until a member of the ID is available. In these circumstances it is not \nnecessary to write a new A44(1) report. \n \nNote: Persons directed back to the U.S. who choose not to return to Canada will not be subject \nto enforcement action, as they have no desire to continue with their application to enter Canada.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n27 \n \n \nSuch persons will simply be deemed to have withdrawn their application. Officers should \ntherefore not counsel the person that failure to return in these instances will result in \nenforcement action while the person is not in Canada. \n \nIn exceptional cases, it may be appropriate to pursue enforcement action for persons seeking \nentry who have failed to comply with R44(3) following a Direction under R41. Officers should \nconsider all information and individual circumstances of each case before they elect to proceed \nwith writing an A44(1) report for non-compliance, including the circumstances surrounding the \nfailure to comply and the intent of the person concerned. \n \nFor further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \n9.6 Restoration of status \n \nR182 describes a mechanism by which a visitor, worker or student who has lost temporary \nresident status for having failed to comply with any of the conditions imposed under R185(a), \nR185(b)(i) to (iii) or R185(c), may nevertheless submit an application to IRCC within the 90-day \nperiod of the loss of their status and, if eligible, have that status restored.  \n \nIt is important to note that under the D & D instruments, only IRCC officials have the authority to \nconsider an application for restoration of status. \n \nThe application submitted to IRCC shall be approved if the processing officer is satisfied that the \nforeign national continues to meet the initial requirements of their stay, and has not failed to \ncomply with any other conditions imposed and is not the subject of a declaration made under \nA22.1. It is to be noted that an officer shall not restore the status of a student if the student is not \nin compliance with a condition set out in R220.1(1). \n \nNote:  If a temporary resident has applied for an extension of their authorized status before the \nstatus expires, they are considered to have maintained status (formerly referred to as “implied \nstatus”) until a decision is made on their application. Maintained status works by operation of \nlaw [R183(5)], and the temporary resident cannot be reported for non-compliance until a \ndecision is made on their application for an extension, unless other IRPA inadmissibilities are \npresent. For further details regarding procedures for persons with maintained status, see IRCC \nProgram delivery instructions on Temporary residents: Maintained status during processing \n(previously called implied status). \n \nThe following guidelines must be taken into account by Inland Enforcement Officers (IEOs) prior \nto taking enforcement action in such cases:  \n \nScenario 1:  Foreign national is out of status, but has applied for restoration of status \nwithin the 90-day period and is otherwise admissible– decision pending \n \nForeign nationals who have submitted an application to have their status restored within the 90-\nday period, and who are not inadmissible under any other section of the IRPA or the IRPR, \nshould not be subject to an A44(1) report. In such circumstances, officers must allow for a \ndecision to be rendered by IRCC before taking enforcement action, an approach which is \nconsistent with the Federal Court’s findings in Sui v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and \nEmergency Preparedness), 2006 FC 1314.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n28 \n \n \n \nScenario 2: Foreign national is out of status and has not applied for restoration of status \nbut still within 90-day eligibility period \n \nWhile there is nothing in the IRPA or the Regulations that prohibits an officer from writing an \ninadmissibility report during the 90-day restoration period where no application for restoration \nhas yet been made, officers should consider whether or not to pursue enforcement action in \nsuch cases. After taking appropriate steps to ensure that a restoration application has not been \nmade, should an officer decide to write an A44(1) report and refer the report to the MD for \nreview, the officer should articulate their reasoning for  pursuing enforcement action in the \ndecision, if such action is pursued prior to the expiration of the 90-day eligibility period.  \nIn order to adhere to the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice, the officer must \nconsider each case on its own merits and may consider the following: \n \n \nDoes the foreign national state that they wish to remain in Canada and for what \npurpose? \n \nHas the foreign national already made arrangements to depart Canada in the immediate \nfuture? \n \nIs the foreign national evasive about their departure plans or the intent to remain in \nCanada? \n \nHas the foreign national otherwise been in compliance with the terms and conditions of \ntheir temporary resident status? \n \nIf the foreign national does not apply for a restoration of status, is the officer satisfied \nthat the foreign national will appear for future immigration interviews and/or depart \nCanada voluntarily? \n \nIf the officer is satisfied that the foreign national will seek to remedy lapsed status within \nthe 90-day period, then the officer may wish to allow the 90-day application period to \nlapse before reviewing the case again in consideration of enforcement action.  \n \nScenario 3: Foreign national is out of status beyond the 90-day restoration of status \neligibility period, or is otherwise inadmissible under the IRPA or Regulations \n \nIf an officer encounters a foreign national who has overstayed their authorized period of stay \nbeyond the 90-day eligibility period for applying for restoration of status, or where the foreign \nnational is otherwise inadmissible under the IRPA or Regulations, the officer may pursue \nappropriate enforcement action, which includes writing an A44(1) report and referring it to the \nMD for a review under A44(2). \n \n9.7 Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) - Port of entry and IRCC only \n \nIn some cases, a designated officer may exercise their authority under A24(1) to issue a TRP to \nallow a foreign national who is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements of the IRPA to \nenter or remain in Canada where it is justified in the circumstances. TRPs are always issued at \nthe discretion of the delegated authority and may be cancelled at any time. \n \nThe authority to issue a TRP is determined by the IRCC Designation and Delegation (D & D) \nInstrument and depends on the nature of the allegation.  \n \nNote:  For CBSA, TRPs may only be issued by designated officials at the port of entry.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n29 \n \n \nThere are instances where the person who has the delegated authority to review the A44 report \n(the MD) does not have the designated authority to issue a TRP. In such cases, the official with \nauthority to review the report (i.e., the MD) may make a recommendation to the person with the \ndesignated authority to issue a TRP.  \n \nTRPs should only be issued in accordance with the IRPA and the IRPR, and must follow the \nIRCC Program delivery instructions on Temporary resident permits. In all cases, officers and \nMDs must leave a record, which includes detailed notes entries in GCMS, of their decision or \nrecommendation.  For further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations, section 15.5, \n‘GCMS remarks’.  \n \nTRPs should only be issued after careful consideration of all assessment factors as the \ndocument carries privileges greater than those accorded to other visitors, students and workers \nwith temporary resident status.  Before issuing a TRP, an officer must consult the departmental \nand agency guidelines on risk assessment factors and procedures for issuing TRPs. This \napplies to both initial and subsequent TRPs.  \n \nWhere an officer does not have the authority to issue a TRP but has reviewed the case and is \nrecommending the issuance of a TRP, the officer must prepare a written a case summary that \nincludes a recommendation for a final decision.  The officer will refer the case file to the \ndecision-maker with the designated authority to issue a TRP for a final determination. If the \ndecision is made to issue a TRP, the decision-maker will determine the period of validity of the \nTRP.  \n \nFor further instructions and procedures for TRPs, officers must refer to the IRCC Program \ndelivery instructions on Temporary resident permits and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \nAdditional considerations for TRP issuance: \n \n \nA person is not eligible for a TRP if less than 12 months have passed since their \nclaim for refugee protection was last rejected [or determined to be withdrawn or \nabandoned as described under A24(4)]. \nException: The one-year ban on accessing a TRP under A24(4) does not bar an \nIRCC officer, on their own initiative, from considering a TRP for a victim of human \ntrafficking. \n \nThere are specific IRCC policy guidelines respecting certain vulnerable persons \nincluding suspected or known victims of human trafficking or victims of family \nviolence.  Only IRCC officials may issue TRPs to victims of human trafficking or victims \nof family violence, however CBSA officials should follow the procedures set out in the \nProgram delivery instructions above for handling these cases. \n \nIf a student, worker or visitor with valid temporary resident status is reported \nunder A44(1) but a decision is made not to hold an admissibility hearing or issue a \nremoval order, that person remains a temporary resident, and a TRP is not required \n \n9.8 A44(1) reports for inadmissible family members \n \nOfficers should be aware that they may need to assemble information about the family members \nof a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report and decide whether family members should\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n30 \n \n \nalso be reported and/or made subject to a removal order. Under A42, accompanying and non-\naccompanying family members may be inadmissible to Canada under prescribed \ncircumstances. This provision may only apply to family members who are foreign nationals, \nother than protected persons. \n \nOfficers should always consider reporting family members in order to avoid separating families \nor having other family members abandoned when one member must be removed from Canada. \n \nR1(3) provides that: \n \n1.(3) For the purposes of the Act, other than section 12 and paragraph 38(2)(d), and for the \npurposes of these Regulations, other than paragraph 7.1 (3)(a) and sections 159.1 and 159.5, \n\"family member\" in respect of a person means: \n \n(a) \nthe spouse or common-law partner of the person; \n(b) \na dependent child of the person or of the person’s spouse or common-law \npartner; and \n(c) \na dependent child of a dependent child referred to in paragraph (b). \n \nOfficers should note that under A42, a foreign national who is a temporary resident, applying to \nenter or remain as a temporary resident and has a family member who is inadmissible under \nA34, A35, A35.1 or A37, is inadmissible to Canada whether they are accompanying them or not. \nIt is also important to note that pursuant to the exceptions set out under A42(2), foreign \nnationals seeking temporary resident status who have an accompanying or non-accompanying \nfamily member who is inadmissible under any of the other provisions (A36, A38, A39, A40 or \nA41) of the IRPA cannot be reported under A42.   \n \nWhere an officer writes an A44(1) report against a family member for inadmissibility under A42, \nthe MD has jurisdiction under R228 to issue the applicable removal order. Officers should note, \nhowever, that for the purposes of A52(1), the making of a removal order against a foreign \nnational on the basis of inadmissibility under A42 is a prescribed circumstance that does not \noblige the foreign national to obtain the authorization of an officer in order to return to Canada. \n \nR227 sets out the prescribed circumstances under which an A44(1) report against a foreign \nnational is also considered a report against the foreign national’s family members in Canada.  \n \nR227(2) provides that, in the case of a report and a removal order made by the ID against a \nforeign national who has family members in Canada, the removal order issued by the ID against \na foreign is also a removal order against the family members in Canada without the need for a \nseparate inadmissibility report provided that an officer informed the family member(s): \n \n \nof the report; \n \nthat they are the subject of an admissibility hearing and, consequently, have the right to \nmake submissions and be represented, at their own expense, at the admissibility \nhearing; and \n \nthat they are subject to a decision of the ID that they are inadmissible under A42 on \ngrounds of being an inadmissible family member. \n \nWhile this procedural avenue may be available under the IRPR, it is generally recommended \nthat where an officer decides to pursue enforcement action against inadmissible family \nmembers of a foreign national under A42, the officer should proceed by way of writing a\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n31 \n \n \nseparate A44(1) report for each family member after the removal order has been made against \nthe foreign national.   \n \nOfficers should always be alert to the possibility that the family member of a foreign national \nmay be inadmissible in their own right and be mindful of situations where the evidence against a \nforeign national also independently supports an A44(1) report against their family member that \nis unrelated to the A42 inadmissibility. \n \n9.9 Impact of Ministerial public policies \n \nBefore writing an A44(1) report, officers should be aware of any public policies approved by the \nresponsible Minister that are currently in force, as well as any operational guidance related to \nimpacts of the public policy on procedures or considerations for decisions made under the \nIRPA. In general, these public policies grant temporary remedies or exemptions for certain IRPA \nrequirements for certain categories of persons who meet specified criteria set out in the policy. \nThey are generally in place for a specific and temporary period of time, however, some public \npolicies may remain in place for an extended period. Officers should ensure that they follow any \nnew guidance or instructions related to new public policies. \n \nOfficers should be aware that, unless a public policy specifies that a person is excluded from \ncertain requirements under the IRPA or the IRPR, all other legislative obligations and \ninadmissibility provisions continue to apply. \n \n \n10 A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents of Canada \n \nWhile permanent residents are given an opportunity to make submissions as part of procedural \nfairness during the A44 process, they cannot be compelled to attend an interview, answer \nquestions or provide submissions. As noted in section 11.7, permanent residents are only \nsubject to an obligation to answer questions when subject to examination at a port of entry, and \nonly insofar as it relates to establishing that they hold permanent resident status. \n \nThe submissions and evidence provided on behalf of a permanent resident should be reviewed \non a case-by-case basis and an officer must clearly articulate which factors were considered.  \n \nOfficers must ensure that all relevant factors have been addressed in their written \nrecommendation to the MD and may best achieve this by preparing a narrative report under \nA44(1), which is to accompany the A44(1) report when it is transmitted to the MD. Officers must \nalso ensure that they forward to the MD all submissions and documents filed by the person \nconcerned as well as any other evidence relied on in the officer’s recommendation.  \n \nIn Hernandez v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2007 FC \n725, the Federal Court held that while a narrative report is not required when referring the \nA44(1) report to the MD, where the officer has prepared such a report, all accompanying notes \nor appendices must be provided to the MD in full. The court also held that once such material is \ncreated and delivered to the Minister, it must be provided to the person concerned prior to the \nadmissibility hearing – this is particularly so when a specific request has been made. \n \nSee Appendix E:  Sample A44(1) Narrative report.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n32 \n \n \nOfficers should also provide reasons for giving more weight to certain documents over others \nwhere there is conflicting or inconsistent information before them. For example, where there are \nconflicting versions of events pertaining to a criminal offence, an explanation as to why one \nversion is being relied on over the other should be provided in the officer’s recommendation.  \n \n10.1 A44(1) reports for criminality cases  \n \nIn Medovarski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration); Esteban v. Canada (Minister \nof Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 51, the SCC stated that the objectives in the IRPA \nreflect an intent to prioritize security and that this objective is given effect by removing persons \nwith criminal records from Canada. The SCC noted that in drafting the IRPA, Parliament \ndemonstrated a strong desire to treat criminals less leniently than under the former Immigration \nAct. This was noted in Sharma, where the FCA affirmed that officers and MDs, when dealing \nwith matters under A44(1) and A44(2), must always be mindful of the various objectives of the \nIRPA, in particular A3(1)(h) and (i). The FCA also concluded that the Court’s rationale in Cha in \nsupport of a limited discretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals \nand permanent residents.  \n \nIt is strongly urged that, whenever possible, officers who prepare the A44(1) report in serious \ncriminality cases obtain detailed documentation to support the assessment. Hearings Officers \nwill also find this documentation essential when presenting the case before the ID or when \ndefending a removal order that is challenged at the IAD. \n \nThree principal factors indicate the seriousness of an offence:  \n \n \nthe circumstances of the particular incident under consideration;  \n \nthe sentence imposed; and  \n \nthe maximum sentence that could have been imposed.  \n \nThe fact that a conviction falls within A36(1) is itself an indication of its seriousness for \nimmigration purposes. It is also important for officers to be aware that sentences imposed by the \ncourts may have been subject to plea bargaining. The Crown may agree to a reduced sentence \nif the person pleads guilty. The circumstances of the crime are not viewed less seriously, but \nsaving the court the time and expense of a full trial is taken into consideration in determining the \nsentence.  \n \nThe best documentation is a transcript of the trial judge's remarks on conviction or sentencing, \ncommonly known as the Judge's Reasons for Sentence. Additionally, reports from probation \nofficials, police agencies, correctional facilities, etc. provide valuable information regarding the \ncircumstances of the offence and sometimes the potential for rehabilitation.  \n \nThe following may be considered when assessing the seriousness of an offence: \n \nI. \nCircumstances of the offence: \n \n• \nDid the crime involve violence?  \n• \nDid the crime include the use of a firearm?  \n• \nWas it a crime against a person (specifically, was it a crime against a child or children, \nmentally or physically challenged persons, or senior citizens), a racially motivated crime, a \ncrime of gender-based violence, a hate crime or a crime involving trafficking in large\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n33 \n \n \nquantities of drugs or in hard drugs (for example, heroin)?  \n• \nHow serious were the consequences for the victim? \n  \nII. \nCriminal history:  \n \n• \nIs the permanent resident a first time offender? \n• \nIs there a pattern of committing offences (recidivist), and, if so, are the offences committed \nbecoming more serious?  \n• \nWas the permanent resident influenced by others in the commission of the crime? \n \nIII. \nLength of sentence:  \n \n• \nWhat type of sentence was imposed on the permanent resident?  \n• \nWas jail imposed?  \n• \nHas probation or parole been denied?  \n \n10.2 Loss of appeal right cases \n \nDuring the assessment under A44(1) for permanent residents and protected persons, officers \nshould gather all information pertaining to whether or not the person will have a right of appeal \nto the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD). \n \nFor inadmissibility under A36(1)(a) for permanent residents, it is important for officers to obtain \nthe most accurate evidence of the sentence imposed to determine whether the person retains a \nright of appeal. Under A64, a loss of appeal rights for serious criminality under A36(1)(a) must \nbe with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least six \nmonths.  Where it is not clear from the evidence whether the sentence meets the six month \nthreshold under A64(2), before making any assessment under A44(1), the officer should \ndetermine how the judge calculated the total sentence imposed as reflected in the court \ndocuments, taking into account the imposition of further credits for time served. Regardless of \nwhat assessment is made by the officer, and especially in cases where the right of appeal is in \ndoubt, officers should clearly articulate that the determination as to whether the person \nconcerned retains a right of appeal ultimately rests with the IAD. \n \n10.3 Whether to consider personal circumstances for permanent residents and protected \npersons in recommendation to MD to accompany A44(1) report \n \nDuring the course of A44(1) proceedings, an officer may receive evidence or submissions \nrelating to a permanent resident or protected person’s personal circumstances and why a \nremoval order should not be sought. \nAs confirmed by the courts10, officers are not obligated to consider personal circumstances \nduring the A44(1) process. However, the courts have also affirmed that officers retain the \ndiscretion to consider these circumstances, and if they exercise their discretion to do so, it has \nto be reasonable. The discretion is tempered by their limited role at A44(1).11 The guidance in \nthis section is intended to assist officers determine when and how to exercise such discretion. \n                                                \n10 Obazughanmwen v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FCA 151; Sidhu v. \nCanada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FC 1681; Matharu v. Canada (Public Safety \nand Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 902 \n11 Dass v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 624\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n34 \n \n \n \nOfficers must always keep in mind the principles set out in sections 8.2 and 10.1 above when \nrendering decisions under A44(1), including Parliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make \nsecurity of Canadians a top priority.  \n \nIn consideration of the various objectives of the IRPA and the limited discretion of officers at \nA44 as confirmed by the courts, the CBSA’s policy is that officers must consider the factors \nbelow when deciding whether or not to exercise their limited discretion to consider evidence or \nsubmissions filed by the person concerned regarding personal circumstances.  \nGenerally speaking, the following factors would weigh against consideration of personal \ncircumstances in an officer’s recommendation to the MD: \n \nthe inadmissibility falls under section A34, A35, A35.1 or A37;   \n \n \nA36(1) serious criminality cases in the following circumstances: \no the permanent resident or protected person was previously issued a \nwarning letter by CBSA or had a previous removal order stayed or \nquashed by the IAD on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; \no the reportable offence: involved violence that resulted in bodily or \npsychological harm to another person, the use of a firearm or is a sexual \noffence; was committed against a vulnerable person (e.g. minor child or \nintellectually or physically challenged persons, or senior citizen), was a \nracially motivated crime, a crime of gender-based violence, including \ndomestic violence, a hate crime or a crime involving trafficking or \nsmuggling in large quantities of a controlled substance or weapons;  \no the criminal record of the permanent resident or protected person \ndemonstrates a pattern of escalating seriousness \n \nIf the decision is not to consider personal circumstances, the officer at 44(1) should state this in \ntheir recommendation to the MD. For example, the officer may state in their decision: “I am not \nexercising my discretion to consider evidence and/or submissions filed on behalf of (name of \nperson concerned) pertaining to their personal circumstances given the seriousness of the \nreportable offence”.  \n \nIf an officer exercises discretion to consider personal circumstances \n \nWhile the courts have affirmed that an officer is not required to consider personal \ncircumstances, if an officer does exercise their discretion to consider such factors, they must \nensure that the factors considered are weighed in a fair manner and render a decision that is \n“justified, intelligible and transparent”.12 Any assessment of a person’s personal circumstances \nmust be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. In addition, the courts have held that in \ncases involving allegations of criminality or serious criminality, where such factors are rejected, \nan explanation should be provided, even if only very brief in nature.13    \n                                                \n12 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 SCR 653 [Vavilov]  \nwherein the SCC affirmed at para. 85 that a reasonable decision is “one that is based on an internally \ncoherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain \nthe decision maker”. \n13 McAlpin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 422\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n35 \n \n \nIf an officer decides to consider the personal circumstances of the permanent resident (or \nprotected person), the CBSA’s policy is that they must balance these with the objectives of the \nIRPA to protect public health and safety, and maintain the security of Canadian society by \ndenying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals or security risks.  \n \nIf an officer does exercise their discretion to consider personal circumstances in their \nrecommendation to the MD, considerations may include, but are not limited to the following: \n \n \nAge at time of landing—has the person been a permanent resident of Canada \nsince childhood?  \n \nWas the permanent resident an adult at the time of admission to Canada? \n \nWas the person granted protected person status in Canada? \n \nLength of residence—how long has the person resided in Canada after the date \nof admission?  \n \nLocation of family support and responsibilities—are family members in Canada \nemotionally or financially dependent on the permanent resident? Are all extended \nfamily members in Canada?  \n \nDegree of establishment—is the permanent resident financially self-supporting? \nAre they employed? Do they have a marketable trade or skill? Has the \npermanent resident made efforts to establish themselves in Canada through \nlanguage training or skills upgrading? Is there any evidence of community \ninvolvement? Has the permanent resident received social assistance \n(frequency/duration)? \n \nCriminality—has the permanent resident been convicted of any prior criminal \noffence? Based on reliable information, is the permanent resident involved in \ncriminal or organized crime activities? What is the nature and frequency of the \nperson’s interactions with the law? (for further details please refer to section 10.1 \n‘A44(1) reports for criminality cases’).  \n \nWhat is the potential for rehabilitation? How much time has passed since the last \nconviction? Has the permanent resident already been released? For how long? \nHas the permanent resident accepted culpability, expressed remorse, enrolled in \nor completed educational, skills upgrading or rehabilitation programs (for \nexample, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narconon/narcotics rehabilitation programs, \nanger management programs, life skills)? Are family members willing and able to \nsupport/assist?  \n \nHistory of non-compliance and current attitude—has the permanent resident \nbeen cooperative and forthcoming with information? Has a warning letter been \npreviously issued? Does the permanent resident accept responsibility for their \nactions? Are they remorseful? \n \nBest interests of any children directly affected by the decision.  \n \nRight of appeal—does the person have a right of appeal to the Immigration \nAppeal Division if a removal order is issued? \n \nNone of these factors will necessarily outweigh other factors of the case. Moreover, in Faci v. \nCanada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2011 FC 693 the Federal Court made \nfindings to support the principle that officials carrying out A44(1) and (2) assessments are not \nobliged to speculate about how and when future deportation might take place. \n \nOverall, any consideration of personal circumstances, which is not required but if done, must \nbe reasonable, and must be weighed against the objectives of the IRPA to protect public health\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n36 \n \n \nand safety, and maintain the security of Canadian society, denying access to Canadian territory \nto persons who are criminals or security risks. \n \nNote: By inviting a permanent resident to provide information or make submissions regarding \ntheir personal circumstances at A44(1), this creates an expectation that the officer will engage \nwith this information in the A44(1) assessment and address it in the decision.  \n \nWhere the officer at A44(1) has exercised their discretion to consider personal circumstances in \ntheir recommendation, the MD must consider this information and explain in their decision \nwhether or not they concur with the officer’s recommendation.  \n \n10.4 Residency obligation cases under A28(2) - Prescribed considerations \n \nIf, following an examination of a permanent resident, an officer concludes that a permanent \nresident has failed to comply with the residency obligation under A28, the officer may prepare a \nreport for inadmissibility under A41(b) against a permanent resident, taking into account \nprescribed considerations set in the IRPA. A28(2)(c) specifically requires officers and the MD to \ntake into account humanitarian and compassionate considerations, including the best interests \nof a child directly affected by the determination, when assessing whether such considerations \novercome any breach of the residency obligation prior to the determination.   \n \nOfficers must articulate consideration of these prescribed factors in the decision to write a report \nunder A44(1) and/or their recommendation to the MD.  \n \nNote:  Officers should be aware that there are procedures in place for permanent residents who \nwish to renounce their permanent resident status pursuant to A46(1)(e). In certain cases, it may \nbe appropriate for a designated officer (IRCC or port of entry CBSA) to process a renunciation \napplication under R72.6 in place of an A44(1) report. For further guidance, officers should \nconsult with the IRCC Program delivery instructions on Renouncing permanent residence. \n \nFor further information, see ENF 23 Loss of permanent resident status. \n \n \n11 Procedure: Gathering evidence for the A44(1) report \n \n11.1 Evidentiary requirements \n \nOfficers should be mindful that any piece of evidence gathered may be used at an admissibility \nhearing. All evidence gathered should therefore be of a quality sufficient to satisfy the MD, or \nthe ID member, of the person’s inadmissibility. \n \nOfficers must take steps in all cases to provide adequate documentation to substantiate the \ninadmissibility allegation(s) in a report and evidence must be on file to support all elements of \nthe inadmissibility. Files should not be forwarded to the MD or to the Hearings Officer (where \njurisdiction lies with the ID) unless all evidence substantiating the allegation is on file, except in \nrare circumstances. In such cases, officers will record in the case notes the attempts that were \nmade to obtain the evidence, so that the MD or the Hearings Officer, if applicable, may follow \nup, where it is agreed that this is appropriate. This is especially important in cases where \ndetention is also being pursued.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n37 \n \n \nFor further information on obtaining evidence and determining equivalency, see ENF 1 \nInadmissibility and ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility \n \n11.2 Evidentiary requirement: Proof of status in Canada  \n \nUnder the IRPA, Canadian citizens and persons registered as Indians under the Indian Act have \nan unqualified right to enter and remain in Canada and are not subject to the inadmissibility \nprovisions of the IRPA. Therefore, before writing an A44(1) report, an officer must have \nevidence to confirm that the person does not hold such status in Canada. In cases of permanent \nresidents, officers must confirm through the appropriate queries that the person has not \nobtained Canadian citizenship and ensure that due diligence has been exercised before \nproceeding with further enforcement action.  \n \nFor permanent residents, the officer must also obtain documentary evidence to establish that \nthe person holds such status in Canada. For further information, see ENF 1 Inadmissibility and \nENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility \n \nNote:  Due to the possibility of duplicate identities in GCMS, officers should conduct full name \nqueries in the GCMS Integrated Search view to ensure accurate information is obtained. \n \n11.3 Persons claiming to be Canadian citizens or registered Indians under the \nIndian Act \n \nUnder the IRPA, Canadian citizens and persons registered as Indians under the Indian Act have \nan unqualified right to enter and remain in Canada and are not subject to the inadmissibility \nprovisions of IRPA. Therefore, before writing an A44(1) report, an officer should have evidence \nto confirm that the person does not hold such status. \n \nIn cases of permanent residents, officers must confirm through the appropriate queries that the \nperson has not obtained Canadian citizenship and ensure that due diligence has been \nexercised before proceeding with further enforcement action. \n \nShould an officer detect the possibility of Canadian citizenship or registered Indian status, the \nofficer shall investigate or cause an investigation of the matter to be initiated before taking any \nfurther steps to write a report or refer the case to an MD. \n \nIn questioning persons in this regard, officers should be fully cognizant of the Citizenship Act \nand/or make contact with a citizenship officer who can provide assistance and guidance. \nShould a person claiming to be a Canadian citizen make a refugee claim to an officer, the officer \nmust ascertain whether that person is indeed a Canadian citizen. If such is the case, the officer \nshould advise the person that Canadian citizens may not make a refugee claim, as they already \nenjoy the protection of Canadian citizenship and the right to enter and remain in Canada.  \n \n11.4 Procedure: Overview of the examination process \n \nThe procedural requirements and legal obligations related to gathering information from the \nperson for the purpose of writing an A44(1) report will depend on whether the person is still \nsubject to examination.  \n \nPursuant to A15(1), individuals who make applications under the IRPA are subject to an\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n38 \n \n \nexamination for various reasons, including to determine whether that person has a right to enter \nCanada or may become authorized to enter or remain in Canada pursuant to A18(1).  \n \nR28 provides that, for the purposes of A15(1), a person makes an application to an officer by: \n \n• \nsubmitting an application in writing; \n• \nseeking to enter Canada; \n• \nseeking to transit through Canada as provided in R35; or \n• \nmaking a claim for refugee protection. \n \nWhere the person makes an application, there is a legal obligation under  A16(1) to answer \ntruthfully all questions put to them by an officer for the purpose of the examination, and produce \nall documents or other evidence reasonably required. \n \nMoreover, pursuant to A16(1.1), a person who makes an application must, on request of an \nofficer, appear in person for an examination.  The power to compel someone to submit to an \nexamination under 16(1.1) may be used overseas, inland and at ports of entry. \n \n For foreign nationals, the requirement to produce evidence may extend to the provision of \nphotographic and fingerprint evidence [A16(2)]. \n Pursuant to A16(2.1), a foreign national who makes an application must, on request of an \nofficer, appear for an interview for the purpose of an investigation conducted by the \nCanadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and must answer truthfully all questions put \nto them during the interview. Officers should note, however, that the power to compel for a \nCSIS interview under A16(2.1) can only be used for inland and port of entry applications. \n  \nFor further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations (section 5, ‘Examinations’) \n \n11.5 End of examination \n \nThe IRPR provide that an examination begins “when a person makes an application to the \nofficer.” Persons seeking to enter Canada are considered to have made an application pursuant \nto R28(b) as they are “seeking to enter Canada”. \n \nR37 specifies the point at which the examination of a person who seeks to enter Canada, or \nmakes an application to transit through Canada, ends. In general terms, examinations will end \nwhen an officer makes a decision on the application before them or, in cases referred to the \nMD, when a decision has been made.  \n \nAt a port of entry, with the exception of refugee claimants, persons seeking to enter or transit \nthrough Canada remain subject to an examination until: \n \n(a) a determination is made that the person has a right to enter Canada, or is authorized \nto enter Canada as a temporary resident or permanent resident, the person is authorized \nto leave the port of entry at which the examination takes place and the person leaves the \nport of entry; \n(b) if the person is an in-transit passenger, the person departs from Canada; \n(c) the person is authorized to withdraw their application to enter Canada and an officer \nverifies their departure from Canada; or \n(d) a decision in respect of the person is made under subsection 44(2) of the Act and the \nperson leaves the port of entry.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n39 \n \n \n \nThis means that during an examination at a port of entry the person may be brought back to an \nofficer for a re-examination of their admissibility and appropriate action could be taken until the \nexamination is complete. Such re-examinations may result in an A44(1) report.  \n \nIt should be noted by officers at the port of entry that while permanent residents are subject to \nexamination when seeking entry, the IRPA gives permanent residents of Canada the right to \nenter Canada at a port of entry pursuant to A19(2) once the officer is satisfied that the person \nholds permanent resident status. The obligation to answer truthfully under A16(1) for permanent \nresidents is linked to A18(1) and must be related to examination for the purpose of establishing \nthat the person holds permanent resident status in Canada.   \n \nWhile an officer who is satisfied at examination that a person holds permanent resident status \nmust admit that person, the officer may also form an opinion during examination that the \npermanent resident is inadmissible for other reasons under the IRPA. In such cases, the officer \nshould advise the person that while it has been established that they have a right to enter \nCanada, there are reasons to believe that they could become the subject of a report under the \nIRPA which could lead to the issuance of a removal order. If the person wishes to continue \nanswering questions or providing information/submissions pertaining to the allegation, they \nshould be given an opportunity but are not required to do so. Even if a permanent resident \nbecomes the subject of an A44(1) report, they continue to have a right to enter until a final \ndetermination has been made regarding their loss of status. \n \nFor further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations (section 5.6, ‘End of examination’ \nand section 11.4, ‘Investigating permanent residents for inadmissibility’) \n \n11.6 Procedure: End of examination for refugee claimants \n  \nThe point at which examination ends is different where the person is a refugee claimant as the \napplication exists up until the claim has been decided. \n \nR37(2) provides designated officers the authority to examine a refugee claimant until a decision \nis made in regards to the claim. \n \nEnd of examination — claim for refugee protection \n \n(2) The examination of a person who makes a claim for refugee protection at a port of entry or \ninside Canada other than at a port of entry ends when the later of the following occurs: \n \n(a) an officer determines that their claim is ineligible under section 101 of the Act or the Refugee \nProtection Division accepts or rejects their claim under section 107 of the Act; \n \n(b) a decision in respect of the person is made under subsection 44(2) of the Act and, in the case \nof a claim made at a port of entry, the person leaves the port of entry. \n \nThis means that even after a claim is determined eligible and referred to the Refugee Protection \nDivision (RPD), officers may compel a refugee claimant to appear for an examination to verify \nand/or obtain information from the refugee claimant as the circumstances warrant, even where \nthe initial examination took place at the port of entry. However, the circumstances under which a \nclaimant is directed to answer questions or produce evidence related to ineligibility should be \nlimited to the scope of the inadmissibility section or exclusion grounds being investigated. The\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n40 \n \n \npurpose of the examination should be related to identity or grounds of ineligibility, such as \nserious inadmissibility [A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1) or A37] or exclusion under section E or section \nF of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention.   \n \nDuring the examination, officers (including inland officers) will be able to question the refugee \nclaimant for the purposes of the examination and require the claimant to produce all relevant \nevidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires, as new information or evidence \nbecomes available while the claim is in process. \n \n Officers should be mindful that where the refugee protection hearing is underway by the \nRPD, the authority to examine under R37(2) should proceed in a manner that does not \ninterfere with the refugee protection hearing.  \n Concerns relating to the merits of the claim, or a refugee claimant's general credibility \nshould not be the purpose of the examination. Instead, matters relating to the merits of the \nclaim or credibility shall be raised before the RPD in the context of a Ministerial intervention \n(see section 14.5,  ‘Overview: Minister's opinions/interventions’) \n At ports of entry, if a refugee claimant is determined to be ineligible to be referred to the \nRefugee Protection Division, the claimant continues to be under examination until: (i) a \ndecision in respect of the person is made under A44(2), and (ii) leaves the port of entry. For \ninformation concerning port of entry immigration \"end of examinations\", refer to ENF 4 Port \nof Entry Examinations. \n At inland offices, if a refugee claimant is determined to be ineligible to be referred to the \nRPD, the authority to examine the claimant ends, pursuant to R37(2)(a). Should additional \ninformation be required from the person to gather additional evidence necessary for an \nadmissibility hearing before the ID, or to enforce a removal order, it may be collected under \nthe authority provided in A16(3)- where arrested, detained, or subject to examination or a \nremoval order.  Otherwise, the officer may request an in-person interview where determined \nto be appropriate (See also: section 11.7, ‘Procedure: Gathering evidence for persons not \nsubject to examination’). \n It should be noted that when refugee claimants have identified a counsel of record in their \nBasis of Claim (BOC) form or elsewhere in the record of the RPD, they have a right to have \ncounsel present at an interview held in respect of their refugee claim. Counsel are to be \nnotified of and given an opportunity to be present for any interview conducted for the \npurpose of gathering evidence for the refugee hearing (post-eligibility).  \n \nNote: this is to be distinguished from IRPA interviews for other purposes. A refugee claimant \ndoes not have a right to counsel at an interview relating to their eligibility to claim refugee \nstatus. \n \nSee Appendix A:  Sample call-in letter for interview - Refugee claimant \n \n11.7 Procedure: Gathering evidence for persons not subject to examination \n \nWhere the person is no longer subject to examination, there is no legal obligation under A16 to \nprovide information, however officers may request that the person voluntarily attend an interview \nin order to gather evidence and information for the purpose of determining whether an A44(1) \nreport will be written and referred. In such cases, including cases for permanent residents, the \ncall-in notice should state the purpose of the interview and follow the procedural fairness \nguidelines noted earlier in this manual. \n \nAs noted in preceding sections, permanent residents benefit from a higher degree of\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n41 \n \n \nparticipatory rights during the A44(1) process.  \n \n11.8 Procedure: In-person interview (all cases) \n \nWhere proceeding by way of an in-person interview, officers must always ensure that the \nperson concerned understands the proceedings. For that purpose, the officer must provide the \nperson concerned with an interpreter if required. \n \nThe person concerned must also be given the opportunity to have counsel present at the \ninterview. This is not to be confused with an unqualified right to have counsel present, however \nas already set out in section 6.5, detained individuals have the right to have a counsel of their \nchoosing present during the interview. Officers must inform persons of their right to counsel \nprior to commencing the interview. This right applies in all cases where a person is detained \nunder an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the criminal \ncourts while facing charges or serving a sentence. As stated in previous sections, all detained \ncases should be interviewed in person. \n \nSee Appendix D:  Sample Call-in letter for interview- Person no longer subject to \nexamination (includes permanent resident and protected person) \n \nReasonable efforts should be made to ensure that the notification letter is delivered to the most \ncurrent address of the person concerned. Where appropriate, this may include a site visit and/or \ntelephone call. This will be particularly important in cases where the loss of appeal rights under \nA64 may be involved. See section 11.10, ‘Procedure:  Failure to appear at A44(1) interview’. \n \n11.9 Procedure for submissions where no in-person interview is held: Persons no \nlonger subject to examination \n \nThe Federal Court affirmed in Hernandez v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness), 2007 FC 725, a case involving a permanent resident of Canada, that an oral \ninterview by the officer at the A44(1) stage is not always required, as long as the affected \nperson is given an opportunity to make submissions and to know the case against them. This \nprinciple was affirmed in Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n[2017] 3 FCR 492, 2016 FCA 319. In that case, the FCA also confirmed that the duty of fairness \ndoes not require that the A44(1) report is put before the person before a decision is made by the \nMD to refer that report to the ID pursuant to A44(2), provided that such a report is \ncommunicated to the affected person before the hearing of the Immigration Division. In other \nwords, officers must ensure that the report under A44(1) is provided to the person concerned \nbefore the hearing of the ID. As a matter of practice, disclosure of the report will usually occur at \nthe time that the admissibility hearing package is served on the permanent resident by a \nHearings Officer or Hearings Advisor in advance of the hearing, in accordance with the ID Rules \nfor disclosure. \n \nWhere an officer elects not to proceed by way of an in-person interview and elects to proceed \nby way of written submissions, the officer must notify the person concerned in writing of the \nallegation and the process to be followed, and provide them with an opportunity and reasonable \ntime to provide submissions and information related to their case.  \n \nSee Appendix B:   Sample letter to be sent where no interview is requested- Person no \nlonger subject to examination (includes permanent resident and protected person)\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n42 \n \n \n \nWhere proceeding by way of written submissions, an officer may also choose to provide a \nquestionnaire to the person concerned in order to facilitate the process and provide an \ninformation guideline to assist the person concerned.  \n \nSee Appendix C:  Sample Questionnaire \n \nNote: For submissions in writing, sufficient time shall be allowed for receipt by regular mail. or \nexample, if the deadline for receipt is 15 days, an officer should not make a decision on day 15, \nbut shall wait an additional seven days to allow for mail delays.  \n \nWhere the person concerned makes a request for an extension of time to provide \nsubmissions, the officer shall reasonably consider such a request, having full regard to the \ncircumstances of the person concerned and the reasons for the request. The officer’s decision \nmust be issued in writing and provided to the person concerned. \n \nAs already noted, permanent residents (and foreign nationals who are no longer subject to \nexamination) cannot be compelled to provide submissions or otherwise be required to \nparticipate in the A44(1) process. Where reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the \nperson concerned has been notified of the A44 process and no submissions are received or the \nperson concerned has expressly declined to participate in the A44(1) process, the officer may \nproceed to write an A44(1) report based on all relevant evidence available and refer the report \nto be reviewed by an MD under A44(2).    \n \n11.10 Procedure:  Failure to appear at A44(1) interview \n \nIf the person concerned does not appear for an interview on the date specified in the call-in \nletter and the responsible officer and/or office where the A44(1) investigation originated has not \nreceived notice or other indication from the person concerned stating why they were unable to \nattend the interview, then officers should make reasonable efforts to locate the person, including \nreasonable efforts to determine the reasons for the no-show (e.g., letter to the last known \naddress, site visit and/or telephone call). This will be particularly important in cases where the \nloss of appeal rights under A64 may be involved. \n \nIn all cases where the loss of appeal rights under A64 may be involved, where the person \nconcerned was not originally called in for an in-person interview, and no further \nsubmissions/information have been received within the specified timeframe, it is recommended \nthat the officer attempt to interview the person concerned, either by telephone or in person, \nbefore taking further enforcement action. This will ensure that the person concerned is aware of \nthe fact that they may not have appeal rights in their case should a removal order be issued. \n \nWhere an interview is not possible because the person concerned refuses to meet or talk with \nan officer, the officer must keep a record of the efforts made to gather the information and the \nefforts to provide sufficient time for the person concerned to submit the information for \nconsideration. \n \nWhere, after making reasonable efforts, the officer has been unable to locate the person \nconcerned and no correspondence or submissions have been received on their behalf, the \nofficer may still proceed to write the A44(1) report based on all relevant evidence available and \nrefer the report to be reviewed by an MD under A44(2).\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n43 \n \n \n12 Evidence gathering:  Additional considerations \n \n12.1 Serious inadmissibilities [A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1), A37] \n \nIt is important to balance the requirement to gather information according to the considerations \noutlined in the preceding sections and the need to protect the safety of Canadian society. There \nmay be cases where an officer is pursuing enforcement under the IRPA for serious \ninadmissibility and the person constitutes either a danger to the public or a significant flight risk. \nFor example, criminal intelligence exists that the person is committing crimes of a violent nature, \nis a security risk or is involved in organized crime, etc. In such cases where an arrest and \ndetention is necessary, it may be appropriate that the A44(1) report be written and a decision to \nrefer the matter to the ID be made without advising the client prior to the arrest. In such \nexceptional cases, officers must first document their recommendation, consult with their \nmanager regarding this proposed course of action and receive concurrence before proceeding. \nIf an arrest takes place, the officer will then provide the individual with a copy of the A44(1) \nreport. If the matter concerns a permanent resident or a protected person and they wish to \nmake submissions at that point, the officers will provide them with a reasonable opportunity to \ndo so and will forward the submission to the MD for review.  \n \n12.2 Evidence of pending or withdrawn charges \n \nOfficers must be careful about how they rely on evidence of charges which did not lead to a \nconviction. In McAlpin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 422, \nChief Justice Crampton held that in exercising discretion to refer an individual for admissibility \nhearing, it is reasonable for the Minister or his delegate to place significant weight on the \nnumber of interactions that a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report has had with the law. \nJustice Crampton also found that while the Federal Court has previously found that pending or \nwithdrawn charges may be considered by an officer or an MD in determinations under A44(1) \nand A44(2) and certain other contexts that arise under the IRPA, provided that such evidence is \nfound to be credible and trustworthy14, officers must be mindful that there are limitations to the \nway such evidence is used and officers should not treat the existence of withdrawn charges on \ntheir face as evidence of a person’s history of criminality.   \n \nOfficers must also be careful not to rely on convictions for which rehabilitation or a record \nsuspension has been granted as evidence of a criminal record. \n \n12.3 Offences under the Youth Criminal Justice Act  \n \nOfficers must ensure that they do not rely on or refer to youth offences in their determination, \nexcept where access is authorized under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). Information \nthat is not accessible under the provisions of the YCJA cannot be considered and must not be \nincluded or referenced at any point during A44 proceedings. Moreover, contravention of the \nprovisions of the YCJA is a serious matter. \n \nThe importance of verifying whether information is protected by YCJA provisions was \nhighlighted in Abdi v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 2017 FC 950. In \n                                                \n14 Sittampalam v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FCA 326; Thuraisingam v \nCanada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 607; Kharrat v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n2007 FC 842\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n44 \n \n \nthat case, the Federal Court held that the MD did not commit an error in relying on youth crimes \nthat the applicant was found guilty of where access to these records was not restricted by virtue \nof section 119(9) of the YCJA. However, the MD’s reliance on youth offences that were \nwithdrawn or dismissed was unreasonable since section 119(2)(c) of the YCJA allows access to \nthese records for only a brief period after dismissal or withdrawal of the youth charges and the \naccess period to such charges had expired. \n \nOfficers conducting A44(1) and A44(2) functions must ensure that they only rely on youth \nrecords to which access is not restricted under the YCJA. It is therefore important for officers to \nbe aware of the provisions of the YCJA which relate to access to youth records.  \n \n12.4 Privacy and information sharing \n \nWhile information sharing is vital to protecting the safety and security of Canadians, the sharing \nof information must be done in a manner which complies with Canada's laws and legal \nobligations. When obtaining and disclosing information obtained from a third party, including a \nforeign government, officers must be aware of their legal obligations under information sharing \nagreements and legislation. In all cases, officers are required to assess the accuracy and \nreliability of information received, and properly characterize this information in any further \ndissemination.  \n \nAll information sharing activities must also comply with the Security of Canada Information \nDisclosure Act (SCIDA)15. The SCIDA provides the authorities for all Government of Canada \ninstitutions respecting the disclosure of information related to national security, including \npersonal information, in order to protect Canada against activities that undermine the security of \nCanada. \n \nWhen obtaining or assessing evidence at A44, officers must ensure that any and all information \nsharing activities comply with applicable information sharing legislation as well as all relevant \ndepartmental and agency information sharing policies. For further information, CBSA and IRCC \nofficers should consult their respective Agency/Departmental information sharing guidance, \npolicies and toolkits. \n \n12.4.1 Evidence obtained by mistreatment or torture \n \nIn addition to ensuring that information is shared in a manner that complies with Canada's laws \nand legal obligations, officers must avoid knowingly contributing to mistreatment of persons by \nforeign entities. Bill C-59 gained Royal Assent in June 2019, thereby establishing the Avoiding \nComplicity in Mistreatment by Foreign Entities Act (ACA). Pursuant to subsection 3(2) of the \nACA, a new Order in Council (OiC) issued to the CBSA in July 2019, which prescribes the \ndirections for avoiding complicity in mistreatment by foreign entities. The OiC prohibits: \n \n• \nthe disclosure of information that would result in a substantial risk of mistreatment of \nan individual by a foreign entity; \n• \nthe making of requests for information that would result in a substantial risk of \nmistreatment of an individual by a foreign entity; and \n                                                \n15 The Security of Canada Information Sharing Act (SCISA) was the previous legislation for national \nsecurity information sharing. SCISA was amended and renamed SCIDA after Bill C-59, An Act respecting \nnational security matters, received Royal Assent in June 2019.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n45 \n \n \n• \ncertain uses of information that was likely obtained through the mistreatment of an \nindividual by a foreign entity. \n \n12.4.2 Disclosure and procedural fairness considerations \n \nGenerally speaking, as a matter of procedural fairness, individuals subject to A44 proceedings \nhave the right to know the case against them, which includes understanding what information \nthe officer would rely on in making a decision. However, the Federal Court has recognized that \neach case must turn on its facts and that not every document considered by an officer must be \ndisclosed at the A44 stage. The main question is whether the person has had the opportunity to \nmeaningfully participate in the decision-making process [Karahroudi v Canada (Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2016 FC 522, [2017] 1 FCR 167; Gebremedhin v Canada (Minister of Citizenship \nand Immigration), 2013 FC 380; Bhagwandass v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2001 FCA 49]. \n \nOfficers should keep in mind that where there is relevant information before them which cannot \nbe disclosed to the person due to privacy or information sharing legislation, and where the \nofficer cannot obtain authorization to disclose the document with appropriate redactions, the \ninformation should not be relied upon in the officer’s reasons. There are exceptions where the \nduty of fairness can be met without having to furnish all the documents and reports the decision-\nmaker relied on, such as where a document is protected by privilege based on national security \nor on the solicitor-client relationship, however officers should be careful not to rely specifically \non documents which cannot be disclosed. This position is consistent with Federal Court \njurisprudence [for example, Moghaddam v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC \n1063].   \n \nWhere officers receive a request for disclosure of documents at the A44(1) stage, officers \nshould turn their minds to whether the information sought is “material and otherwise unknown \nand unavailable to the person concerned”. Where the information is not material (i.e., not \nbeing relied on in the offer’s assessment) or is otherwise known or available to the person \nconcerned (e.g., a person’s criminal court records which they could access through a request), \nthe officer is not subject to a duty to disclose and this may form the rationale for refusing to \ndisclose it. An officer may still need to refuse to disclose on other grounds. In all cases, it is \nimportant for the officer to provide a rationale for the refusal. [for further information, see Durkin \nv. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 174]. \n \nIn Jeffrey v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1180, the Federal \nCourt relied on Durkin and concluded that the Minister does not have a duty to disclose \ninformation other than that which is “material and otherwise unknown or unavailable to the \nperson” until after a decision has been made under A44(2) to hold an admissibility hearing. The \ncourt found that in the circumstances of the case, the officer was not subject to any duty to \nprovide the disclosure sought by the applicant where the applicant was: \n \nadvised of the reason why an inadmissibility report may be prepared pursuant to A44(1); \n \ninformed of the nature of the specific allegations being considered; \n \nprovided an opportunity to respond to those allegations;  \n \ninformed of what the relevant information in the officer’s possession consisted of; and  \n \nadvised that copies of the information sought would not be provided since the applicant \neither provided that information or was present during the interviews where the \ninformation was obtained.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n46 \n \n \nIn other words, in responding to such requests for information, officers should ensure that the \nA44(1) procedure is fair. \n \n12.5 Allegations of inadmissibility subsequent to a declaration under A42.1 \n \nA decision by the Minister to make a declaration under A42.1 means that the matters referred to \nin A34, A35(1)(b) or (c), or A37(1) do not constitute inadmissibility in respect of a foreign \nnational, but only in respect of the facts that were reasonably available at the time the Minister \nmade the declaration. Should a person who has been granted an exception pursuant to A42.1 \nsubsequently engage in activities that would render them inadmissible on the same or other \ngrounds, or should new and material facts omitted from the record considered by the Minister as \na result of an error or misrepresentation on the part of the person concerned come to the \nattention of the CBSA, an officer may prepare a report that sets out the relevant facts pursuant \nto A44(1). \n \nBefore making an allegation that the person is inadmissible on the grounds of A34, A35(1)(b) or \n(c), or A37(1), an officer should ensure that the basis of the allegation does not include solely \nthose facts that the Minister has already taken into consideration in granting a declaration under \nA42.1. \n \n \n \n13 Writing an A44(1) report –  Form and content \n \n13.1 A44(1) report requirements \n \nOfficers should be mindful that the A44(1) report is not evidence. It sets out the allegation and \nthe underlining facts necessary to support the allegation. The report should not contain \ninformation which is unrelated to the allegation (e.g., issues related to grounds for detention or \nthe person’s full immigration history) or opinions of the officer and should be restricted to facts \nwhich support the allegation. \n  \nSince the A44(1) report is an allegation, not evidence, any additional information obtained \nduring an interview which an officer wishes to include in support of the report should be \nprovided by way of a separate statutory declaration from the officer.  \n \nThe authority of the MD to cause an admissibility hearing or issue a removal order cannot be \nexercised unless the form and content of a report under A44(1) comply with specific \nrequirements and contain required information relating to the IRPA inadmissibility upon which \nthe report is based.  \n \nWhen an officer is of the opinion that a permanent resident or foreign national in Canada is \ninadmissible, then that officer may prepare a report under A44(1). \n \nThe report shall then be transmitted to the MD, along with any forms containing the officer’s \ndisposition, recommendation and rationale. This may be best accomplished by preparing an \nA44(1) case highlights form IMM 5084B  (for inland cases) or BSF516 (for port of entry cases). \nFor more complex cases, this may also be accomplished by way of a detailed memorandum or \nA44(1) narrative report (e.g., for permanent residents and protected persons).  See also: section \n14.2, ‘Referral of a report to the Minister’s Delegate’.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n47 \n \n \n \nAll A44(1) reports must: \n \n \nbe in writing and must indicate the place and date of issue; \n \nbe addressed to the Minister of PS or the Minister of IRCC and be signed by the officer who \nconducted the examination or is otherwise making the report; \n \ncontain the complete name (correctly spelled) of the person who is being reported; \n \ncontain the exact subsection(s)/paragraph(s) of the IRPA (and IRPR, if applicable) upon \nwhich the officer based the opinion that the person, who is the subject of the A44(1) report, \nis inadmissible; \n \ninclude a narrative section that justifies the inadmissibility opinion and cites the facts upon \nwhich that opinion is based. The narrative section must indicate the exact grounds for \napplying the particular inadmissibility section(s): these grounds are set out below the words:  \n      “This report is based on the following information that the above-named individual:”. \n \nFor example, in applying A36(2)(b), it is not sufficient to state that the person has been \nconvicted of an offence. The report must fully specify the grounds of inadmissibility in the \nfollowing manner: \n \nThis report is based on the following information that the above-named individual:  \n \nAlso known as (list other names used, where applicable)  \n-Is not a Canadian citizen; is not a permanent resident of Canada; is not a registered \nIndian under the Indian Act; \n…has been convicted of an offence; namely, [Possession of Cocaine] on or about [22 \nNovember 1982] at or near [Pontiac, Michigan, USA]. This offence, if committed in \nCanada, would constitute an offence that may be punishable by way of indictment under \nparagraph 4(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and for which a maximum \nterm of imprisonment [not exceeding seven years] may be imposed. \n \nSee also ENF 1 Inadmissibility; and ENF 2 Evaluating inadmissibility.    \n                                                                                                                                     \n13.2 Entering the A44(1) report into the Global Case Management System       \n(GCMS)  \n \nAll A44(1) reports are generated in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) under the \n‘Examination’ process.   \n  \nOfficers must take care to avoid errors during the data entry process as the written report is a \nlegal document and may be closely scrutinized not only by the MD, but also by Hearings \nOfficers, members of the IRB, and even Federal or Supreme Court of Canada justices. \n \nWhen officers enter a report into GCMS, they must ensure that the proper allegations are \nselected and that the dispositions of the examination process are accurately staged. Officers \nmust review the contents of the narrative section of the report before finalizing the document. \nFor technical instructions on GCMS processes and detailed instructions on how to enter a report \ninto GCMS, officers should reference their IT Tools and guidelines. \n \nFor CBSA officers, step by step instructions are available in the GCMS Help Centre.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n48 \n \n \nNote:  Officers must also ensure that the report as well as the investigation process leading up \nto the report are recorded and updated in the National Case Management System (NCMS) in \noffices where NCMS is utilized. \n \n13.3 A44(1) reports for non-compliance with IRPA requirements – A41 \n \nUnder A41, a person is inadmissible for failing to comply with “this Act.” Pursuant to A2(2), \nunless otherwise indicated, references in the IRPA to “this Act” include the Regulations made \nunder it. \n  \nIt is important to note that a non-compliance allegation must be coupled with a specific \nrequirement of either the IRPA or the IRPR; it is not meant to be, nor should it be, a “stand-\nalone” allegation. This means that the report must cite both A41 and the specific IRPA provision \nthat is the subject of the non-compliance (i.e., provision of the IRPA or the IRPR contravened); \nthis structure is necessary in order to determine whether the jurisdiction to issue a removal \norder falls under the MD (R228) or the ID (R229).   \n \nOfficers must also include the specific grounds for the non-compliance in the comments of the \nnarrative portion of the A44(1) report, under the heading: “This report is based on the following \ninformation that the above-named individual:”. In other words, the description of the particular \ncontravention of an IRPA requirement (e.g., person’s failure to leave Canada by the end of the \nperiod authorized for their stay) and any specific reference to a provision of the IRPA or the \nIRPR  are to be incorporated in the officer’s narrative justifying the inadmissibility allegation.  \n \nFor further information on the elements of non-compliance under A41, see ENF 2/OP18 \nEvaluating Inadmissibility. \n \n13.4 Multiple allegations \n \nWhere the person is inadmissible under multiple provisions of the IRPA, it is generally \nrecommended that the officer writes a separate report for each allegation. The MD will then \nmake a determination on each report during the A44(2) process.  \n \nIf an officer is considering whether to write two separate inadmissibility reports on the same \nperson, and if the objectives of the IRPA would not be further served by pursuing a removal \norder for an additional allegation for which the ID has jurisdiction, then the officer may use \ndiscretion and not write an A44(1) report containing the allegation for which the ID has \njurisdiction [R228(1) and R229(1)]. For example, an allegation may not be worth pursuing \nbecause it will not affect the eligibility of a claim for refugee protection under A101, or because \nthe MD may issue an exclusion order based on the other allegations and there is no concern \nthat the person will be able to return to Canada without consent after one year.  However, it is \nimportant to keep in mind the objectives of the IRPA: depending on the circumstances of the \ncase, these objectives may be best served by writing an A44(1) report as a future record of the \ninadmissibility. In such cases, an officer may choose to write the A44(1) report but recommend \nno further action as the A44(2) disposition. \n \nThere may be instances where an officer, after preparing or reviewing an A44(1) report, finds: \n \n \nthat the grounds cited in the report are not valid, but in the officer’s opinion, the person \nfalls within some other inadmissible class; or\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n49 \n \n \n \nthere is an additional ground of inadmissibility \nIn such cases, the officer will need to prepare a new A44(1) report and forward the \naccompanying documents and evidence to the MD. The officer cannot simply amend the \nexisting A44(1) report. Whether a new A44(1) report is written to replace a previous report or to \nreport a new inadmissibility ground, in either case the officer must ensure that the person \nconcerned is accorded the earliest possible notice of all the grounds against them in \naccordance with the rules of natural justice. \n \nIf an officer, during the course of an investigation, comes across evidence to support new \nallegations which fall within the jurisdiction of the ID where an existing A44(1) report has already \nbeen referred to the ID, the officer should contact the Hearings Officer to determine next steps, \nincluding whether the additional grounds of inadmissibility should be dealt with at the hearing \nsimultaneously.  \n \nThere may be instances where multiple allegations are contained within the same report. This \npractice is generally discouraged, especially where the jurisdiction for each inadmissibility does \nnot lie with the same decision-maker (i.e., MD or ID). It should be noted, however, that where a \nreport contains one or more inadmissibility allegation, and if the MD has jurisdiction for all \ninadmissibility allegations contained within that report, the MD can determine the disposition of \nthat report. Conversely, where there are several inadmissibility allegations in a report and the \nMD has jurisdiction for only some of them, the MD is not authorized to determine a disposition \nfor that report, and all allegations must be referred to the ID. \n \nAs set out in section 8 above, discretion under A44 means that officers and MDs have some \nflexibility in managing cases where the person is inadmissible, and assessing whether the \nobjectives of the IRPA may or will be achieved without the need to seek a removal order or write \na formal inadmissibility report under A44(1). Officers should note, however, that where the same \nevidence supports multiple allegations of inadmissibility, they should consider the fact that not \npursuing a particular allegation until a later date may give rise to an abuse of process argument \nby the person concerned. This does not mean an A44(1) report should be written in \ncircumstances where the officer is still in the process of gathering further evidence in relation to \none or more inadmissibility ground, and officers will need to balance whether the objectives of \nthe IRPA would be served by writing a report for all possible allegations or proceeding with only \ncertain allegations at a given point in time.  \n \nExample:  A CBSA officer is investigating a permanent resident for inadmissibility for serious \ncriminality under A36(1)(b). The CBSA officer has obtained evidence to support an A44(1) \nreport for the allegation, but has determined that the evidence further supports an A44(1) report \nfor A40(1)(a) based on misrepresentation on the person’s application for permanent residence. \nIt may later be seen or determined by the Courts to be an abuse of process if the officer does \nnot pursue the A40(1)(a) report at the same time as the A36(1)(b) report. On the other hand, \nusing this same scenario as an example, if the officer is also investigating possible \ninadmissibility for organized criminality under A37(1)(a) but is still in the process of gathering \nevidence to establish this allegation, abuse of process is less likely to arise, even if there is \noverlapping evidence in both allegations. In this situation, however, the officer should consider \nwhether to wait until the investigation into the A37(1)(a) allegation is complete before \nproceeding to write the report for A36(1)(b)/ referring it to the MD.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n50 \n \n \n14 Procedures after the A44(1) report is written \n \n14.1 Providing the A44(1) report to the person concerned \n \nIn order to comply with natural justice, persons who are reported under A44(1) should fully \nunderstand both the case against them, and the nature and purpose of the report. Wherever \npossible, an officer who writes an A44(1) report must also provide a copy of that report to the \nperson concerned.  \n \nIn cases where a report is prepared as a consequence of an examination (such as at a port of \nentry) or in any other case where the person concerned is on site and/or otherwise available to \nreceive a copy of the report, then a copy of the report should be given to the person concerned. \nIn such cases, officers should also counsel a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report on \nthe following matters, as appropriate:  \n \n \nthe reason why the report was prepared (or in the case of an R41 “Direct Back,” may \nbe prepared); \n \nthe date and time the person should return if the MD was not available to consider a \nreport prepared (or that may be prepared) if the person chooses to return and pursue \ntheir entry request with respect to that person [R41(b)]; \n \nif the review by the MD is to be conducted at a place other than where the report was \ncompleted, appropriate instructions, such as where the office is located and how to \nget there; \n \nthe purpose of the review and the options available to the MD. \n \nWhere entry seems justified in the circumstances, officers should also inform persons about the \noption to apply for a TRP and about the cost recovery fee. For further information, see IP 1 \nTemporary Resident Permits; and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \nFor inland cases, where the MD has jurisdiction to issue the removal order, disclosure of the \nreport may occur at the time of the MD review under A44(2). Where the ID has jurisdiction, \ndisclosure of the report may occur at the time the admissibility hearing disclosure package is \nserved on the person concerned. As mentioned in previous sections, the Federal Court of \nAppeal has confirmed that the duty of fairness does not require that the A44(1) report is put \nbefore the person before a decision is made by the MD to refer that report to the ID pursuant to  \nA44(2) as long as the affected person is given an opportunity to make submissions and to know \nthe case against them. (See also: section 11.9, ‘Procedure for submissions where no in-person \ninterview is held: Persons no longer subject to examination’). \n \n14.2 Referral of the A44(1) report to the Minister’s Delegate  \n   \nAll A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents and foreign nationals must be referred to the \nMD who will make the final decision about whether or not to issue a removal order (if within the \nMD’s jurisdiction) or refer the matter to the ID. Where the officer has also prepared an A44(1) \ncase highlights form (IMM 5084B for inland cases or BSF516 for port of entry cases), a detailed \nmemorandum or an A44(1) narrative report, this must also accompany the A44(1) report.  \nWhere the officer prepares one of these documents to set out their recommendation and \nrationale, such a document should include:  \n \n• \nthe person's identity, with name, aliases, date and place of birth, citizenship, marital\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n51 \n \n \nstatus, present immigration status, and details of passports and travel documents; \n• \nthe officer’s opinion based on the assessment of the criteria outlined in the sections \nabove and the recommendation(s);  \n• \nany submissions received from the person or notes taken at the interview; and, if \napplicable, the reasons for any delay in submitting the report. \n  \nThe officer must also forward, where applicable, any other documentation relied on by the \nofficer, including but not limited to: \n \n• \nfor permanent residents, proof of a search of citizenship records \n• \ncopies of all relevant immigration documents and other certificates and affidavits that \ncan be obtained from IRCC, if applicable; \n• \noriginals or copies of other documents relevant to the case, such as a birth \ncertificate, marriage certificate, a certificate of conviction or other evidence of a \nprevious conviction that is acceptable in a court of law; \n• \npolice occurrence reports; \n• \nprobation, parole and psychiatric assessments; \n• \npolice records and information on other convictions not reportable under A44(1); \n• \ndetails of the violations, and the first possible parole or release date if the person is \nserving a sentence; \n• \nother documentary evidence pertaining to the allegation(s), including all the evidence \nor submissions received from the person concerned. \n \nThis means that even if the officer at A44(1) does not exercise their discretion to consider \npersonal circumstances, all evidence and submissions received from the person concerned \nmust still be forwarded to the MD. \n \nNote:  When submitting certificates of conviction, officers are to ensure that the conviction (as \nopposed to the original charge) meets the equivalency requirements of the inadmissibility \nallegation. \n \nSee also, ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating inadmissibility; and ENF 23 Loss of \npermanent resident status. \n \nThe importance of forwarding the officer’s recommendation to the MD at the same time as the \nA44(1) report was highlighted in Wong v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2011 FC 971.  \nIn that case, the Federal Court dealt with the legality of two removal orders issued by the MD \nprior to the A44 case highlights form being signed and dated. In finding that this sequence of \nevents rendered the orders improperly issued and therefore null and void, the Court affirmed \nthat the officer’s recommendation needed to be reviewed by the MD as part of the A44 process \nbefore a removal order was issued.     \n \nIt is in the officer’s recommendation and rationale [contained in the A44(1) case highlights form, \ndetailed memorandum or A44(1) narrative report] that the officer will set out the recommended \ndisposition to the MD at the 44(2) proceedings, including but not limited to: \n \n \nIssuance of a removal order by the MD (cases within MD jurisdiction under R228); \n \nReferral to the ID for an admissibility hearing (cases within ID jurisdiction under R229) \n \nAllowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada (Port of entry only); see section 9.4, \n‘Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed to leave (Port of entry   \n   \ncases)’;\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n52 \n \n \n \nIssuance of a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) (Port of entry only); for further \ninformation on TRPs, see section 9.7, ‘Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) - Port of \nentry and IRCC only’; \n \nIssuance of a warning letter (inland- permanent residents and protected persons only); \nfor further information on warning letters, see ENF 6 Review of reports under A44(2). \n \n14.3 Procedure: Referring A44(1) reports when a Minister’s Delegate is not on site \n \nThe IRPA requires that A44(1) reports be transmitted to the MD after being prepared: officers \ncannot prepare and then review their own A44(1) report. There may be circumstances where an \nMD is not physically on site and/or otherwise available to conduct a review under A44(2) in \nperson and where deferring the MD review is not a viable option.  In such circumstances, \nofficers shall refer to ENF 6, section 10.7, ‘ Procedure: Reviewing A44(1) reports when a \nMinister’s Delegate is not on site’. \n \n14.4 Amending the A44(1) report \n \nThere is no mechanism to directly amend an existing A44(1) report in GCMS, therefore at the \ntime the report is being created, officers must ensure that the proper allegations are selected \nand the contents of the narrative section of the A44(1) report are accurate before finalizing the \ndocument.  \n \nThere are instances, however, where errors in an A44(1) report are identified following a review \nof the report after its issuance has been finalized. In such cases, it is important for officers to \ntake appropriate steps to make necessary corrections, taking into account the nature of the \nerror/information to be changed and the stage during which the error is identified.     \n \nWhere, following the issuance of the A44(1) report, an error is identified which does not affect \nthe substance of the report (for example, a typographical error regarding the date of a \nconviction) or it is determined that a change is warranted with respect to the wording in the \nnarrative section of the report, the officer who issued the original A44(1) report may write an \nupdated report in GCMS reflecting the appropriate corrections prior to review by the MD. Where \nthe error is discovered by the MD, it remains open to the MD to send the matter back to the \nofficer so that appropriate corrections may be made or for the officer to consider writing a new \nA44(1) report. In such cases, where a new A44(1) report is written to replace an existing report, \nofficers must ensure the previous report is cancelled in GCMS in accordance with the  \nprocedures set out in the GCMS guidelines, including the creation of any process notes as \nrequired. In such cases, the person concerned should be provided with a copy of the amended \nreport in accordance with the procedural fairness requirements outlined in previous sections of \nthese guidelines at some point prior to the proceeding that may result in the issuance of a \nremoval order (e.g., Minister’s Delegate review or admissibility hearing). \n \nNote:  There is a specific process to be followed in GCMS where the MD decides to return the \nA44(1) to the officer. Based on errors or new information identified by the MD, the officer may \ncreate a new A44(1) report by following GCMS procedures for issuing a new A44 report after \nMD returns the report to an officer.  \n \nCBSA officers may consult the GCMS Help Centre for guidance on GCMS procedures where \nthe MD returns the A44 report to an officer.   \n \nIt is also important to note that there are circumstances in which amendments to an A44(1)\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n53 \n \n \nreport may be made after the report has been referred to the ID, without the need for a new \nreferral under A44(2). While it is generally preferred that amendments be made by way of \nwriting a new A44(1) report containing the amended wording, there may be circumstances \nwhere amendments to the report can be made at the admissibility hearing stage, however, this \nis only possible where the amendment does not affect the substance of the report. For example, \nin Clare v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2016 FC 545, the Minister filed a Notice of \nAmendment to the A44(1) report, after the report had already been referred to the ID. The notice \nitself stated that the amendment did not represent a change in the substance of the original \nreport. The narrative section of the revised version replaced the reference to a particular \nsubsection of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act with reference to a provision under the \nCriminal Code of Canada. The Federal Court found that the amendment to the A44(1) report did \nnot need to be submitted to the MD for a fresh determination on a referral to the ID, so long as \nthe amendment conformed generally to the description of the alleged illegal conduct in the \noriginal report and identified an offence that was punishable by a maximum of at least ten years \nimprisonment. Relying on Uppal v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC \n338, the Federal Court found that the question was whether the amendment was so significant \nthat it required a fresh consideration by the MD, and held that the ID had reasonably relied on \nthe amended report because there was no substantive change in the description of the offence \non which it was based. Moreover, the person concerned and his counsel were made aware of \nthe amendment to the report at the outset of the hearing. \n \nOn the other hand, it is important for officers to note that an A44(1) report cannot be amended \nat any point where further review reveals that the report contains a substantive error (e.g., \nwrong inadmissibility section under the IRPA). In addition, where further investigation leads to a \nfinding that the grounds cited in the report are not valid but the person falls within some other \ninadmissible class, or identifies an additional ground of inadmissibility which the officer intends \nto pursue, the officer must write a new A44(1) report for a fresh referral to the MD. In such \ncases, where a new A44(1) report is written to replace an existing report, officers must ensure \nthe previous examination case is cancelled in GCMS in accordance with required procedures, \nincluding the creation of any process notes where appropriate. Where substantive changes are \nmade to the A44(1) report, officers must also ensure that the new report is provided to the \nperson concerned in accordance with the procedural fairness requirements outlined in previous \nsections of these guidelines. \n \n14.5 Overview: Minister's opinions/interventions \n \nIdentification of cases where an opinion under A115(2) of the Minister of IRCC for \nprotected persons may be warranted  \n  \nInformation may come to the attention of an officer in the course of an investigation of a person \nwho is a protected person under A95(2) which the officer believes may warrant flagging the \ncase for a future request for a Minister’s opinion under A115(2) that a person is a danger to the \npublic in Canada, or should not be allowed to remain in Canada on the basis of the nature and \nseverity of acts committed or of danger to the security of Canada.   \n \nWhile such a request may not be made until the person has been found to be inadmissible \nunder A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1) or A37 and becomes the subject of a removal order that is in \nforce, officers at the A44(1) stage may flag the case for consideration for a future request for a \nMinister’s opinion in their recommendation to the MD, where appropriate. If a removal order is \nissued, the case can then be referred for consideration of a request for a Minister’s opinion in \naccordance with agency guidelines and local processes.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n54 \n \n \n \nFor further information, see ENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and \nseverity of the acts committed and danger to the security of Canada. \n \nIntervention, cessation and vacation \n \nDuring the course of an A44(1) investigation, officers may have occasion to deal with \ninformation that may support a possible intervention in an outstanding claim for refugee \nprotection, or a cessation or vacation application for a protected person or Convention refugee.  \n \nIf such is the case, the information should be brought to the attention of the appropriate \nHearings unit where the information and/or evidence can be reviewed with respect to a potential \napplication to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board \n(IRB). \n \nIn some cases, an officer may receive information about a refugee claimant that could affect the \ndecision of the RPD. If an officer becomes aware of new information relative to any of the \ninadmissibility provisions under A34 through A37, or where there is information to suggest that \nthere is a substantive contradiction of any document or statement made by a refugee claimant, \nofficers should: \n \n \nconduct an interview and take notes (see section 11. 6,  ‘Procedure:  End of \nexamination for refugee claimants’;   \n \nseize any relevant documents under A140(1) that could be used as evidence; \n \nupdate the National Case Management System (NCMS) to indicate that the case is \nunder investigation and the reason(s) for the investigation; \n \ncontact the appropriate Hearings unit to discuss case details; \n \nat the request of the Hearings Officer or Hearings Advisor, conduct a further \ninvestigation to collect additional evidence; \n \nwhen the investigation is complete, transfer the file and all supporting documentation \nto the Hearings Officer or Hearings Advisor with a memorandum outlining the case \ndetails. \n \nNote: following a decision of the RPD that refugee protection has ceased under A108(2), the \nMinister may not simply rely on a previous removal order (issued against the person before \nprotected person status was granted) to remove that person. In other words, a new A44(1) \nreport based on inadmissibility under A40.1(1) would need to be written and a new removal \norder would need to be issued by the MD in these circumstances. \nFor further information, see ENF 24 Ministerial interventions. \n \n14.6 Imposition of conditions following the A44(1) report   \n \nA44(3) authorizes officers to impose any conditions, including the posting of a deposit or the \nposting of a guarantee for compliance with conditions, that the officer considers necessary, on a \npermanent resident or foreign national who is the subject of an A44(1) report, an admissibility \nhearing or, being in Canada, a removal order.   \n \nAt the port of entry, this includes circumstances where the officer does not authorize entry to a \nforeign national and prepares an A44(1) report.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n55 \n \n \n \nFor further information on deposits and guarantees, see ENF 8 Deposits and guarantees. \n \nMandatory Circumstances (POE cases) \n \nThere are also mandatory conditions which must be imposed at the port of entry pursuant \nR43(1) where the Border Services Officer adjourns an examination under A23: \n \n1. to report in person at the time and place specified for the completion of the      \n    examination or the admissibility hearing; \n2. to not engage in any work in Canada; \n3. to not attend any educational institution; and \n4. to report in person to an officer at a POE, if the person withdraws their application to       \n    enter Canada. \n \nNote:   A person whose examination has been deferred and who fails to report as required for \ncontinuation of their examination is reportable for non-compliance under A41(a). \n \nFor further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations and ENF 6 Review of reports \nunder A44(2). \n  \nMandatory Circumstances (Prescribed Conditions for A34 inadmissibility) \n \nIt is important for officers to note that under A44(4), the imposition of baseline conditions is \nmandatory by designated CBSA officials in cases of inadmissibility on security grounds under \nA34. For each of the circumstances outlined below, the prescribed conditions to be imposed are \nfound in R250.1. \n \nCBSA officers should be aware that the prescribed conditions must be imposed by the \ndesignated CBSA authority in the following circumstances: \n \n \nwhen an inadmissibility report on grounds of security (A34) is referred to the ID and \nthe subject of the report is not detained; \n \nwhen the subject of either an inadmissibility report on grounds of security (A34) that \nhas been referred to the ID or a removal order for inadmissibility on grounds of \nsecurity is released from detention. \n \nNote:  If the person is already subject to conditions imposed by the ID, an officer has no \nauthority to vary or supersede an order previously issued by the ID. Generally speaking, the ID \nretains jurisdiction with respect to the variation of previous terms and conditions imposed by the \nID.  In circumstances where an officer believes that previously imposed conditions by the ID are \nno longer required or are insufficient to ensure compliance, but may not necessarily require that \nthe person be re-arrested first, officers will refer the file to the appropriate Hearings unit, \narticulating the need to amend the existing conditions and request that a Hearings Officer make \na request to the ID to vary the order.\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n56 \n \n \nAppendix List \n \nAppendix A:  Sample call-in letter for interview: Refugee claimant \n \nAppendix B:  Sample letter to be sent where no interview is requested- Person no longer subject \nto examination (includes permanent resident and protected person) \n \nAppendix C:  Sample Questionnaire to accompany Appendix B letter to provide submissions \n \nAppendix D:  Sample Call-in letter for interview – Person no longer subject to examination \n(includes permanent resident and protected person) \n \nAppendix E:  Sample A44(1) Narrative report   \n \nAppendix F:  Table:  Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) Inadmissible Classes\nENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n57 \n \n \nAppendix A:  Sample call-in letter for interview: Refugee claimant \n \n(Name and Address of person concerned)  \n \n \nRef:  UCI/File #: \n \n(Date)   \n \nDear XXXX (given name and surname of person concerned) ; \nA report under subsection 44(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act may be \nprepared alleging that you are inadmissible to Canada under the Immigration and Refugee \nProtection Act.

The next step in the process is to conduct a review of the \ncircumstances surrounding your alleged inadmissibility.   \n You may provide relevant evidence or submissions that you wish to be considered in relation to \nthis matter of your admissibility to Canada.

A decision on whether you are inadmissible to Canada or not and whether the officer will \nseek to have a removal order issued against you will be made in the near future. The next step in the \nprocess is to conduct a complete review of the circumstances surrounding your alleged inadmissibility. \nIn order to fully assess the circumstances of your case and provide you with an opportunity to respond \nto any concerns the Minister may have, you are requested to attend an interview on: \n(Insert Date and time) at (CBSA office address) \nThe purpose of the interview will be to discuss your alleged inadmissibility to Canada and to provide you \nwith an opportunity to respond to any concerns the officer may have.
