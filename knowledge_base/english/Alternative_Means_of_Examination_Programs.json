Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n2 \n \n1. \nWhat this chapter is about  \nThis chapter provides functional direction and guidance to Canada Border Services Agency \n(CBSA) officers, managers and others with regard to the alternative means of examination (AME) \nprograms.  These programs were previously referred to as alternate inspection systems (AIS). \n2. \nProgram objectives  \nAdvanced screening programs and procedures are tools that enhance the orderly flow of low-risk \ntravellers seeking entry into Canada and the United States depending on the AME program.  Pre-\nscreening programs such as CANPASS, NEXUS, Free and Secure Trade (FAST) and \nCommercial Driver Registration Program (CDRP) are available to pre-approved citizens and \npermanent residents of Canada or the U.S. Such programs are designed to expedite the entry of \nauthorized persons without having to proceed through the traditional customs and immigration \nexamination process. \nNEXUS programs and FAST stem from the Canada-United States of America Accord on Our \nShared Border (SBA) and are some of the initiatives of the Smart Border Declaration's (SBD) 32-\nPoint Plan.  More information about the SBD can be found at the following link:   \nhttp://www.dfait.gc.ca/can-am/menu-en.asp?mid=1&cat=10 \nThe CANPASS programs are initiatives under the Customs Action Plan (CAP) that are based on \na risk-assessment system that allow customs and immigration to streamline the processing of \nlow-risk travellers and focus resources on higher or unknown risks. More information about the \nCAP can be found at the following link: \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/blue_print/menu-e.html \n3. \nThe Act and Regulations  \n \nFor more information about:  \nRefer to: \nNotes: \nAlternative means of examination  \nR38(a), R38(b), R38(g), R38(h) \nPreviously referred to as alternate \ninspection systems (AIS) \nAuthorization to present himself or \nherself in an alternative manner \nSubsection 11.1(1) of the \nCustoms Act \n \nExamination by officer where \nperson makes an application \nA15(1), R28(a) \n \nReport on inadmissibility \nA44(1) \n \nResidency obligation \nA28 \n \nExamination by officer \nA18(1) \n \nSeizure \nA140(1) \nAuthority to seize or hold an  AME \nmembership card or document \nWhere an application is made in \nwriting \nR28(a) \nFor the purpose of A15(1)\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n3 \nA18(1) states:  \n18(1) Every person seeking to enter Canada must appear for an examination to \ndetermine whether that person has a right to enter Canada or is or may become \nauthorized to enter and remain in Canada.   \nThis requirement is satisfied once the person has been risk assessed by officers of the CBSA \nImmigration Processing Centre (CBSA IPC) and/or the Enrolment Centre (EC).  A15(1) \nauthorizes an officer to proceed with an examination where a person makes an application to the \nofficer.   \nR28(a) stipulates that a person makes an application in accordance with the Act by submitting an \napplication in writing. R38 provides the legislative authority for an officer to allow a person to be \nexamined by the means indicated as alternative to appearing for an examination by an officer at a \nport of entry (POE) unless otherwise directed.   \nThe CBSA customs officers are responsible for rendering decisions on the eligibility of all \napplicants to AME programs. Specifically, subsection 11.1(1) of the Customs Act states that any \nperson may be issued an authorization to present himself or herself in an alternative manner. \nCBSA immigration officers are responsible for determining the admissibility of persons applying \nfor AME programs who are foreign nationals and permanent residents of Canada. Sections A34 \nto A42 set the grounds that could make such persons inadmissible to Canada. \n3.1. \nForms required \nTitle \nNumber \nNotice of Seizure \nIMM 5265 \n4. \nInstruments and delegations \nThe CBSA’s immigration officers’ role is to ensure that persons applying to participate in an AME \nprogram meet the requirements of the program as they pertain to admissibility to Canada. Such \nprograms are contemplated by A18(1) and R38. The full authority to conduct examinations of \npersons seeking to enter Canada, including those conducted pursuant to section R38, is given to \na range of officials, including POE officers.  \nFor more information on the Delegation of Authority and Designation of Officers document,  see \nchapter IL 3 at \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/il/il3/index_e.asp \n5. \nDepartmental policy \nR38 stipulates that for the purposes of A18(1), a person may be examined by the means \nindicated as alternative to appearing for an examination by an officer at a POE when they have \npreviously been examined and hold an  authorization issued under subsection 11.1(1) of the \nCustoms Act.   \nThe Presentation of Persons (2003) Regulations under the Customs Act prescribe the classes of \npersons who may be authorized to present themselves in an alternative manner and the \nrequirements and conditions that are to be met before an authorization may be issued. \n6. \nDefinitions  \nAcronym/Initialism \nDefinition \nAIS \nAlternate Inspection Systems\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n4 \nAME \nAlternative Means of Examination \nCAP \nCustoms Action Plan \nCBSA \nCanada Border Services Agency \nCBSA PC \nCanada Border Services Agency Processing \nCentre (previously referred to as  Customs \nProcessing Centre-CPC) \nCBSA IPC \nCanada Border Services Agency Immigration \nProcessing Centre (previously referred to as \nImmigration Processing Centre-IPC) \nCDRP \nCommercial Driver Registration Program \nCPIC \nCanadian Police Information Centre \nFAST \nFree and Secure Trade \nEC \nEnrolment Centre \nGEC \nGlobal Enrolment Component \nICS \nIntegrated Customs System  \nICES \nIntegrated Customs Enforcement System  \nIPBM \nImmigration Ports and Border Management \nDirectorate, Border and Compliance Programs \nDirectorate, Admissibility Branch (CBSA) \n \nIPIL \nIntegrated Primary Inspection Line   \nNCB \nA FOSS Non-Computer-Based Entry  \nNCIC \nNational Crime Information Center (U.S.) \nPIL \nPrimary Inspection Line \nPIRS \nPolice Information Retrieval System \nPOE  \nPort of Entry \nRABC \nRemote Area Border Crossing—CANPASS \nSBA \nShared Border Accord \nSBD \nShared Border Declaration \nU.S. CBP \nUnited States Customs and Border Protection  \n6.1. \nOverview of programs \n \nCANPASS Private Aircraft \nThe CANPASS Private Aircraft program makes clearing customs and immigration easier for low-\nrisk private aircraft owners and their passengers travelling to Canada from the U.S. Persons who \nfly directly from the U.S. to Canada and land at small airports benefit from this initiative. The \nprogram is open to citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada.  \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/canpass/privateair-e.html \n \nCANPASS Corporate Aircraft \nThe CANPASS Corporate Aircraft program makes clearing customs and immigration easier for \nbusiness travellers, who are citizens or permanent residents of the U.S or Canada, flying to \nCanada from the U.S. on a corporate aircraft. The program is geared towards companies that \nown or operate a corporate aircraft that fly frequently to Canada directly from the U.S. This \nprogram allows access to more airports and provides expedited clearances for low-risk, pre-\nscreened travellers. The corporation can register employees and other individuals who are \nintegral to its business operations. CANPASS corporate flights can land at any airport of entry or \nCANPASS-only airports in Canada at any time during the facility’s hours of operation.  \nFor more information, see\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n5 \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/canpass/corporateair-e.html \n \nCANPASS Private Boats  \nThe CANPASS Private Boats program streamlines the customs and immigration clearance of \nlow-risk boaters. The program combines a telephone reporting system with a pre-approval permit \nfor recreational boaters.The CANPASS Private Boats permit allows boaters, who have enrolled \nand been security cleared, the option of calling before they arrive in order to receive clearance to \nenter Canada. Travellers may declare goods by telephone and pay any applicable duties and \ntaxes by credit card. For cash payments, travellers must report to the nearest CBSA cashier. The \nprogram is open to citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/canpass/canpassprivateboat-e.html \n \nCANPASS Air  \nThe CANPASS Air program is an initiative of the CBSA which facilitates efficient and secure entry \ninto Canada for pre-approved, low-risk air travellers at major international Canadian airports. The \nprogram is open to citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada who have \ncontinuously resided in Canada or the U.S., or a combination of both countries, for the last three \nconsecutive years. CANPASS Air allows pre-approved travellers to clear customs and \nimmigration by simply looking into a camera that recognizes the iris of their eye as proof of \nidentity. The program permits enforcement activities to be targeted elsewhere. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/canpass/canpassair-e.html \n \nCANPASS Remote Area Border Crossing \nThe CANPASS Remote Area Border Crossing (RABC) permit is an initiative that allows the \nbearer of a permit to cross the border into Canada at certain remote areas without reporting to a \nPOE, as long as imported goods are declared. Citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or \nCanada may apply for this permit. \nThe permit is valid for the following locations: \n• \nfrom Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  \n• \nthe Canadian shore of Lake Superior; and \n• \nCockburn Island  \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/rabc.html \n \nCommercial Driver Registration Program (CDRP) \nIn order to transport goods under the Customs Self Assessment (CSA) option, commercial \ncarriers and drivers must be registered and able to demonstrate a high level of compliance with \nthe laws and regulations administered by the CBSA. CDRP involves a rigorous pre-screening and \napproval process for participants’ registration. \nCitizens and permanent residents of Canada or the U.S. may apply to register with the CDRP. \nProspective CDRP participants are required to provide proof of citizenship or legal permanent \nresidence, a copy of their driver's licence and other detailed personal information. A thorough \nscreening process is conducted using customs, immigration and police databases to determine if \nthe eligibility criteria are met.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n6 \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/import/programs-e.html \n \nFree and Secure Trade (FAST)  \nThe CBSA and the Department of Homeland Security’s United States Customs and Border \nProtection (U.S. CBP) are working together to end threats to public security and safety, while \nkeeping the border open to the free flow of low-risk, legitimate trade. For that reason, Canada and \nthe U.S. have agreed to align, to the maximum extent possible, the customs commercial \nprograms along the border. This agreement marks the creation of FAST, which is the result of a \nshared objective to enhance safety and security while enhancing the economic prosperity of both \ncountries. The program is open to citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/import/fast/menu-e.html \n \nNEXUS Highway  \nNEXUS Highway was implemented jointly by the CBSA and U.S. CBP. This program is designed \nto simplify and expedite land border crossings for pre-approved, low-risk travellers. The program \nis open to citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada who have continuously resided \nin Canada or the U.S, or a combination of these two countries, for the last three consecutive \nyears.  \nNEXUS is harmonized and bi-national, which means that participants will complete only one \nmembership application allowing entry to both Canada and the U.S.   \nMembers of the NEXUS Highway program can: \n• \nuse dedicated NEXUS lanes in Canada and the U.S. (where available);  \n• \nbenefit from simplified and expedited border crossing and entry into Canada and the U.S. as \nthey are not subject to traditional customs and immigration questioning.  \nNEXUS members may be subject to an examination at any time. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/nexus/menu-e.html \n \nNEXUS Air \nIn 2002, Canada and the U.S. announced the creation of a bi-national working group to design \nand implement a NEXUS Air Pilot Project for air travellers. The project was implemented in \nNovember 2004 and is available at the Vancouver International Airport for the duration of the pilot. \nThe CBSA and U.S. CBP have designed NEXUS Air to facilitate passage into Canada and the \nU.S. for pre-approved, low-risk, frequent air travellers. The pilot project uses automated kiosks \nwith iris-recognition biometric technology and is open to citizens and permanent residents of the \nU.S. or Canada who have continuously resided in Canada or the U.S., or a combination of both \ncountries, for the last three consecutive years. Members of NEXUS Air will enter Canada or the \nU.S. without further interaction with customs or immigration officials, unless selected randomly for \ninspection. NEXUS Air is a bi-national initiative that builds upon the technological innovations of \nCANPASS Air. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/nexus/menu-e.html\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n7 \n \nNEXUS Marine \nThe NEXUS Marine Detroit River Pilot Project serves those persons who often travel between \nCanada and the U.S. using private pleasure boats and is implemented in the Windsor/ Detroit \narea only. The project allows boaters, who have enrolled and been security cleared, the option of \ncalling before they arrive in order to receive clearance to enter Canada and the U.S. Since \nNEXUS Marine is being offered as an extension to the NEXUS Highway program, applicants \nneed only complete one application to be considered for both programs. The pilot project is open \nto citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada who have continuously resided in \nCanada or the U.S., or a combination of both, for the last three consecutive years. \nNEXUS Marine Pilot Project will be in operation during the 2005 boating season. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/nexus/menu-e.html \n7. \nProcedures: CBSA Immigration Processing Centre  \n7.1. \nOverview \nThe CBSA Immigration Processing Centre forms an integral part of the risk assessment process. \nEvery person who applies to a national AME program must be approved by the CBSA Processing \nCentre (Customs) and the CBSA IPC (Immigration).  Persons who apply to a bi-national AME \nmust be approved by the CBSA and U.S. CBP. The CBSA IPCs provide security screening of \nAME applicants by completing detailed checks and reviews of various law enforcement \ndatabases. The three CBSA IPCs that operate in Canada are located in Douglas (British \nColumbia), Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Montréal (Québec).     \n7.2. \nRisk assessment \nWhile it is the CBSA immigration officer’s role to ensure that applicants who are foreign nationals \nor permanent residents are admissible to Canada, it is necessary for officers to understand the \ndifferent eligibility criteria of each program in order to make the proper recommendation to the \nCBSA PC. Officers working at the CBSA IPC are responsible for performing the following \nfunctions: \n• \nDetermine admissibility into Canada for non-Canadian citizen applicants;  \n• \nEvaluate and equate criminal offences for applicants or participants that are not Canadian \ncitizens; \n• \nReview any immigration violations associated with the applicant or participant as found in the \nFOSS records; \n• \nProvide the CBSA PC with recommendations based on program eligibility criteria when an \nimmigration violation has been associated to an application or other eligibility issues that \nhave come to the attention of the CBSA IPC. \nFor specific program requirements relating to immigration violations, please refer to the \nappropriate AME program located in Appendix A, entitled “Immigration Violations.” \n7.3. \nFOSS \nCBSA IPC officers will conduct a complete FOSS check of all applicants, including Canadian \ncitizens and permanent residents.  The purpose of conducting a FOSS check on all applicants is \nto assist in determining whether the applicant is admissible to Canada and/or to determine if they\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n8 \nhave ever had any immigration violations. This includes the review of all FOSS records in the \nform of reports, orders, lookouts and all non-computer-based entries. A complete FOSS check \nmust include a review of the remarks from the history of permanent residents in order to \ndetermine whether any previous criminal convictions or immigration violations exist.  \nIn certain circumstances CBSA IPC officers will find evidence that a permanent resident may not \nhave met their residency obligation pursuant to A28. In such circumstances, officers are advised \nto follow the procedures outlined in section 7.5 below entitled “Residency obligation.”   \n7.4. \nPermanent residents \nWhile permanent residents retain the right to enter Canada under the Act, their acceptance into \nan AME program may be affected by various factors including previous immigration legislation \nviolations or criminality. This is especially important for those programs that will not accept \napplicants who have been convicted of an offence or have been found in violation of immigration \nlaw. For example, NEXUS programs have a zero-tolerance policy. \n7.5. \nResidency obligation  \nAs a permanent resident is required under section A28 to reside in Canada for 730 days in a five-\nyear period, unless otherwise exempted under that section, it may become evident during the \nprocessing of their AME application that they have not met their residency obligation. Should an \nofficer of the CBSA IPC encounter such a situation, it will be necessary to conduct further \nexamination of the applicant’s residency history prior to approval of their AME application.  \nIn the interim, the CBSA IPC officer should contact the applicant by letter and keep the \napplicant’s file “pending” for a maximum of 90 days. See Appendix B entitled “Letter requesting \nadditional information to determine admissibility and residency” for the initial letter to be sent to \nthe applicant. An NCB should also be entered into FOSS at this time by the CBSA IPC officer \nindicating that a residency determination is required.  See Appendix C entitled “Standard format \nof NCB (non-computer-based entries) in FOSS” for more information on standard FOSS remarks. \nIf a response is not received from the applicant within 30 days, the CBSA IPC will change the \nstatus of the file from “pending” to a recommendation of “fail.”  The CBSA PC must be advised of \nthe information in order to render a final decision on the application. \nPlease refer to Appendix F entitled “FOSS results form” to view the worksheet used to \ncommunicate the information to the CBSA PC. Depending on the AME program, CBSA IPC \nresults may be entered electronically by using the Global Enrolment Component (GEC) system.   \nIf the applicant responds to the letter within 30 days, the CBSA IPC officer will request that the \napplicant provide proof of their residence in order to satisfy the residency requirement. This can \nbe done via the telephone and/or in writing by sending supporting documentation by fax. If the \nCBSA IPC officer is satisfied that the applicant has met the residency obligation under A28, the \nofficer will change the status of the file from “pending” to a recommendation of “pass.”  The CBSA \nPC will be advised accordingly. \nIf the CBSA IPC officer is not satisfied that the applicant has met the residency obligation and \nadditional information is not required to make this determination, the officer may change the \nstatus of the file from “pending” to a recommendation of “fail” .The CBSA PC must be advised of \nthe information in order to render a final decision on the application.  The NCB in FOSS must be \nupdated accordingly. \nIf the CBSA IPC officer is of the opinion that the residency obligation determination requires a \nmore in-depth examination, the officer will send the applicant a second letter; see Appendix D \nentitled “Residency obligation for permanent residents.” This subsequent letter advises the \napplicant to present themselves at the nearest inland office or Canadian Consulate/ Embassy \nabroad for an interview. In such cases, the file will remain in “pending” status until a residency \ndetermination is made.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n9 \nCBSA IPC officers may receive a request for a residency obligation determination from the \nEnrolment Centre. See Appendix E entitled “Request for Residency Determination Form” to view \nthis form. If such a request is made by the EC, it will be necessary for the CBSA IPC officer to \ncontact the applicant using the procedures outlined above. Officers of the CBSA IPC will be \nrequired to follow up with the EC to advise them of the outcome of the residency obligation \ndetermination request.   \nIf the applicant is a permanent resident of Canada, but holds citizenship or permanent resident \nstatus in the U.S., the CBSA IPC officer should “pass” the applicant (assuming that the applicant \nis not otherwise inadmissible to Canada). It is not necessary to place these files in “pending” \nstatus since the applicant remains eligible to apply to the program regardless of whether or not \nthey meet their residency obligation in Canada. An NCB “Watch-For” must be added in FOSS to \nensure that the applicant is referred for a secondary examination the first time they use the AME \nprogram. This will provide CBSA Immigration officers with the opportunity to complete a residency \ndetermination during the secondary examination and, if applicable, have the member voluntarily \nrelinquish their Canadian permanent resident status.   \nFor further information on loss of permanent resident status, see ENF 23 Loss of permanent \nresident status at: \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/enf/enf23/index_e.asp \n7.6. \nCriminality \nOfficers of the CBSA IPC are called upon to review the criminal history of all non-Canadian \napplicants. It is the responsibility of the CBSA IPC officers to determine if applicants are \nadmissible to Canada and to provide a recommendation regarding eligibility, on occasion, to the \nCBSA PC based on the applicable AME program’s criteria.   \nThe CBSA PC conducts the initial screening of applicants and subsequently provides the CBSA \nIPC officers with a printout or flags their names for further investigation. These cases can also be \nassigned electronically to the CBSA IPC officers through the Global Enrolment Component (GEC) \ndepending on the program. If information is missing, incomplete or when otherwise required, \nofficers of the CBSA IPC will conduct further database checks. \nAn application is referred or assigned for criminality by the CBSA PC in the following \ncircumstances: \n• \nApplicant may have a “hit” for CPIC wants, warrants and/or criminal history; \n• \nApplicant may have a “hit” for NCIC wants, warrants and/or criminal history;  \n• \nApplicant self-disclosed a criminal conviction on the application form for which they have not \nreceived a Canadian pardon. \nCBSA IPC officers will review the applicant’s information and compare this to the criminal history \n“hit” in order to ascertain if the person is admissible to Canada. Chapters ENF 1 and ENF 2 offer \nguidance on the inadmissibility of clients. These chapters are available at: \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/enf/enf1/index_e.asp \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/enf/enf2/index_e.asp \nIf a CBSA IPC officer is required to obtain further information pertaining to an applicant’s criminal \nhistory, they may contact the applicant by phone or letter in order to determine their admissibility.  \nThis letter can be found in Appendix B entitled “Letter requesting additional information to \ndetermine admissibility and residency.” The officer must ensure that privacy legislation is adhered \nto as it relates to third-party information.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n10 \n7.7. \nPending applications \nIf an admissibility determination cannot be made due to a lack of information, the CBSA IPC \nofficers will temporarily place their file in “pending” status and contact the applicant. The preferred \nmethod will be by letter requesting the applicant to contact the CBSA IPC to provide further \ninformation. This will mitigate any question of identity involving an applicant whose application is \nwith the CBSA IPC for risk assessment. The applicant are advised that they have 30 days from \nthe date of the letter to respond to the request. This letter is found at Appendix B entitled “Letter \nrequesting additional information to determine admissibility and residency.” \n7.8. \nCorrespondence to applicants \nThe CBSA IPC officers may correspond with applicants for matters arising out of information \nlocated within immigration-related databases. CBSA IPC officers may also communicate with \napplicants in regards to criminal history found in the FOSS, CPIC, and NCIC databases. The \napplicant will be requested in the letter to contact the CBSA IPC by telephone within 30 days of \nthe date on the letter. This letter is found at Appendix B entitled “Letter requesting additional \ninformation to determine admissibility and residency.” The officer must ensure that privacy \nlegislation is adhered to in relation to third party information.  \n7.9. \nCorrespondence from applicants \nIf the applicant responds to a request for further information within 30 days of the date of the letter \nand the CBSA IPC officer considers the person inadmissible to Canada, the officer will forward a \nrecommendation of “fail” to the CBSA PC. If an applicant responds within 30 days and a request \nis made for further information, i.e., a police record check, the applicant will be given an additional \n60 days to comply. Any further extensions will be at the discretion of the CBSA IPC officer. If the \napplicant does not respond within the 30-day time limit, the CBSA IPC officer will forward a \nrecommendation of “fail” to the CBSA PC. \nIf the applicant provides sufficient proof, through satisfactory documentation, that they are not \ninadmissible to Canada, a recommendation of “pass” will be made to the CBSA PC.   \nIf information exists that an applicant is ineligible for the program but remains admissible to \nCanada, the CBSA PC must be advised of the information in order to render a final decision.  \nNote: The applicant is still considered admissible to Canada, but a recommendation of “fail” will be \nprovided to the CBSA PC in terms of eligibility to the program.  \nSee Appendix F entitled “FOSS Results Form” to view the worksheet used to communicate the \ninformation to the CBSA PC. Depending on the AME program, the CBSA IPC results may be \nentered electronically by using the Global Enrolment Component system.  \n7.10. \nCanadian citizens \nIt is important to note the following information pertaining to Canadian citizens. \nWhile Canadian citizens retain the right to enter and remain in Canada under the Act, their \nacceptance into an AME program may be affected by various factors including previous \nimmigration legislation violations or criminality. An applicant who is a Canadian citizen may be \nineligible to participate in certain AME programs as the result of previous immigration violations. \nPlease refer to Appendix A  entitled “Immigration violations.” \nIf a criminal or immigration violation history is found in FOSS, it will be the CBSA IPC officer’s \nresponsibility to make a recommendation to the CBSA PC as to the applicant’s eligibility to join \nthe program based on that program’s criteria. See Appendix F entitled “FOSS Results Form” to \nview the worksheet used to communicate the information to the CBSA PC. Depending on the \nAME program, CBSA IPC results may be entered electronically by using the Global Enrolment \nComponent system.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n11 \nCBSA IPC officers may not review the criminal history of a Canadian citizen unless that history is \nfound in FOSS. \n7.11. \nImmigration violations \nOnce admissibility to Canada has been determined, CBSA IPC officers will further review the \nFOSS database for documented immigration violations. The CBSA IPC officer can refer to \nAppendix A entitled “Immigration violations” as a guide to recommend “fail” or “pass” to the CBSA \nPC based on the program criteria. Please note that admissibility to Canada supersedes all other \nprogram eligibility criteria.   \nTo view the worksheet used to communicate the information to the CBSA PC, refer to Appendix F \nentitled “FOSS Results Form.”  Depending on the AME program, CBSA IPC results may be \nentered electronically by using the Global Enrolment system.   \n7.12. \nApproved applications \nIf there are no concerns regarding admissibility or eligibility (i.e., no criminality or immigration \nviolations) during the risk-assessment phase of the process, officers at the CBSA IPC will provide \na recommendation of “pass” to the CBSA PC. See Appendix F entitled “FOSS Results Form” to \nview the worksheet used to communicate the information to the CBSA PC. Depending on the \nAME program, CBSA IPC results may be entered electronically by using the Global Enrolment \nComponent system.   \n7.13. \nSelf-disclosure (Risk assessment phase) \nPursuant to A11 for foreign nationals and A21 for permanent residents, an applicant must satisfy \nan officer that they are not inadmissible to Canada and that they meet all other requirements \nprovided in the aforementioned sections of the Act. Situations may occur where an applicant \ndiscloses previous violations or other inadmissibility grounds on their application form, in \nresponse to a letter or over the phone during the risk assessment phase.  \nOfficers may obtain information from an applicant that does not affect admissibility although the \ndisclosure will affect their eligibility into the AME program. In these situations, a recommendation \nof “fail” in terms of the believed ineligibility should be forwarded to the CBSA PC.  See Appendix \nF entitled “FOSS Results Form” to view the worksheet used to communicate the information to \nthe CBSA PC. Depending on the AME program, the CBSA IPC results may be entered \nelectronically by using the Global Enrolment Component system.   \nSee “Self-disclosure by applicant at interview (Enrolment phase)” in section 8.2 below.. \n7.14. \nDenied applications \nIf upon review of the security-screening information, an officer determines that an applicant is \ninadmissible to Canada, the CBSA IPC officer will forward a recommendation of “fail” to the \nCBSA PC for the final determination of eligibility to the AME program. Officers may encounter \nsituations in which the applicant is admissible to Canada but has previously been in violation of \nimmigration law or has been convicted of an offence that does not affect their admissibility. In \nsuch circumstances, the applicant may still be ineligible for the AME program for which they have \napplied. Please refer to Appendix F entitled “FOSS Results Form” to view the worksheet used to \ncommunicate the information to the CBSA PC. Depending on the AME program, the CBSA PC \nresults may be entered electronically by using the Global Enrolment Component system.   \nIt is the CBSA IPC officer’s responsibility to ensure that an NCB (General) is entered into FOSS \nreflecting the recommendation to the CBSA PC that an applicant be refused into the program.  \nThis will ensure that border officials are aware of the circumstances involving the denial of an \napplicant into any AME program. Refer to section 7.16 entitled “Non-computer-based entries \n(NCB) in FOSS”  below for more detail.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n12 \nClients may seek redress by requesting a review from the CBSA Customs where applications \nhave been refused. \n7.15. \nRehabilitation counselling \nAny applicant who is denied membership into an AME program (except for NEXUS programs) as \na result of criminality should be counselled to seek rehabilitation, if eligible, from a Canadian \nConsulate abroad or upon entry into Canada at a POE. However, applicants applying to the \nFAST and/or CDRP programs may apply to the designated rehabilitation centre that has been \nestablished for that purpose in Niagara Falls.   \nThe contact information for the Criminal Rehabilitation Processing Centre has been provided in \nAppendix G for your convenience. \nFor more information on criminal rehabilitation, consult the chapter ENF 14: \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/index_e.asp \n7.16. \nNon-computer-based entries (NCB) in FOSS \nThe use of an NCB is particularly important when an applicant has been refused membership into \nan AME program for inadmissibility. Should the CBSA IPC officer’s determination be based on \ninformation provided by law enforcement databases or any other source including self- \ndisclosure, it is imperative that an NCB be placed in FOSS. An NCB should also be placed in \nFOSS for those persons who are potentially inadmissible based on the above-noted sources of \ninformation and if they have not responded to a request by the CBSA IPC for further information.   \nAn enforcement NCB should only be used in the case of inadmissibility or other urgent requests \nto intercept a person seeking entry. It is recommended that a “General Information” NCB be used \nin all other cases.  \nPlease refer to Appendix C entitled “Standard format of NCB (non-computer-based entries) in \nFOSS” for more information on standard FOSS remarks. \n7.17. \nAdditional risk assessment at the CBSA IPC \nWhen an applicant discloses information at the EC interview that is not on the original application, \nor an error is discovered on the application (i.e., incorrect date of birth, name spelled incorrectly, \nmaiden name not listed, etc.), the interviewing officer will suspend the process. The EC officer \nmust forward the new and/or corrected information to the CBSA PC where the information will \nverified a second time against the databases. Once the CBSA PC officer completes the security \nchecks, the new and/or corrected information will be referred to the CBSA IPC for reassessment.  \nSee Appendix H entitled “AME Security Review Form” for more information. \n7.18. \nYearly review \nYearly risk assessments will be conducted for members of all AME programs to ensure that they \ncontinue to be admissible to Canada and eligible to participate in the programs. The CBSA PC \nwill refer the membership information to the CBSA IPC for FOSS checks and if applicable, for \nCPIC/NCIC reviews. If information is discovered during the yearly risk assessment that may affect \nadmissibility and/or eligibility, the officers will advise the CBSA PC of their findings and make the \nappropriate recommendation.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n13 \n8. \nProcedures: Enrolment phase  \n8.1. \nOverview \nECs are unique in that they offer a chance for officers of the CBSA and U.S. CBP, as applicable, \nto work in shared offices. The location of ECs varies depending on the program, though they are \ngenerally located at or in close proximity to POEs at both land borders and airports.   \nAt the enrolment phase, the applicant will be required to have a digital photo of their face taken \nfor their membership card. This image will be stored in secure government databases.  \nDepending on the program, the applicant will be required to submit fingerprints which will be used \nto assess risk. Finally, the applicant will be provided with training on the relevant technology and \nprogram terms and conditions.   \n8.2. \nInterview process \nApplicants who have met the screening criteria established by the pertinent agencies will be \ncontacted regarding the next stage of the process. This phase of the process requires applicants, \nif applicable, to present themselves at the EC where they will be interviewed by an officer of the \nCBSA and/or U.S. CBP depending on the specific AME program.  \nNote: Face-to-face interviews are not required for all AME programs.   \n \nInterview scheduling \nEach program’s local working groups determine how interviews are best scheduled, based on a \nnumber of factors including client volumes, availability of resources, number of computer \nterminals, and the maximum number of clients the EC is able to accommodate at once. Walk-ins \nas well as scheduled interviews should be considered. The designation of Canada and/or U.S. \ndays may also be contemplated in order to clear a backlog. \n \nInterviewing applicants and guidelines \nWhen interviewing an applicant at the EC, it is important for officers to be aware that, prior to the \napplicant’s arrival, a thorough screening process has been conducted, including verification of \nFOSS, CPIC, PIRS, ICES, NCIC and other U.S. databases (depending on the AME program),  .  \nCBSA EC immigration officers will not be able to verify databases at the EC. Applicants will be \ninterviewed by officials of the CBSA and U.S. CBP depending on the program. Typically, CBSA \nEC immigration officers will interview applicants who are not Canadian citizens (i.e., U.S. citizens \nand resident aliens and Canadian permanent residents). CBSA EC immigration officers will verify, \nthrough questioning and the review of information, the applicant’s identity, citizenship, permanent \nresident status, residency, purpose of travel to Canada, intentions while in Canada, personal \nhistory including employment ties to Canada if any, health, and criminality.   \nThe interview provides the appropriate agencies with an opportunity to review with the applicant \nall the information provided up to this stage and to make a final determination on their: \n• \nadmissibility to both countries as appropriate; \n• \neligibility for the individual program for which an application has been submitted. \nFor further information on examination procedures, see ENF 4 at \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/enf/enf4/index_e.asp\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n14 \n \nSelf-disclosure by applicant at interview (enrolment phase) \nSituations may occur where the security risk assessment of an applicant does not yield the \nexistence of any violation, criminal conviction or other criminal offence, but during the interview, \nthe applicant voluntarily discloses a previous violation, criminal conviction or criminal offence. \nWhere the existence of the violation, conviction or other criminal offence would affect the \napplicant’s eligibility, based on the eligibility criteria for the program, an additional security risk \nassessment will be performed searching for a documented record of the violation, conviction or \nother criminal offence.  \nSee Appendix H entitled “AME Security Review Form” to communicate the information to the \nCBSA PC. \n \nPermanent resident determinations \nDuring the enrolment interview, it may come to the attention of the EC CBSA immigration officer \nthat a permanent resident of Canada may not meet the residency obligation pursuant to A28.  In \nthese cases, since the EC officer is not in the position to perform such a lengthy interview, the \nofficer will follow the guidelines below. \nThe officer will explain to the applicant that membership in the program cannot be completed until \ntheir Canadian permanent residency obligation status has been determined by an immigration \nofficer.   \nThe CBSA immigration officer will complete the Request for Residency Determination form and \nfax it to the appropriate CBSA IPC which processed their application.  See Appendix E entitled \n“Request for Residency Determination Form.”  \nThe status of the applicant’s membership should remain in \"pending\" status until the CBSA IPC \nadvises the EC to proceed with the interview or to change the status to \"fail.\" To ensure an \nappropriate follow-up, the EC officer will advise the applicant that a letter will be mailed to them \nby the CBSA IPC. See section 7.5  entitled “Residency obligation” for more information on the \nCBSA IPC’s role and responsibilities in residency obligation determinations.    \nThe EC CBSA immigration officer will counsel the applicant on the type of information that they \nwill need to send to the IPC and/or for their status determination interview.  \n8.3. \nAdditional risk assessment at the EC \nEvery applicant is required to provide true and complete information on their application including \nany conviction for which they have not received a pardon. It is important to note that the eligibility \ncriteria for AME programs stipulate that membership will not be granted to those who have a \ncriminal conviction where no pardon has been granted or where the person has not been deemed \nrehabilitated pursuant to the Act. Persons applying to AME programs, with the exception of \nNEXUS programs, may be granted membership if they have been deemed rehabilitated by a \nCIC/CBSA immigration officer.  \nAdditional risk assessments should not be performed by the EC officers as all criminal records \nand customs and immigration background checks have already been completed by the \nprocessing centres. In the event that new information is obtained on an applicant that was not \npreviously disclosed or was not discovered by the processing centres, the following procedure \nmust be followed for CBSA EC immigration officers: \nThe CBSA EC immigration officer must contact the CBSA PC and notify the U.S. CBP at the EC \nthat an additional risk assessment is required.  The officer will then contact the CBSA IPC by fax \nadvising them of the disclosure or discovery of additional information. Please refer to Appendix H \nentitled “AME Security Review Form.”\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n15 \nThe officer will advise the applicant that they must conduct further checks before final approval \ninto the AME program may be granted and that the CBSA PC will contact them in writing with \ntheir decision. \n8.4. \nBiometrics \nIndividuals wishing to join certain AME programs are required to submit biometric information for \nthe purpose of security screening during enrolment and/or to confirm identity at passage. Please \nconsult the table below for the biometrics requirements of each program. \n \n• \nPROGRAM: \n• \nBIOMETRICS: \n• \nNEXUS HIGHWAY \n• \nTWO INDEX FINGERPRINTS/ PHOTO / \nDISCRETIONARY FULL SET OF \nFINGERPRINTS \n• \nNEXUS AIR \n• \nIRIS/ PHOTO/ TWO INDEX FINGERPRINTS/ \nDISCRETIONARY FULL SET OF \nFINGERPRINTS \n• \nNEXUS MARINE \n• \nTWO INDEX FINGERPRINTS/ PHOTO / \nDISCRETIONARY FULL SET OF \nFINGERPRINTS \n• \nFAST \n• \nTWO INDEX FINGERPRINTS/ MANDATORY \nFULL SET OF FINGERPRINTS/ PHOTO  \n• \nCDRP \n• \nPHOTO  \n• \nCANPASS AIR \n• \nIRIS / PHOTO/ DISCRETIONARY FULL SET \nOF FINGERPRINTS \n• \nCANPASS RABC \n• \nNONE \n• \nCANPASS: PRIVATE AIR, CORPORATE AIR, \nPRIVATE BOAT \n• \nNONE \n8.5. \nMembership counselling \nOnce approved, members should receive information and clarification of any questions they may \nhave about the relevant program. These instructions may involve a demonstration of the \nappropriate technology of the program, including the use of the kiosk or a proximity card.  \nAll new participants to any program should be briefed on the major components of the program \nas they relate to their needs. EC officers will provide the following: \n• \nThe program’s Participant Guide; with particular emphasis on: \n♦ membership rights and obligations. This would include the obligation to carry proof of \ncitizenship and permanent resident status;  \n• \nOther government departments’ requirements; \n• \nOther travel documents that may be required, including work and study permits; \n• \nCurrency reporting obligations.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n16 \n8.6. \nThe membership card \nThe card is a trigger for accessing the relevant program’s database. It does not have any \nprivileged, personal or financial information on it. \nMember must be aware that lost or stolen membership cards are to be reported immediately to \none of the government partners. \nThe membership card is not an official travel document. \nApproved applicants are issued the appropriate identification card. This card remains the property \nof the Canadian and U.S. governments. \n9. \nPassage \nParticipation in these programs shall not be authorized for the purpose of circumventing the \nprovisions of the Act or its Regulations. Members seeking entry into Canada or the U.S. may be \nsubject to a random immigration examination at the discretion of an officer.  CBSA immigration \nofficers will rigorously enforce the Act and its Regulations when a violation is encountered during \na secondary examination. Further, any documentation issued under the provisions of the AME \nprograms will not replace the requirement for the member to have in their possession official \ntravel documents demonstrating their citizenship, resident status or other status obtained from \nCIC, the CBSA immigration or the U.S. CBP. \n9.1. \nTechnology at passage  \nA wide variety of technology exists to assist CBSA and U.S. CBP officers in the risk assessment \nof AME program members seeking entry into Canada and the U.S.   \nMembers seeking entry into Canada or the U.S. by land using a dedicated lane are required to \npresent their program-specific membership card.   \nFor the FAST program, PIL officers are required to swipe the member’s card through a magnetic \nstrip reader which validates the member’s status.  Proximity technology is used by FAST \nmembers entering the U.S. \nIn the case of the NEXUS Highway program, members present their card to a proximity reader \n(where the technology is available) so that a PIL officer may verify their identity and confirm \nmembership status.  \nWhen travelling by air, members of the CANPASS Air or NEXUS Air program seeking entry into \nCanada or the U.S. use automated kiosks to capture their iris in order to confirm their identity by \ncomparing it to information contained within the secure database. These programs utilize the \nphoto capture found on the membership card as a secondary method of identification.   \n9.2. \nReferrals \nThough it has been shown that there are few customs or immigration program violations by AME \nmembers, it is necessary to have checks and balances in place. These measures have been \ncreated to ensure compliance and integrity with the programs, government laws and regulations.  \nViolations will result in definitive sanctions. \nAME program members are advised at the interview that each agency involved in the program \nretains the right to randomly refer members for further inspection.   \nThe Participant’s Guide of each program also states that anytime a member enters the U.S. or \nCanada, border officials of their respective country may perform a full inspection.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n17 \n \nReferrals and CBSA immigration secondary examination \nAny intentional violation of any of the program’s terms and conditions, violation of law or new \nenforcement action taken against a member will warrant a mandatory referral.   \nExample: Mandatory referrals to CBSA immigration secondary examination include:  \n\u001fA member who is travelling on expired immigration status documents; \n\u001fThe member’s name is an exact match on the FOSS enforcement database. \nProcedures for mandatory referrals also apply for all other referrals, including selective and \nrandom referrals. \nAny violation of AME program rules that is discovered at the time of passage at the POE must be \ndocumented and sent to the CBSA PC. Members found in violation of an AME program may be \nfaced with sanctions ranging from a verbal warning at the time of passage followed by a letter, \nmembership suspension, and even membership cancellation depending on the specific program. \nSee the procedures for the specific AME program for the necessary reporting mechanisms when \na program violation occurs. \n9.3. \nSeizure of participant membership card \nIf during a secondary examination a CBSA immigration officer is of the opinion that a person is \ninadmissible to Canada, the officer may seize the person’s membership card pursuant to \nsubsection A140(1), fill out the IMM 5265 \"Notice of Seizure,\" and provide a copy to that person.  \nWhen a CBSA immigration officer seizes a membership card, they are to send an e-mail to their \nimmediate supervisor and to the applicable CBSA IPC. The e-mail should contain the section of \nthe Act that was used to determine inadmissibility, the client’s FOSS number, the date of the \nseizure, the client’s membership card number and the officer's name and badge number.   \nThe officer’s supervisor will then be responsible to advise the CBSA superintendent at the POE of \nthe seizure information. This must be done in writing, accompanied by the membership card.  \nThis process has been created in order to have the membership privileges suspended or revoked \nby the CBSA Customs and to ensure that they update their appropriate databases. Where \nmemberships have been suspended or revoked, clients may seek redress by requesting a review \nfrom the CBSA Customs.\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n18 \nAppendix \nA Immigration violations \nThe following chart is to be used by CBSA IPC officers when reviewing applicant information. \nOnce admissibility to Canada has been determined, CBSA IPC officers will further review the \nFOSS database for documented immigration violations. CBSA IPC officers are asked to use this \neligibility matrix to provide a recommendation of “pass” or “fail” based on the following criteria:   \nNote: Admissibility to Canada supersedes all other program eligibility criteria. \n \n• \nProgram \n• \nEligibility criteria: Immigration \nviolations \n• \nNEXUS \n• \nClients may be eligible to participate in the \nNEXUS program if no documented immigration \nviolation appears on their FOSS record.

(See section \nWhat “the final disposition date means below.)  \n \nWhat “documented immigration violation” means: \nAn inadmissibility report has been transmitted to the Minister under A44(1) and the Minister or the \nMinister’s delegate is of the opinion that the report is well-founded and a removal order has been \nmade.   \nException A40(2)(a): The definition of an immigration violation also includes a determination of \ninadmissibility for misrepresentation that is made outside Canada in which case, a permanent \nresident or foreign national continues to be inadmissible for a period of two years. In these cases, \nthe final disposition date is the date of the final determination of inadmissibility under A40(1). \nNote: An inadmissibility report and a conditional removal order made with respect to a refugee claim will \nnot be considered as an immigration violation if the refugee claim was successful. Where criminality \nwas recorded at the time of the report, the assessment on the recommendation will be based on the \ncriminality. \nWritten proof of one of the following under immigration law: \n• \nHuman smuggling and trafficking;  \n• \nOffences related to documents; \n• \nGeneral offences;  \n• \nProceeds of crime;  \n• \nOfficers authorized to enforce the Act;  \n• \nTicketable Offences;\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n19 \n• \nCollection of debts due to Her Majesty. \n \nWhat “the final disposition date” means:  \nThe date on which the removal order has been made, whether or not this removal order is \nenforceable pursuant to A48. \nException A40(2)(a):  The definition of an immigration violation also includes a determination of \ninadmissibility for misrepresentation that is made outside Canada in which case a permanent \nresident or foreign national continues to be inadmissible for a period of two years. In these cases, \nthe final disposition date is the date of the final determination of inadmissibility made pursuant to \nA40 (1). \nNote: Where a report is still before the Minister's delegate under A44(2) or has been referred to the \nImmigration Division, the eligibility determination must be put on hold until the outcome of the \ninadmissibility hearing is known. If a removal order is under appeal to the IAD or the subject of judicial \nreview before the courts, the eligibility recommendation will be negative, i.e., fail. \nTo determine the final disposition date of any immigration violation included in “Part 3 \nEnforcement” of the Act relating to: \n• \nHuman smuggling and trafficking; \n• \nOffence related to documents; \n• \nGeneral offences;  \n• \nProceeds of crime;  \n• \nOfficers authorized to enforce the Act;  \n• \nTicketable offences;  \n• \nCollection of debts due to Her Majesty;  \nrefer the case to the AME Travellers’ Programs, Immigration Ports and Border Management, \nBorder and Compliance Programs Directorate, Admissibility—CBSA at: ais@cic.gc.ca\nENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n20 \n \nAppendix \nB  Letter requesting additional information to determine \nadmissibility and residency \n \nPERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL  \n \nThis letter is for the eyes of the addressee only.
