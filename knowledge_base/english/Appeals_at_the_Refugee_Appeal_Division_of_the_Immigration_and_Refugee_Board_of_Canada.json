It is an error-driven \nexercise. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) gives certain refugee \nclaimants (some refugee claimants do not have access to the RAD) and the Minister the \nopportunity to appeal an RPD decision based on error in law, in fact or in mixed law and \nfact.   \n3. \nComing into force \nThe RAD came into force on December 15, 2012 (see Statutory Instruments/2012-94). \nNote: A drafting error in the Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act that allowed certain \ncategories of asylum claimants from the previous system to appeal to the RAD has been \ncorrected. This change came into effect on June 26, 2013 with Royal Assent for the \nEconomic Action Plan Act 2013, Part I (EAPA). Pursuant to section 167 of the EAPA, asylum \nclaimants who were referred to the IRB between August 15, 2012 and December 14, 2012 \nand whose claims had not been decided by the RPD as of June 26, 2013 do not have \naccess to the RAD. Those claimants whose claims were referred to the IRB between August \n15, 2012 and December 14, 2012 and their claims had been decided by the RPD before \nJune 26, 2013 are entitled to access the RAD. \n4. \nDefinitions \nNote: References to IRPA appear in the text with an \"A\" prefix followed by the section number. \nReferences to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) appear with a “R” \nprefix followed by the section number. \n \nDesignated Country of Origin \n(DCO) \nCountries designated by the Minister under A109.1. The \ncurrent list of DCOs can be found at  \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/reform-safe.asp \nOn July 23rd, 2015 the Federal Court (2015 FC 892) found the \nrestriction under A110(2)(d.1) unconstitutional. Since that date \nclaimants from DCO countries have had a right to appeal to \nthe RAD.  \nNote that the IRB considered failed claimants deemed to have \nreceived their RPD decision by July 8, 2015 (15 days before \nthe FC decision) to be within the time limit to file an appeal at \nthe RAD. \nDesignated Foreign Nationals \nA DFN is a foreign national – other than a foreign national\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n5 \n(DFN) \nreferred to in A19 – who is part of a group that has been \ndesignated as an irregular arrival under A20.1(1) unless, on \narrival, the foreign national holds the visa or other document \nrequired under the regulations and, on examination, the officer \nis satisfied the foreign national is not inadmissible [A20.1(2)].  \nA designation may be made under IRPA A20.1.(1) regarding \nan arrival in Canada of a group of persons retroactively to \nMarch 31, 2009 [Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act \n(Related Provisions 2012, c.17) s.81]. \nA claimant who is a DFN has no right of appeal to the RAD \n[A110(2)(a)]. \nException to the Safe Third \nCountry Agreement \nPersons arriving at a Canadian land border port of entry from \nthe United States (US) who make a claim for refugee \nprotection may have their claim determined by the IRB if they \nmeet at least one of the exceptions to the Safe Third Country \nAgreement. The Agreement was signed between Canada and \nthe US dated December 5, 2002 and came into effect on \nDecember 29, 2004. These exceptions are outlined in \nregulations made under A102(1)(c). \nThere is no right of appeal to the RAD when an exception to \nthe safe third country agreement applies to the claimant \n[A110(2)(d)].  \nNo Credible Basis (NCB) \nThe RPD must state in its reasons for the decision that there is \nno credible basis for the claim if it is of the opinion that there \nwas no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have \nmade a favourable decision [A107(2)].  \nThere is no right of appeal to the RAD for RPD decisions that \nhave NCB [A110(2)(c)]. \nManifestly Unfounded Claim \n(MUC) \nThe RPD must state in its reasons for the decision that the \nclaim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the \nclaim is clearly fraudulent [A107.1].  \nThere is no right of appeal to the RAD for a MUC [A110(2)(c)]. \nVacation  \n \nThe RPD may vacate a decision to allow a claim, if on \napplication by the Minister, the RPD finds that the decision \nwas obtained as a result of directly or indirectly \nmisrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a \nrelevant matter. If the application is allowed, the claim will be \ndeemed to be rejected and the decision that led to the \nconferral of refugee protection will be nullified.  \nThere is no right of appeal to the RAD for a decision of the \nRPD allowing or rejecting an application by the Minister to \nvacate a decision allowing a refugee protection claim \n[A110(2)(f)]. \nCessation \nOn application by the Minister the RPD may determine that the \nrefugee protection referred to in A95(1) has ceased for any of \nthe reasons described in A108(1). If the application is allowed, \nthe claim of the person is deemed to be rejected [A108(2), \n108(3)]. \nThere is no right of appeal to the RAD for a decision of the \nRPD allowing or rejecting an application by the Minister for a\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n6 \ndetermination that refugee protection has ceased [A110(2)(e)]. \n5. \nTables showing applicable provisions in IRPA, IRPR and RADR \nThe tables below summarize the provisions of the IRPA, IRPR and the RAD Rules \n(RADR) that are applicable to refugees and to persons in need of protection in the \ncontext of CBSA-led appeals and interventions before the RAD. \n \nTable 1: Legislative provisions concerning the protection of refugees \nFor information on:  \nRefer to section(s): \nDefinitions \nA2 \nObjectives \nA3 \nDesignation – human smuggling or other irregular arrival \nA20.1 \nConferral of refugee protection \nA95(1) \nDefinition of protected person \nA95(2) and A97 \nDefinition of Convention refugee \nA96 \nDefinition of person in need of protection \nA97 \nExclusion from the definition of Convention refugee or from the \ndefinition of person in need of protection \nA98 \nClaim for refugee protection \nA99 \nEligibility of refugee protection claim \nA100 and A102 \nIneligibility of refugee protection claim \nA101 \nSuspension of a refugee protection claim by the RPD \nA103 \nNotice of ineligibility \nA104 \nExtradition procedure \nA105 \nCredibility of claimant \nA106 \nDeterminiation on refugee claims by the RPD \nA107 \nNo credible basis \nA107(2) \nManifestly unfounded refugee protection claim (MUC) \nA107.1 \nCessation of refugee protection by the RPD \nA108 \nVacation of refugee protection by the RPD \nA109 \nDesignated countries of origin (DCO) \nA109.1 \n \nTable 2: IRPA provisions concerning or impacting the RAD \nFor information on:  \nRefer to section(s):  \nAppeal to RAD \nA110 \nDecision of the RAD \nA111 \nRegulations \nA111.1 \nComposition of the IRB / Head Office and Staff / Duties of \nChairperson \nA151 to A160 \nFunctioning of the IRB \nA161 \nJurisdiction of each Division of the IRB \nA162 \nComposition of panels \nA163 \nPresence of parties \nA164 \nPowers of a commissioner \n \nA165 \nProceedings – all Divisions \nA166 \nCounsel and representation \nA167 \nAbandonment and abuse of process \nA168 \nDecisions and reasons \nA169 \nNo reopening of claim or application when RAD or the Federal \nCourt has made a final determination \nA170.2 \nRAD Proceedings \nA171\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n7 \nNo reopening of appeal when Federal Court has made a final \ndetermination \nA171.1 \nRemedial and disciplinary measures \nA176 to A186 \nTransitional provision: pending or in progress applications, \nproceedings or matters under former Act are now governed by \nthe new Act upon coming into force \nA190 \nTransitional provision: decision by RPD from a hearing \ncommenced by the CRDD is not subject to appeal under A110 \nA194 \nTransitional provision: decision by CRDD made before coming \ninto force of A195 is not subject to an appeal under A110 \nA195 \nLeave for judicial review (JR) \nA72 \nMinister’s right to make an application for leave to commence an \napplication for JR of any RAD decision whether or not the Minister \ntook part in the RPD proceedings \nA73 \nBalanced Refugee Reform Act (Related Provision: 2010, c.8, \ns.33, as amended by Related Provision 2012, c.17, s.66: refugee \nprotection claim referred \n \nRP 33 \nRelated Provision: 2010, c.8, s.36, as amended by Related \nProvision 2012, c.17, s.68: no appeal \nRP 36 \nRelated Provision: 2010, c.8, s.37, as amended by Related \nProvision 2012, c.17, s.68: decision set aside in judicial review \nRP 37 \n \nNote: The Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) was the administrative tribunal \nresponsible for determining refugee claims under Canada’s previous Immigration Act.

The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness (Minister of PS) and the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship \nCanada (Minister of IRCC) (then the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) were both \ngiven the ministerial responsibilities under A110 and A171 however the Minister of PS \nwas only given this responsibility with respect to those matters for which he or she is \nresponsible under the Act. \n7. \nCBSA hearings officer role and responsibilities \n7.1. \nDelegated ministerial responsibility \nIn January 2015 the Minister of IRCC (then Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) \ndelegated the ministerial responsibilities pertaining to A110 and A171 specifically \nA110(1), A110(1.1), A110(3), A171(a), A171(a.1), A171(a.4) and A171(a.5) to, inter alia, \nCBSA hearings officers. For more information on the other positions delegated ministerial \nresponsibilities pertaining to the RAD please refer to the most recent instrument of \ndelegation. \n7.2. \nProfessional conduct as Minister’s delegate \nIn the capacity as the Minister’s delegate, a hearings officer  \n(a) is a firm advocate of the Minister's position; \n(b) should always be aware that he/she is speaking and acting on behalf of the Minister, \nand that the positions and actions taken should reflect IRCC and CBSA departmental \npolicy;  \n(c) should always be professional and respect decorum, as well as maintain \nprofessionalism in his/her telephone manner, written correspondence, conduct at \nhearings and all interactions with the public; \n(d) should exhibit professionalism by adequately preparing for cases;  \n(e) should treat all persons with whom he/she interacts with dignity and respect.  \n7.3. \nConsultation/Concurrence from Litigation Management  \nA CBSA hearings officer must seek approval from his/her manager prior to filing and \nperfecting appeals on behalf of the Minister.   \nFor some cases, litigation mangement (CBSA or IRCC) at national headquarters must be \nconsulted or concur with the appeal filed to the RAD (see Appendix 1). \nNote: When consulting with or requesting concurrence from litigation management via email, \nthe Hearings manager should copy the CBSA Programs and Operations units responsible \nfor hearings at national headquarters via Hearings-Audiences-Programs@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n10 \n8. \nThe Refugee Appeal Division \n8.1. \nWho can appeal to the RAD & grounds of appeal \nA person or the Minister may file and perfect an appeal against an RPD decision which \nhas allowed or rejected the person’s claim for refugee protection provided the \nenumerated restrictions do not apply (see section below: When you cannot appeal to the \nRAD). \nAn appeal may be brought to the RAD, when restrictions do not apply, on the grounds \nthat the RPD committed an error of law, of fact or of mixed law and fact. [A110(1)] \n8.2. \nDeadlines to file and perfect an appeal \nA110(2.1) requires that an appeal must be filed and perfected within the time limits set \nout in the Regulations. Pursuant to A111.1(1)(d), regulations may include provisions \nrespecting time limits for the filing and perfecting of an appeal under A110(2.1).  \nPursuant to R159.91(1)(a), the time limit for a person or the Minister to file an appeal to \nthe RAD against a decision of the RPD is 15 days after the day on which the person or \nthe Minister receives written reasons for the decision.  \nPursuant to R159.91(1)(b), the time limit for a person or the Minister to perfect an appeal \nis 30 days after the day on which the person or the Minister receives written reasons for \nthe decision.  \nR159.91(2) provides that if the appeal cannot be filed within the time limit set out in \nR159.91(1)(a) or perfected within the time limit set out in R159.91(1)(b), the RAD may, for \nreasons of fairness and natural justice, extend each of those time limits by the number of \ndays that is necessary in the circumstances.  \nRADR 35(3) provides that when a time limit for providing a document ends on a day that \nis not a working day, the time limit is extended to the next working day. RADR 1 defines \n“working day” as not including Saturdays, Sundays or other days on which the IRB offices \nare closed. \n8.3. \nWhen you cannot appeal to the RAD \nNo appeal to the RAD may be made in the following situations: \n \na decision of the RPD in respect of a claim made by a designated foreign national \n[A110(2)(a)]; \n \na determination by the RPD that a claim was withdrawn or abandoned [A110(2)(b)]; \n \na decision of the RPD rejecting a claim that states that the claim has no credible \nbasis or is manifestly unfounded [A110(2)(c)]; \n \na decision of the RPD in respect of a claim that was referred based on an exception \nto the Safe Third Country Agreement [A110(2)(d)]; \n \na decision of the RPD in respect of the Minister’s application for a determination that \nrefugee protection has ceased [A110(2)(e)]; \n \na decision of the RPD in respect of the Minister’s application to vacate a decision to \nallow a claim for refugee protection [A110(2)(f)];  \n \na notice provided by an officer under A104; \n \nthe claim has been deemed rejected because of an order of surrender under the \nExtradition Act [A105]; \n \na decision of the RPD following a hearing that had been commenced by the CRDD \n[A194];\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n11 \n \na decision of the CRDD made before December 15, 2012 [A195];  \n \na decision of the RPD in respect of a claim that was referred before August 15, 2012 \n[Related Provision – 2010, c.8, s.36, as amended by 2012, c.17, s.68] and if any \nsuch decision is set aside by the Federal Court in a judicial review, the \nredetermination of that decision by a member of the RPD appointed under A169.1 \n[Related Provision 2010, c.8, s.37, as amended by 2012, c.17, s.68]; and \n \na decision of the RPD in respect of a claim that was referred after August 14, 2012 \nbut before December 15, 2012, if the decision takes effect after June 26, 2013 [s.167 \nof the Economic Action Plan Act 2013, Part I] and any such decision is set aside in \njudicial review, the redetermination of that decision by a member of the RPD \nappointed under A169.1 [s.168 of the BIA]. \nNote: Where a decision of the RPD may be appealed to the RAD, this right of appeal must be \nexhausted before making an application to the Federal Court for leave to seek judicial \nreview. \nNote: The RAD does not have jurisdiction to reopen an appeal it has decided and with respect \nto which the Federal Court has made a final decision [A171.1]. \nNote: On July 23rd, 2015 the Federal Court (2015 FC 892) found the restriction under \nA110(2)(d.1) unconstitutional. Since that date claimants from DCO countries have had a \nright to appeal to the RAD. \n8.4. \nRole of the RAD and Apellant’s onus \nAccording to the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) \nv. Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93 (Huruglica) the RAD is a safety net intended to catch all \nmistakes made by the RPD. Its role, therefore, is to correct where the RPD is wrong in \nlaw, in fact or in fact and law.  \nThe FCA stated that the RAD is first to carefully consider the RPD decision, then carry \nout its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the appellant, \nthe RPD erred, and then to provide a final determination – confirm, set aside and \nsubstitute its own determination, or refer the matter back to the RPD.  \nThe FCA determined that with respect to questions of law and findings of fact or mixed \nfact and law that do not raise an issue of credibility of oral evidence the RAD is to review \nthe RPD decision by applying a standard of correctness. The FCA did not speak to which \nstandard should apply to findings of fact or mixed fact and law that do raise an issue of \ncredibility of oral evidence. \nIn a decision that predates Huruglica, the Federal Court in Dhillon v. Canada (Citizenship \nand Immigration), 2015 FC 321 (Dhillon) stated that the RAD’s authority to substitute its \ndecision with that of the RPD does not entail a duty to speculate as to what might have \nbeen a better approach to a failed refugee claimant’s appeal. Nor may the RAD find that \nthe claim should have been accepted based on risks that were not raised by the claimant \nin the first place. It is the appellant’s responsibility, not the RAD’s, to establish that the \nRPD erred in a way that justifies the intervention of the RAD. It is not the RAD’s function \nto supplement the weaknesses of an appeal before it or to come up with ideas that might \nassist appellants in succeeding with their appeal. \nIn a decision that postdates Huruglica the Federal Court in Murugesu v. Canada (Minister \nof Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 819 (Murugesu) followed Dhillon and the obiter \ncomments made by Justice Gleeson in Ghauri v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigraiton), 2016 FC 548 holding that appellants before the RAD who fail to specify \nwhere and how the RPD erred do so at their peril. The Federal Court noted that RADR \n3(3)(g) places the onus on the appellant to identify in their Memorandum the errors that \nare the grounds of the appeal and the location of the errors in the RPD’s decision or in \nthe audio or other electronic recording of the RPD hearing.\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n12 \n8.5. \nComposition of panel \nAppeals to the RAD are reviewed and decided by a single member unless the \nChairperson is of the opinion that a panel of three members should be constituted [A163]. \nIf the Chairperson orders a proceeding to be conducted by a three member panel, the \nRAD must without delay notify the parties in writing. This notice includes the Minister \n(even if the Minister has not intervened in the appeal) and the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) [RADR 43]. \nA decision made by a three-member panel is binding on the RPD and on single member \npanels of the RAD [A171(c)]. This will create consistency of decisions and contribute to a \nrobust refugee protection adjuducative strategy. \n8.6. \nPowers and authorities of RAD members \nMembers of the RAD have the powers and authority of a commissioner appointed under \npart I of the Inquiries Act, and may do any other thing they consider necessary to provide \na full and proper hearing [A165].   \nThe powers and authority of a commissioner appointed under Part 1 of the Inquiries Act \ninclude the power of summoning before them witnesses, and if requiring the witness to \ngive evidence, orally or in writing under oath or, if entitled, by affirmation under solemn \ndeclaration, and to produce such documents and things as the commissioner deems \nrequisite to the full investigation of the matters into which the commissioner is appointed \nto examine (see section 4, Inquiries Act). The commissioner has the same power to \nenforce the attendance of a witness and to compel the witness to give evidence as is \nvested in any court of record in civil cases (see seection 5, Inquiries Act). \nThe RAD member is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence [A171(a.2)] \nand may receive and base a decision on evidence that is adduced in the proceeding and \nconsidered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances [A171(a.3)].  \nThe RAD member may take notice of any facts that may be judicially noticed and of any \nother generally recognized facts and any information or opinion that is within his or her \nspecialized knowledge [A171(b)]. Before using any information or opinion that is within \nthe RAD member’s specialized knowledge the RAD member must notify the parties and \ngive them an opportunity to make representations on the reliability and use of the \ninformation or opinion and provide evidence in support of their representations [RADR \n24]. \nIn the absence of a provision in the RADR dealing with a matter raised during the \nproceedings, the RAD member may do whatever is necessary to deal with the matter \n[RADR 52]. \nThe RAD member may, after giving the parties notice and an opportunity to object, (a) act \non his or her own initiative, without a party having to make an application or request to \nthe RAD; (b) change a requirement of a rule; (c) excuse a person from a requirement of a \nrule; and (d) extend a time limit, before or after the time limit has expired, or shorten it if \nthe time limit has not expired [RADR 53]. \nFailure to follow any requirement in the RADR does not make the proceedings invalid \nunless proceedings are declared invalid by the RAD member [RADR 54]. \nThe RAD, similar to all divisions of the IRB, has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction in \nrespect of proceedings brought before it under the IRPA to hear and determine all \nquestions of law and fact, including questions of jurisdiction [A162(1)].  \nThe RAD, similar to all divisions of the IRB, shall deal with all proceedings before it as \ninformally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and \nnatural justice permit [A162(2)]. \n8.7. \nPaper-based appeals \nPursuant to A110(3), subject to the provisions set out in A110(3.1), A110(4) and A110(6) \nthe RAD must proceed without a hearing on the basis of the record of the proceedings of\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n13 \nthe RPD and may accept any documentary evidence and written submissions from the \nMinister and the person who is the subject of the appeal (and when the matter is heard \nby a panel of three members then also written submissions by the UNHCR representative \nand any other person described in the RADR). \nA110(4) restricts the evidence which the person who is the subject of the appeal may \npresent. He or she is only allowed to present evidence that arose after the rejection of \nhis/her claim, that was not reasonably available or that he/she could not reasonably have \nbeen expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection. \nA110(4) does not apply to the Minister. \nThe FCA in Minister of Citizenship & Immigration v. Singh, 2016 FCA 96 (Singh) stated \nthat the explicit provisions in A110(4) are inescapable and leave no room for discretion \non the part of the RAD. Hence, evidence submitted under A110(3) by an appellant who is \nthe subject of the appeal must meet one of the three categories set out under A110(4).  \nFurther, the FCA in Singh stated that the Raza factors (credibility, relevance, newness \nand materiality) (see Raza v. Minister of Citizenship & Immigration, 2007 FCA 385) apply \nto the assessment under A110(4) as they do in the context of Pre-Removal Risk \nAssessments with an adaptation of the materiality criterion – the new evidence does not \nneed to be determiniative in and of itself so long as it may have an impact on the RAD’s \noverall assessment of the RPD’s decision.  \nNote: A110(5) states that A110(4) does not apply in respect of evidence that is presented in \nresponse to evidence presented by the Minister. \nRADR 3(3)(c) provides that the person who is the subject of the appeal may file any \ndocument that the RPD refused to accept as evidence, during or after the hearing, if he \nor she wants to rely on the documents in his or her appeal. RADR 10(3)(c) provides that \nthe person who is the subject of an appeal in response to a Minister’s appeal may \nprovide any documentary evidence that he or she wants to rely on in the appeal.  \n8.8. \nRPD Record \nThe RAD must without delay provide a copy of the notice of appeal to the RPD after the \nappeal is perfected [RADR 21(1)]. The RPD must prepare a record and provide it to the \nRAD no later than 10 days after the day on which the RPD receives the notice of appeal \n[RADR 21(2)].  \nRADR 21(3) sets out what must be included in the RPD record: \n(a) the notice of decision and written reasons for the decision that is being appealed; \n(b) the Basis of Claim Form as defined in the Refugee Protection Division Rules and any \nchanges or additions to it; \n(c) all documentary evidence that the RPD accepted as evidence, during or after the \nhearing; \n(d) any written representations made during or after the hearing but before the decision \nbeing appealed was made; and \n(e) any audio or other electronic recording of the hearing. \nIf the Minister did not take part in the proceedings relating to the decision being appealed, \nthe RAD must provide a copy of the RPD record to the Minister as soon as the RAD \nreceives it [RADR 21(4)].  \nNote: The IRB interprets “take part in the proceedings” to mean intervention in any form (in \nperson or in writing only).  \n8.9. \nHolding a hearing \nPursuant to A110(6), the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, documentary evidence \ndisclosed at the RAD (beyond the RPD record) (a) raises a serious issue with respect to \nthe credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal, (b) is central to the decision\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n14 \nwith respect to the refugee protection claim, and (c) if accepted, would justify allowing or \nrejecting the refugee protection claim.  \nThe FCA in Singh made it clear that the RAD’s discretion on whether to hold a hearing is \nlimited in that these three requirements in A110(6) must be present. \nAccording to A171(a) the RAD must give notice of any hearing to both the Minister and \nthe person who is the subject of the appeal. This notice must be in writing and provide \nthe date, time and location fixed for the hearing and the issues that will be raised at the \nhearing [RADR 56(1)]. \nThe date fixed for the hearing must not be earlier than 10 days after the day which the \nperson who is the subject of the appeal and the Minister receive the notice, unless they \nconsent to an earlier date [RADR 56(2)]. \nA hearing is restricted to matters relating to the issues provided with the notice to appear \nunless the RAD considers that other issues have been raised by statements made by the \nperson who is the subject of an appeal or by a witness during the hearing [RADR 57(1)]. \nA171(a.1) provides that when a hearing is held the RAD must give the person who is the \nsubject of the appeal and the Minister the opportunity to present evidence, question \nwitnesses and make submissions. \nWhen a hearing is held, unless the RAD orders otherwise, any witness, including the \nperson who is the subject of an appeal, will be questioned first by the appellant, then by \nany other party, then by the appellant in reply, and then by the RAD [RADR 57(2)]. \nNote: When the Minister intervenes in an appeal and is seeking exclusion under article 1F or \n1E of the Refugee Convention (not previously dealt with at the RPD), the Minister’s counsel \nshould make an application to the RAD to allow the Minister’s counsel to start the questioning \non exclusion followed by the appellant’s counsel and finishing with the Minister’s counsel in \nreply. This will allow the exclusion issue to be fully canvassed by the Minister who has the \nonus of establishing exclusion.  \nThe RAD may limit the questioning of witnesses, including the person who is the subject \nof an appeal, taking into account the nature and complexity of the issues and the \nrelevance of the questions [RADR 57(3)]. \nWhere a hearing is held, the RAD may, in its discretion, conduct the hearing in the \npresence of, or by means of live telecommunication with, the person who is the subject of \nthe appeal [A164]. \nThe RAD may order a person who holds the person who is the subject of the appeal in \ncustody to bring the person to a proceeding at a location specified by the RAD [RADR \n58]. \nRepresentations must be made orally at the end of the hearing unless the RAD orders \notherwise [RADR 57(4)]. After all the evidence has been heard, the RAD must set time \nlimits for representations, taking into account the complexity of the issues and the amount \nof relevant evidence heard and indicate what issues need to be addressed in the \nrepresentations [RADR 57(5)]. \n8.10. \nDecisions at RAD \nThe RAD has the authority to (a) confirm the determination of the RPD, (b) set aside the \ndetermination of the RPD and substitute a determination that, in its opinion, should have \nbeen made; or (c) refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination, giving direction to the \nRPD that it considers appropriate [A111]. \nOther than an interlocutory decision, a decision made by the RAD must be rendered in \nwriting [A169(c)] and reasons for the decision must be given [A169(b)]. \nWhen the RAD makes a decision, other than an interlocutory decision, the RAD must \nprovide in writing a notice of decision to the person who is the subject of the appeal, to \nthe Minister and the RPD. It must also provide a notice of the decision to the UNHCR and\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n15 \nto any interested person, if they provided written submissions in the appeal [RADR \n50(1)]. \nThe RAD must provide written reasons for the decision, together with the notice of \ndecision if a hearing was not held or was held and the decision and reasons were not \ngiven orally at the hearing. [RADR 50(2)]. \nIf the person who is the subject of the appeal or the Minister request written reasons for a \ndecision within 10 days of notification of the decision, or in the circumstances set out in \nthe RADR, the RAD must provide written reasons [A169(e)]. The RADR require that a \nrequest for written reasons for a decision must be made in writing [RADR 50(3)]. \nOther than an interlocutory decision, the decision takes effect in accordance with the \nRADR [A169(a)]. A decision, other than an interlocutory decision, made by a single RAD \nmember takes effect (a) if made in writing, when the RAD member signs and dates the \nreasons for the decision; and (b) if given orally at a hearing, when the RAD member \nstates the decision and gives the reasons [RADR 51(1)]. \nA decision, other than an interlocutory decision, made by a panel of three RAD members \ntakes effect (a) if made in writing, when all three RAD members sign and date their \nreasons for the decision; and (b) if given orally at a hearing, when all three RAD \nmembers state their decision and give their reasons [RADR 51(2)]. \nUnless a hearing is held the RAD must make a decision within the time limits set out in \nthe regulations [A110(3.1)]. IRPR 159.92(1) provides that, except where a hearing is held \nunder A110(6), the time limit for the RAD to make a decision on an appeal is 90 days \nafter the day on which the appeal is perfected. If it is not possible for the RAD to render \nits decision within 90 days after the appeal is perfected, the decision must be made as \nsoon as feasible after that time limit [IRPR 159.92(2)]. \nWhere an appeal is brought by the person who is the subject of the appeal, and unless a \nhearing is held, the RAD may, without further notice to the appellant and the Minister, \ndecide an appeal on the basis of the materials provided (a) if a period of 15 days has \npassed since the day on which the Minister received the appellant’s record, or the time \nlimit for perfecting the appeal set out in the IRPR has expired; or (b) if the appellant’s \nreply record has been provided or the time for providing it has expired [RADR 7]. \nWhere an appeal is brought by the Minister, unless a hearing is held, the RAD may, \nwithout futher notice to the parties, decide an appeal on the basis of the materials \nprovided (a) if a period of 15 days has passed since the day on which the Minister \nreceived the respondent’s record, or the time limit for providing the respondent’s record \nhas expired; or (b) if the Minister’s reply has been provided [RADR 13].  \nThe RPD does not have jurisdiction to reopen, on any ground (including failure to \nobserve a principle of natural justice), a claim for refugee protection, an application for \nprotection or an application for cessation or vacation, in respect of which the RAD or the \nFederal Court, as the case may be, has made a final determination [A170.2]. \nAt any time before the Federal Court has made a final determination in respect of an \nappeal that has been decided or declared abandoned, the appellant may make an \napplication to the RAD to reopen the appeal [RADR 49]. RADR 49(2) through to 49(9) set \nout the rules in respect of an application to reopen an appeal. \n8.11. \nSending a matter back to the RPD for re-determination \nAfter considering the appeal, the RAD may refer the matter to the RPD for re-\ndetermination, giving the direction to the RPD that it considers appropriate [A111(1)(c)]. \nIn order for the RAD to send a matter back to the RPD for re-determination the RAD must \nbe of the opinion that (a) the RPD decision is wrong in law, in fact or in mixed law and \nfact, and (b) the RAD member cannot make a decision to either confirm the RPD \ndetermination or to set aside the RPD determination and substitute his/her own decision \nwithout hearing evidence that was presented to the RPD [A111(2)].\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n16 \nThe FCA in Huruglica noted that this possibility acknowledges the fact that in some cases \nwhere oral testimony is critical or determinative in the opinion of the RAD, the RAD may \nnot be in a position to confirm or substitute its own determination to that of the RPD. The \nFCA stated that there may be cases where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage over \nthe RAD in making findings of fact or mixed fact and law – because they require an \nassessment of the credibility or weight to be given to the oral evidence it hears and that \nthe RAD may exercise restraint in substituting its own decision. The FCA stated that in \neach case the RAD ought to determine whether the RPD truly benefited from an \nadvantageous position, and if so, whether the RAD can nevertheless make a final \ndecision in respect of the refugee claim. \n9. \nPolicy \n9.1. \nPriorities established by IRCC that may trigger an appeal from the Minister \nThe following cases should be reviewed and considered for appeal to the RAD:  \n \nCases that were subject to an intervention at the RPD. \n \nCases where the final outcome may establish a precedent that may impact the \nintegrity of the program.  \n \nCases that may affect the assessment of subsequent refugee claims at the RPD and \nRAD. (For example, the RPD gives protection to a French citizen or the RPD creates \na new particular social group in relation to the Convention Refugee definition).  \n \nCases that involve an oral hearing because these cases would involve new evidence \nand may raise credibility concerns. \n \nCases that will be assessed by a three member panel of the RAD as a decision of a \nthree member panel will have precedential value for the RPD and for all decisions of \nthe RAD. \n \nCases where the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or a \nthird party has notified the parties of the intention to provide written submissions. \n \nCases where new information is received after the RPD decision. \n \nCases where claimant has made an application for a re-opening of a recent negative \ndecision that has been granted by the respective Division, either under RPD Rule 62 \nor RAD Rule 49. \n \nCases selected at random.  \n9.2. \nDistribution of workload between CBSA and IRCC \nWith the introduction of the Reviews & Interventions (R&I) pilot project, IRCC Senior \nImmigration Officers (SIO) are responsible for appeals and interventions at RAD for \ncases involving (i) credibility, (ii) program integrity and (iii) exclusion under article 1 \nsection E of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee \nConvention).  \nCBSA hearings officers are responsible for appeals and interventions at RAD for cases \ninvolving (i) possible exclusion under article 1, section F of the Refugee Convention, (ii) \nwhere the claimant is or was in detention in Canada, (iii) where the claimant is a \ndesignated foreign national, (iv) in which a constitutional question is raised, and (v) a \ncombination of SIO responsibilities as well as CBSA hearings officer responsibilities. \nNote: Where a case is determined to be a hybrid case (having SIO and CBSA hearings officer \nresponsibilities) and the hearings officer elects not to pursue exclusion under article 1F of the \nRefugee Convention the hearings officer is required, in accordance with the commitment\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n17 \nmade by CBSA to IRCC, to consider intervention with respect to credibility, program integrity \nand/or article 1E and where it is warranted to pursue the same. \n10. \nOther Procedural Matters before the RAD \n10.1. \nParties \nRADR 1 defines a party to mean (a) in the case of an appeal by the person who is the \nsubject of an appeal, the person and, if the Minister intervenes in the appeal, the Minister, \nand (b) in the case of an appeal by the Minister, the Minister and the person who is the \nsubject of the appeal. \n10.2. \nOther Participants  \nThe UNHCR or other interested persons may participate in appeals that are held before \nthree member RAD panels [RADR 45 & 46].  \n10.3. \nUNHCR participation \nThe UNHCR must notify the RAD in writing of its intention to provide written submissions \nin an appeal conducted by a three-member panel [RADR 45(1)]. The UNHCR must \nprovide its written submissions within 10 days after the day of providing  its notice of \nintention [RADR 45(3)]. The requirements for UNHCR written submissions  are set out in \nRADR 45(4) & 45(5).  \nThe RAD must provide a copy of the UNHCR’s written submissions to the person who is \nthe subject of the appeal and to the Minister without delay. [RADR 45(6)]  \nRADR 45(7) to 45(12) set out the requirements for providing a written response to the \nUNHCR’s written submissions. A written response must be received by its recipients no \nlater than 7 days after the day on which the person who is the subject of the appeal or the \nMinister, as the case may be, receives the UNHCR’s written submissions [RADR 45(12)].  \n10.4. \nApplication by an interested person to participate \nAny person, other than the UNHCR, may make an application to the RAD to be allowed \nto participate in an appeal conducted by a three-member panel [RADR 46(1)]. RADR \n46(2) and 46(3) set out the requirements for the application.  \nRADR 46(4) to 46(7) set out the requirements for a response to the application. The \nresponse must be received no later than 10 days after the day on which the application is \nreceived [RADR 46(7)]. \nRADR 46(8) and 46(9) provide requirements for the notification of the decision on the \napplication and documents the RAD is required to provide the interested person.  \nRADR 46(10) to 46(13) provide requirements for the interested person’s written \nsubmissions. RADR 46(14) to 46(19) set out the requirements for the response to the \nwritten submissions. The response must be received no later than 7 days after the day on \nwhich the interested person’s written submissions are received [RADR 46(19)].   \n10.5. \nLanguage of the appeal  \nA person who is the subject of an appeal must choose English or French as the language \nof the appeal. The person must indicate the language in the notice of appeal if they are \nthe appellant or in the notice of intent to respond if they are the respondent [RADR 22(1)].  \nWhen the Minister is the appellant the language of the appeal is the language that was \nchosen by the subject of the appeal in the RPD proceedings relating to the decision that \nis being appealed [RADR 22(2)]. \nThe person who is the subject of the appeal may change the language by providing \nnotice to the RAD and the Minister in writing without delay and if a date has been fixed for \na hearing then no later than 20 days before that date [RADR 22(3)].\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n18 \n10.6. \nProceedings in the absence of the public \nProceedings before the RAD must be held in the absence of the public [A166(c)]. \nA person may make a written application to the RAD to have the proceeding conducted in \npublic in accordance with RADR 42(2) to 42(5). For the purposes of RADR 42 the \nMinister is considered to be a party to the proceeding even if the Minister has not yet \nintervened in the appeal. The content of the application is set out under RADR 42(4).  \nIf a hearing date has been fixed, an oral application for a proceeding to be held in public \nmust not be allowed unless the person, with reasonable effort, could not have made a \nwritten application before that date [RADR42(3)].  \nThe requirements for a response to the application are set out in RADR 46(6) to 46(9). \nThe content of a response to the application is set out in RADR 42(6). If the Minister \nresponds to a written application, the response must be accompanied by a notice of \nintervention in accordance with RADR 4(2), if one was not previously provided [RADR \n42(7)]. According to RADR 42(12) the RAD must specify the time limit within which a \nresponse is to be provided. \nPursuant to RADR 42(13), the RAD may take any measure it considers necessary to \nensure the confidentiality of the proceeding in respect of the application. Accordingly, the \nRAD may provide a summary of the response instead of a copy to the applicant [RADR \n42(9) and 49(13)]. RADR 42(14) sets out requirements where the RAD takes certain \nmeasures to ensure the confidentiality of the proceeding. \nRADR 42(10) to 42(12) set out requirements for replying to the response. RADR 42(15) \nrequires the RAD to notify the applicant and the parties of its decision on the application \nand provide reasons for the decision. \n10.7. \nRight to counsel  \nThe Minister and the person who is the subject of the appeal may, at their own expense, \nbe represented by legal or other counsel [A167]. The RADR includes provisions \nregarding notice requirements for when counsel is retained after providing a notice of \nappeal or notice of intent to respond, as the case may be, by the person who is the \nsubject of the appeal [RADR 16(1)], the effect of limitations on counsel’s retainer [RADR \n18(2)], changes to counsel’s contact information [RADR 16(2) and 16(3)], and removal of \ncounsel of record [RADR 19 and 20].  \nRADR 18(1) states that counsel becomes counsel of record for the person who is the \nsubject of the appeal as soon as he/she provides on behalf of the person who is the \nsubject of the appeal a notice of appeal or a notice of intent to respond, as the case may \nbe, or as soon as a person becomes counsel after the person provided notice.  \nRADR 31(4) states that a document to be provided to a person must be provided to the \nperson’s counsel of record if the person has counsel of record. If the person does not \nhave counsel of record the document must be provided to the person. \n10.8. \nDesignated representative \nThe RAD shall designate a person to represent any person who is under 18 years of age \nor is unable (in the opinion of the RAD) to appreciate the nature of the proceedings \n[A167(2)]. \nIf the RPD designated a representative for the person who is the subject of the appeal in \nthe RPD proceeding relating to the decision being appealed, the representative is \ndeemed to have been designated by the RAD unless the RAD orders otherwise [RADR \n23(1)]. \nIf the RPD did not designate a representative for the person who is the subject of the \nappeal and counsel for a party believes that the RAD should designate a representative \nbecause the person is under 18 years of age or is unable to appreciate the nature of the \nproceedings, counsel must without delay notify the RAD in writing [RADR23(2)]. The duty \nof counsel to notify does not apply in the case of a person under 18 years of age whose\nENF 26 Appeals at the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \n \n2017-01-31 \n \n19 \nappeal is joined with the appeal of their parent or legal guardian (who is over the age of \n18) [RADR23(3)]. RADR 23(4) sets out the requirements for the notice to designate a \nrepresentative.  \nRADR 23(5) to 23(11) set out rules related to the designation of a representative, the \nlength of the designation, termination of the delegation and responsibilities of the \nrepresentative. \n10.9. \nInterpreters \nIf the person who is the subject of an appeal needs an interpreter, he or she must \nindicate the language and dialect, if any, in their appellant’s record or respondent’s record \n(depending on the position they take in the appeal) [RADR 59(1)]. A person who is the \nsubject of an appeal may change the language and dialect, if any, or if they had not \nindicated that an interpreter was needed, they may do so by notifying the RAD in writing \nand indicating the language and dialect, if any. The notice must be received no later than \n20 days before the date fixed for the hearing [RADR 59(2)]. If any party’s witness needs \nan interpreter for a hearing, the party must notify the RAD in writing and specify the \nlanguage and dialect, if any.

Reporting procedures enable \nthe CBSA to make important decisions regarding the safety and security of staff, ongoing \ntraining needs, and the recognition of exemplary performance in difficult situations.
