It is designed to assist officers in planning, organizing and directing the \nremoval of foreign nationals from Canada who are the subject of departure, exclusion or deportation \norders. This also includes the process to verify/confirm departure of foreign nationals who are at a \nport of entry (POE) or a visa office outside Canada and are the subject of enforceable removal orders. \nIn addition, the latter part of this chapter, to be read in conjunction with the general removal policies \nand procedures, outlines specific procedures for the removal of foreign nationals to the United States. \n \n \n2  \nProgram Objectives \nThe objectives of Canada’s immigration policy concerning removals are to maintain and protect public \norder, health and security in Canada; \n \n \nto ensure that all the legal rights accorded to foreign nationals being removed are observed; \n \nto conduct their removal effectively and equitably; \n \nverify the removal of foreign nationals efficiently and expeditiously; \n \nensure that foreign nationals required to leave Canada actually do so; \n \nensure that foreign nationals who are the subject of enforceable removal orders leave Canada \nimmediately and that the removal order is enforced as soon as possible; and \n \nallow the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to update their records to indicate that a \ncase has been concluded and no further enforcement action is required. \n \n \n \n3 \nThe Act and Regulations \nOfficers responsible for the removal of foreign nationals from Canada should be familiar with the \nlegislative and regulatory authorities contained in IRPA and its Regulations.

Each transitional provision having an impact on the \nremovals program is outlined below. \n \nApplication of IRPA \nUnder the transitional provision of A190, every application, proceeding or matter under the former \nAct that was pending or in progress immediately before the coming into force of this section shall be \ngoverned by IRPA on that coming into force. \n \nStays \nUnder the transitional provision of A197 and despite A192, if an appellant who has been granted a \nstay under the former Act breaches a condition of that stay, the appellant shall be subject to A64 \nand A68(4). \n \nDecisions made under former Act \nUnder the transitional provision of R317(1), a decision made under the former Act that was in effect \nimmediately prior to the coming into force of IRPA continues to be in effect after that coming into \nforce. \n \nRemoval orders \nUnder the transitional provision of R319(1), a removal order made under the former Act that was \nunexecuted continues in force and is subject to the provisions of the IRPA. \n \nStay of removal \nUnder the transitional provision of R319(2) and (3), the enforcement of a removal order that had \nbeen stayed under paragraph 49(1)(c), (d), (e) and (f) of the former Act continues to be stayed \nuntil the earliest of the events described in R231(1)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e). \n \nThis provision does not apply if the subject of the removal order was determined by the Convention \nRefugee Determination Division not to have a credible basis for their claim; or the subject of the \nremoval order is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality, or resides or sojourns in the U.S. or \nSt. Pierre and Miquelon and is the subject of a report prepared under A44(1) on their entry into \nCanada. \n \nConditional removal order \nUnder the transitional provision of R319(4), a conditional removal order made under the former Act \ncontinues in force and is subject to A49(2). \n \nEnforced removal order \nUnder the transitional provision of R319(5), A52 applies to a person who was outside Canada after \na removal order had been enforced against them.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nWarrants \nUnder the transitional provision of R325(1), a warrant for the arrest and detention made under the \nformer Act is a warrant for arrest and detention made under IRPA. \n \nRemoval not prohibited \nUnder the transitional provision of R326(3), a person whose removal was allowed by the application \nof paragraph 53(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the former Act is a person referred to in A115(2). \n \nJudicial review \nUnder the transitional provision of R348(1), any application for leave to commence an application \nfor judicial review and any application for judicial review or appeal from an application that was \nbrought under the former Act and is pending or in progress before the Federal Court or the \nSupreme Court of Canada is deemed to have been commenced under Division 8 of Part 1 of IRPA \nand is governed by the provisions of that Division and section 87. \n \n \n3.2 Forms \nThe forms required are shown in the following table. \nForm Title \nForm number \nCertificate of Departure \nIMM0056B \nOrder for Detention \nBSF304 \nDetained Sticker \nBSF578 \nDenial of Authorization to Return to Canada \nIMM1202B \nAuthorization to Return to Canada \nIMM1203B \nRemoval Costs Payable by Transporter \nBSF501 \nNotice to Transporter \nBSF502 \nDirection to Leave Canada \nBSF503 \nEnvelope: Removal Documents \nBSF582 \nDirection to Return to the United States \nBSF505 \nNotice of Removal and Profile \nBSF560 \nNotice of Issuance of Permit \nIMM1443B \nRemoval Checklist and File Audit \nBSF522 \nSingle Journey Document \nIMM5149B \nWithdrawal of a Claim for Refugee Protection Prior to Referral to the  \nRefugee Protection Division \nIMM 5317B \nCriminality \nBSF571 \nUse of Force Incident Report \nBSF586\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \n4 \nInstruments and delegations  \nRecognizing their respective mandates, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada \n(IRCC) and the Public Safety (PS) Minister may designate persons or class of persons as officers to \ncarry out any purpose of any provision of IRPA; delegate their powers and functions under IRPA, \nunless otherwise provided. \nWhile the PS Minister and the CBSA has the policy lead for enforcement with respect to IRPA, IRCC \ncontinues to be responsible for screening applicants for inadmissibility and for acting on that \nresponsibility, according to their delegated authority. \nPursuant to A6(1) and A6(2), the Minister [IRCC or PS] has designated persons or class of persons as \nofficers to carry out any purpose of any provision, legislative or regulatory, and has specified the \npowers and duties of the officers so designated. Refer to the Designation of Officers and Delegation of \nAuthority documents in IL 3 for more details. \n \n5 \nProcedure: Office responsibilities for removal \n \n5.1 Responsibilities of an inland CBSA removals office \nInland Enforcement officers are responsible for making removal arrangements for: \n \npersons ordered removed by the Immigration Division; \n \n \npersons ordered removed by a Minister’s delegate; and \n \n \npersons ordered removed at a POE but could not be removed by the POE. \n \n \n5.2 Responsibility for POE cases \nBorder Services Officers (BSO) are responsible for making removal arrangements for cases where the \nperson is issued a removal order and the removal order can be enforced immediately (e.g. denied \nentry into Canada, can be removed on the next available flight, etc). \nFor all other cases where a removal order has been issued at a POE to persons who cannot be \nremoved immediately, BSOs must transfer the file as soon as possible to their nearest Inland \nEnforcement removal office. The file should be accompanied with a summary of the case and the \nreason why the file is being transferred. \n \n \n6  \nDefinitions \n \nActionable \nActionable is defined as cases that are PRRA-barred and \nno stays, impediments, or active immigration warrants \nexist. \n \nAccompaniment Escort \nOccurs when management has identified that there is no \nrisk, but due to airline, in-transit or foreign rules there is \na requirement for an officer presence. This is for \nfacilitation purposes only.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nAuthorization to return to Canada \n(ARC) \nWritten authorization by an officer, in prescribed \ncircumstances, to allow a person to return to Canada \nafter their removal order has been enforced. \n \nCertificate of Departure \nThis document confirms that the person named on the \nremoval order has appeared before an officer at the POE \nto verify their departure, that they have departed from \nCanada, and have been authorized to enter their country \nof destination. This document also confirms the \nenforcement of a removal order outside Canada or the \nenforcement of the removal order in Canada when the \nofficer confirms that the foreign national has departed \nfrom Canada.  \n \nEnforceable removal order \n \nA removal order that has come into force and is not \nstayed. \n \nEnforced removal order \nA removal order is enforced only after the requirements \nof R240(1), R240(2), or R240(3) have been met. \n \nEscorts \nWhen it has been determined that an enforcement \npresence is required when the individual under a removal \norder is being transported, accompanied or escorted due \nto risk. \n \nGender-based violence (GBV) \nViolence committed against someone based on their \ngender, gender expression, gender identity or perceived \ngender, and is a violation of human rights. It takes many \nforms, including physical, economic, sexual, as well as \nemotional (psychological) abuse.  \n \nForeign national \nA person who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent \nresident, including a stateless person. \n \nPermanent resident \nA person who has acquired permanent resident \nstatus and has not subsequently lost that status \nunder A46. \n \nPre-Removal Risk Assessment \n(PRRA) \nA process which assesses risk prior to the removal of a \nperson who is eligible to apply for a PRRA. \nPreviously deported person (PDP) \nA person whose deportation order has been enforced and \nrequires authorization to return to Canada by an officer \npursuant to A52(1). \n \nRemoval by the Minister \nThe PS Minister must enforce a removal order where the \nforeign national does not or cannot avail themselves of \nenforcement by voluntary compliance, a negative \ndetermination is made under R238(1), or the foreign \nnational’s choice of destination is not approved under \nR238(2).\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \nRemoval order comes into force \nA removal order made with respect to a person who is \nnot a refugee protection claimant comes into force on the \nlatest of the dates set out in A49(1). With respect to a \nperson who has made a claim for refugee protection, the \nremoval order is conditional and comes into force on the \nlatest of the dates set out in A49(2). \n \nRisk-based Escort \nWhen an enforcement officer travels outside Canada to \neffect a removal where management has determined \nthat sufficient risk exists to justify it. \n \nStay of removal \nThe PS Minister cannot remove a person from Canada in \ncircumstances where IRPA or the Regulations specify \nthat the removal is prohibited, or where there is a valid \ncourt order prohibiting the person’s removal. \n \nTransport Escort \nOccurs when an individual under a removal order is \nbeing: \n \n \ntransported from one location to another within \nCanada; \n \ntransported to the last departure point in Canada; \n \ntransferred by land to the United States POE. \n \nSecurity guards contracted by the CBSA will do \nthis work where services are available. \n \n \nUnenforced removal order \nA removal order that has not been enforced in \naccordance with IRPA and the Regulations. \n \nVoluntary compliance \nA person who is not a danger to the public, a fugitive \nfrom justice in Canada or another country, or seeking to \nevade or frustrate the cause of justice in Canada or \nanother country may voluntarily comply with a removal \norder before an officer and satisfy the officer that the \nrequirements of R238(1)(a) and (b) and R238(2) have \nbeen met. The foreign national must be in a position to \nobtain their own travel documents and pay for all \nremoval arrangements.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \n7 \nProcedure: Information Management \n \n7.1 Removals Wiki \nOfficers should regularly visit the Removals Wiki site developed and updated by the Removals \nProgram Management Unit at NHQ.  \n \nThis site provides assistance and instructions to officers performing removal functions and includes: \n \ncurrent policy instructions; \n \nthe list of countries to which removal has been temporarily suspended; \n \nremoval statistics; \n \noperational updates \n \nother useful links for other governments or agencies in Canada and abroad. \n \n7.2 \nRetaining and Filing Information \nAll records, documents, officer notes, and correspondence including electronic sources of \ninformation, regardless of medium or format, such as emails and instant messages that pertain to a \nforeign national’s removal must be added to the foreign national’s file and retained as outlined in \nthe Program, Policy and Operational Direction – Retention and Disposition Schedule and guided by \nthe CBSA’s Enterprise Information Management Division. \n \nThe CBSA Program Policy and Operational Direction Retention Schedule provides: \n \ndescriptions of records created, used and received at the Agency; \n \nstandards for how long each record series should be kept; \n \ndirection on how to dispose of records when retention periods are complete; \n \nlinks to applicable legislation, corporate policies and industry guidelines; \n \ninventory of personal information banks held by the Agency. \n \nThe records retention schedule applies equally to paper and electronic records as well as structured \ndatabases. \nCase files other than A34, A35, A36(1) and A37 of IRPA must be retained for 10 years after one of \nthe following conditions is met: departure of foreign national has been confirmed, person concerned \nbecomes Canadian citizen, person concerned is removed under the Extradition Act, Convention \nRefugee status has been ceased/vacated. \nSerious case files relating to persons known or suspected of engaging in activities contrary to \nsections A34, A35, A36(1) and A37of IRPA should continue to be retained for 65 years or until the \nforeign national reaches 120 years of age after one of the following conditions is met: departure of \nforeign national has been confirmed, person concerned becomes Canadian citizen, person \nconcerned is removed under the Extradition Act, Convention Refugee status has been \nceased/vacated. Once this period has elapsed, the serious case files must be transferred to Library \nand Archives Canada and cannot be destroyed.  \nMore information can be found in the Program, Policy and Operational Direction – Retention and \nDisposition Schedule accessible on CBSA Atlas.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nPART II – Removal Program \n \n8 \nProcedure: Removal Priorities \nConsistent with CBSA priorities, the removals program focuses on cases that pose the greatest  \nrisk to the safety and security of Canadians and ensuring the integrity of Canada’s immigration \nprogram. In this regard, while all removals are to occur as soon as possible, specific cases are \nconsidered a greater priority. Below are the three tiers of case priority with corresponding IRPA \nsections:  \n \n \nTier One – Safety and Security grounds, specifically, foreign nationals inadmissible for \nsecurity (s. 34); international or human rights violations (s. 35); criminality (s. 36); and \norganized crime (s.37). Failed refugee claimants (s.41(a)), who entered Canada between \nofficial POEs (irregular migrants) are also considered tier one due to their impact on the \nasylum system; \n \n \nTier Two – Regular failed refugee claimants (s.41(a)), who entered Canada through a \ndesignated POE; and \n \n \nTier Three – All other inadmissibilities. \n \nIt should be noted that all removal cases are a priority, but an officer’s efforts should first be \ndirected to cases in tier one. Note, a detained case in any of the three tiers will always be \nconsidered a tier one priority. \n \n9  Vulnerable Persons  \n \nIt is an overall goal of Canada’s immigration program to treat all persons with dignity and respect. In \nexercising their IRPA authorities, officials must approach all cases in a nonjudgmental manner, remain \nsensitive to the potential needs and limitations of vulnerable persons, and recognize that a person they \nare dealing with may have experienced some form of violence, abuse or trauma.  \nWhen making removal arrangements, officers need to be sensitive to the fact that a person they \nencounter may have been subjected to specific violence, trauma, or abuse based solely on the \ngender, perceived gender, gender identity or gender expression, as well as sexual \norientation. This is referred to as gender-based violence (GBV), which is a human rights violation.  \nIt is important to note that GBV can take many forms, including physical, economic, sexual, as well as \nemotional (psychological) abuse.  \nOfficers should be aware that certain individuals face a greater risk of experiencing GBV including: \nwomen, girls, 2SLGBTQI+ people and people living with disabilities. Moreover, the risk of GBV may be \nincreased with the intersection of any two or more of these characteristics.  \nIn the context of removals, vulnerable persons may include, but are not limited to: \n \nminors (under 18 years of age), including unaccompanied minors; \n \nelderly persons; \n \nindividuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities;  \n \npersons with a suspected or known mental illness;\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \n \npersons who have suffered traumatic experiences that resulted in some degree of \nvulnerability, including: \no \npersons who may face hardship for sexual or gender based reasons or who may \nbe victims or survivors of gender-based violence. victims/suspected victims of \ntrafficking in persons (VTIPs) or family violence. \nDepending on their cultural background, victims of GBV may be reluctant to disclose their experiences in order to \nnot “shame” their families or communities.  \n \nIn the context of removals, victims and survivors of GBV may be encountered both at the port of entry or inland. \nIn such cases, officers should be alert to such cases and will ensure to the extent possible that accommodations \nare made during removal arrangements (e.g., for female victims, have a female officer either conduct or be \npresent during an interview, and arrange, if possible, for a female interpreter).  \n \nFor further resources on GBV, please refer to the Government of Canada’s Gender Based Violence Knowledge \nCentre (Canada.ca).  \n \nNote: Officers should keep in mind that there are specific policy guidelines in place for vulnerable \nindividuals without status that may be victims of family violence. If a foreign national is in Canada, \ncurrently seeking permanent residence, which is contingent on upon remaining in a genuine \nrelationship with the suspected abusive partner or spouse, the CBSA will work with IRCC to ensure \nthe person is processed under the GBV guidelines. \nFor more information, refer to the Removals Wiki Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) for victims of \nfamily violence.  \n \n10  Procedure: Authority to remove from Canada \n \n10.1 Types of removal orders \nIRPR s.223 describes the three types of removal orders that can be issued to persons who are found \ninadmissible under the IRPA: \n \n1. Departure orders  \nDeparture orders are issued primarily to refugee claimants. For additional information on when a \nconditional departure order comes into force see section 9.3. \nForeign nationals who are issued departure orders must confirm their departure from Canada \nwithin 30 days after the order becomes enforceable. If the foreign national does not depart \nCanada within that period, the order automatically becomes a deportation order (deemed \ndeportation). This will affect the person’s requirements to return to Canada. If the removal order \nis enforced as a departure order that has become a deportation order, the foreign national will \nrequire an Authorization to Return to Canada by an officer [A52(1)]. \nThe foreign national must be counselled on the requirements of R240(1)(a), (b) and (c) and \npresent themselves before an officer at a POE. Failure to meet these requirements will result in \nthe departure order becoming a deportation order under R224(2). Departure orders that have \nbeen enforced at a POE within the 30-day applicable period under R224(1) do not require a \nforeign national to obtain authorization to return to Canada under A52(1).\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nCalculation of the applicable period for departure orders \nFor persons issued departure orders who remain in Canada under an unenforced removal order, \nofficers must, when verifying departure, consider and calculate the 30-day period. In calculating the \napplicable period for departure orders, officers must determine if there are any statutory or \nregulatory stays of removal or whether the person is detained under IRPA during the 30-day \napplicable period. Either of these circumstances will have the effect of “stopping the clock” and \nsuspending the 30-day period. \n \nTo ensure that the applicable 30-day period is applied consistently, officers must become familiar \nwith the calculation periods and be aware that the applicable period is suspended when: \n \n \nthe removal order against the person is stayed; or \n \nthe person is detained under IRPA. \n \nUnder R224(3), the 30-day applicable period is suspended until the foreign national’s release or when \nthe stay is lifted. The applicable period resumes the day following the release or the removal of the \nstay. The number of days during the applicable period before the detention or stay is then subtracted \nfrom the time remaining in the original 30-day applicable period. \n \nCalculation of the applicable period for detained persons on a \ndeparture order \nIn cases where a foreign national is the subject of a departure order and has been detained in \nCanada, the 30-day applicable period is suspended under R224(3) until the foreign national’s \nrelease from detention. Once the foreign national is released, the remaining time, if any, resumes \nthe day following the person’s release. \nIt is very important that the GCMS/NCMS systems are updated when a person is detained or \nreleased under IRPA. \nExample: Detained on a departure order within the 30-day applicable period: A departure order \nbecomes enforceable on August 6, 2013. The foreign national is detained under IRPA on August 23, \n2013. The foreign national is then released from detention on September 2, 2013. From August 6, \n2013 to August 23, 2013, there are 17 days that are counted against the departure order. The clock \nresumes on September 3, 2013, and the foreign national has 13 days remaining to depart Canada \nand enforce the departure order. The detention period is not calculated as part of the 30-day \napplicable period. The foreign national should yield to the departure order by September 15, 2013, \nin order to avoid a deportation order. \nExample: Detained on a departure order within the 30-day applicable period: A departure order \nbecomes enforceable on July 1, 2013. The foreign national is detained under IRPA on July 10, 2013. \nThe foreign national is released from detention on August 31, 2013. Even though the foreign \nnational was detained for a period of more than 30 days, the person is not considered to be under a \ndeportation order. From July 1, 2013 to July 10, 2013, there are nine days that are counted against \nthe departure order. The clock resumes on September 1, 2013, which is day 10 of the applicable \nperiod. The foreign national has 20 days to depart from Canada before the departure order \nbecomes a deportation order. \nWhen departure is verified, it is very important for officers to accurately indicate on the IMM0056B \nand in GCMS/NCMS whether the removal order is a departure or deportation order.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nCalculation of the applicable period for a stayed departure order \nIf a foreign national is the subject of a departure order that is stayed, the officer must consider \nwhether the person is on a valid stay or whether the stay has been lifted. If the stay has been \nlifted, the officer must calculate the 30-day applicable period, during the time there was no stay of \nremoval in effect. If this calculation shows that the person's time in Canada exceeds 30 days, the \norder becomes a deportation order. If the time period is within the 30-day applicable period, the \norder remains a departure order. \nExample: Stay of departure order: A departure order becomes enforceable on January 2, 2015. The \ndeparture order is stayed on January 8, 2015. The stay is lifted on March 21, 2015. From January 2, \n2015 to January 8, 2015, there are six days that are counted against the departure order. From \nJanuary 8 to March 21, 2015, there are 72 days where the removal was stayed. This period is not \ncalculated as part of the 30-day applicable period. The clock resumes on March 22, 2015, and the \nforeign national has 24 days remaining from this date to depart Canada and enforce their departure \norder. The departure order must be enforced by April 14, 2015, in order to avoid a deportation \norder against the foreign national. \nWhen departure is verified, it is very important for officers to accurately indicate on the IMM0056  \nand in GCMS/NCMS whether the removal order is a departure or deportation order. \n \n2. Exclusion orders \nExclusion orders are issued primarily for less serious immigration violations. \nExclusion orders with a one-year ban under R225(1) require a foreign national to obtain \nauthorization to return to Canada under A52(1) if they wish to return within one year after their \nremoval order was enforced. \nExclusion orders with a five-year ban under R225(2) require a foreign national to obtain \nauthorization to return to Canada under A52(1) if they wish to return within five years after their \nremoval order was enforced. \n \n3. Deportation orders \nDeportation orders are issued primarily for more serious immigration violations. \nDeportation orders permanently bar a person from returning to Canada. Under R226(1), all persons \nwho are the subject of an enforced deportation order always require authorization to return to \nCanada under A52(1). A departure order becomes a deportation order, through operation of law, \nunder R224(2) if the foreign national does not meet the requirements to enforce their removal \norder under R240(1)(a), (b) and (c) within 30 days after the order becomes enforceable.  \n \nRequirement to return for accompanying family members  \nForeign nationals included in removal orders (exclusion or deportation orders) that have been made \non the basis that the person is an accompanying family member under A42(b) will not require \nauthorization to return to Canada under A52(1). Officers should counsel these persons accordingly \npursuant to R225(4) and R226(2). \nThe files of persons removed under A42(b) must not be downloaded into the previously deported \nperson database and will not be placed in CPIC.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n10.2  When a removal order comes into force – non-    \n     refugee protection claimant \nUnder A49(1), a removal order for a non-refugee protection claimant will come into force on the \nlatest of the following dates: \n \nthe day the removal order is made, if there is no right to appeal [A49(1)(a)]; \n \nthe day the appeal period expires, if there is a right to appeal and no appeal is made \n[A49(1)(b)]; or \n \nthe day of the final determination of the appeal, if an appeal is made [A49(1)(c)]. \n \n \n10.3  When a removal order comes into force – refugee  \n         protection claimant \nWith respect to a refugee protection claimant, the removal order does not come into force under \nA49(2) until specific events have passed. At the time the removal order is made, it is not in force \nand is conditional until it comes into force on the latest of the following dates: \n \nthe day the claim is determined to be ineligible under A101(1)(e) if the claimant came \ndirectly or indirectly to Canada from a country designated by the Regulations, other than a \ncountry of their nationality or former habitual residence [A49(2)(a)]; \n \nin all cases other than A101(1)(e), seven days after the claim is determined to be ineligible \n[A49(2)(b)]; or \n \n15 days after notification that the claim has been rejected by the Refugee Protection \nDivision (RPD) if no appeal is made, or by the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) if an appeal is \nmade [A49(2)(c)]; \n \n15 days after notification that the claim is declared withdrawn or abandoned [A49(2)(d)] by \neither the RPD or RAD; or \n \n15 days after proceedings have been terminated as a result of a notice that the claim was \nbased on misrepresentation under A104(1)(c) or the claim was not the first one made by \nthe claimant under A104(1)(d) [A49(2)(e)]. \n \nFor the purposes of A49(2)(c) and A49(2)(d), the Refugee Protection Division Rules and Refugee \nAppeal Division Rules define when a decision is considered to be received, and whether that \ndecision is given in person or made in writing. After a decision takes effect, there is a 15-day period \nunder A49(2)(c) and A49(2)(d) for the removal order to come into force. \nEither party may withdraw a claim or an application to vacate or to cease refugee protection by one \nof the two methods below, depending on the status of the application. \n \n1.   No substantive evidence accepted by the RPD: \nWithdrawal of a claim or application may occur under RPD rule 59(2) if the claimant informs the RPD \norally or in writing that they no longer want to continue their claim. In these cases, substantive \nevidence must not have been accepted at the RPD proceeding. If no evidence has been submitted, \nthe Registrar of the RPD may withdraw the claim, usually on the day the person requests to \nwithdraw. When the claim is withdrawn, the Registrar of the RPD will complete form RPD.12 \n“Notification confirming the withdrawal of a claim for refugee protection [rule 59(2)]“ and notify the \nparties.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \n2.   Substantive evidence accepted by the RPD: \nWhen a claim or application for refugee protection is withdrawn under RPD rule 59(3) and \nsubstantive evidence has been submitted to the RPD, the person must make an application to the \nRPD to withdraw their claim. A hearing is conducted, either orally or in writing, and the RPD \nmember(s) will make a decision on the application. If the application is granted, the RPD Registrar \nwill complete form RPD12.3 “Notice of decision Application to withdraw [rule 59(3)]” and notify both \nthe claimant and the CBSA that the claim is withdrawn. \n \n \n  \nDecisions delivered by regular mail \nThe RPD and RAD Rules provide the timelines for determining when a decision is considered to be \nreceived if it was delivered by regular mail. For A49(2)(c) and A49(2)(d) cases only, a document that \nis delivered by regular mail to a party in the proceeding is considered to be received seven days after \nthe day it was mailed. If the seventh day is a Saturday, Sunday or other statutory holiday, the \ndocument is considered to be received on the next working day [RPD rules 41(2) and 41(3); and RAD \nrules 35(2) and 35(3)]. \nFor the purposes of the RPD Rules, a decision is provided through a notice of decision [RPD rule \n67(1)] and is considered to be a document under RPD rule 31. Similarly, for the RAD, a decision is \nprovided through a notice of decision [RAD rule 50(1)] and is considered a document under RAD rule \n27. Notification under A49(2)(c) and A49(2)(d) is the delivery date of a notice of decision. \nFor the purpose of the RPD and RAD Rules, regular mail does not include decisions that are delivered \nby a means other than the Canada Post regular standard mail service. In cases where a decision is \ndelivered by means other than regular mail (i.e., fax, courier service, e-mail), the decision takes \neffect when the person receives the decision. For these cases, proof of service will establish the date \non which the decision was received. \nExample: Calculation of the notification period for a decision sent by mail \nAn appeal of a negative RPD claim was rejected by the RAD on July 31, 2015, and the decision was \nmailed on the same day using a regular mailing service provided by Canada Post. The seven-day \ncalculation period for the delivery of the decision begins on August 1 and ends on August 7. As the \nappeal of the negative claim was rejected by the RAD, the removal order will come into force on \nAugust 22, 2015, which is 15 days after the person was notified of the decision. If there is no stay of \nremoval, a departure order comes into force and the person must depart Canada within 30 days. If \nthe refugee claimant was issued an exclusion or deportation order and if there is no stay of removal, \nthe removal order would become enforceable and the person must leave Canada immediately [A48]. \nThere is a simple way to calculate the notification period for the majority of decisions sent by regular \nmail: there is a seven-day mailing period plus a 15-day period before the removal order comes into \nforce. This equals 22 days from the date of mailing of a decision for the removal order to come into \nforce. It is important to remember that in cases where the seventh day falls on a statutory holiday, \nthe calculation of time for when the removal order will come into force must be adjusted accordingly. \n \nDecisions delivered in person \nWhen a decision is made at an RPD or RAD hearing, the decision takes effect when the Division \nmember or a three-member panel states the decision orally and, if applicable, gives reasons for the \ndecision.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \nDecisions made in writing \nWhen a decision is made by the RPD or RAD in writing, it will take effect when the Division member \nor a three-member panel signs and dates the reasons for the decision. \n \n10.4  When a removal order becomes enforceable \nA removal order is enforceable under A48(1) after the removal order has come into force and is not \nstayed. If a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national must leave Canada immediately and \nthe order must be enforced as soon as possible. \n \n10.5  When a removal order is actionable  \nActionable is defined as cases where the pre-removal risk assessment has been completed, if eligible, \nand no stays, impediments, or active immigration warrants exist. It is incumbent upon each CBSA \nremoval officer to ensure these cases are removed as soon as possible in coordination with the \npriorities for removal (see section 8). \n \n \n10.6   Removal orders no longer enforceable –     \n          Pardons/Acquittals on appeal \nIf a Canadian criminal conviction is pardoned or acquitted on appeal, a removal order based solely on \nthat conviction must not subsequently be enforced. If the pardon or acquittal is later revoked or \noverturned pursuant to the Criminal Records Act, the removal order may become enforceable again. \nThere will be some cases where the inadmissibility report contained more than one allegation or \nthere was more than one conviction. It may be necessary to review the transcript of the admissibility \nhearing to determine which allegations formed the basis of the removal order. If there was a finding \nof inadmissibility for any other allegation, or for other convictions which have not been pardoned or \nacquitted, the removal order remains enforceable. The order becomes unenforceable only if all of the \nconvictions reflected in the removal order have been pardoned or acquitted. \nThe pardon or acquittal does not have the effect of erasing the deportation order from the record or \nrendering it invalid. If the pardon is revoked or ceases to have effect, the removal order will become \nenforceable again as a result. A pardon is prospective: the intent is to eliminate any negative \nconsequences of the conviction after the time of the pardon. However, it does not erase the \nconviction or any resulting consequences that occurred before the pardon was granted. \nThis policy reflects the jurisprudence in Smith v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) \n(1998), a valid deportation or exclusion order may not be enforced after a pardon has been granted \nfor the offence in question, the conviction has been revoked under the Criminal Records Act, or there \nhas been a final determination of an acquittal. \n \nFormer Permanent Residents \nIf the removal order was issued against a permanent resident, then the person lost that status under \nsection 46(1)(c) on the day the removal order came into force. Following a pardon or acquittal, there \nis no provision in IRPA for the person to regain permanent resident status, despite the removal order \nbecoming unenforceable. The person remains a foreign national and may reapply for permanent \nresidence in the normal manner. The valid removal order is simply deferred until permanent \nresidence is granted. Although the person may no longer be inadmissible, it does not change the fact \nthat they were inadmissible at the time the removal order was issued. Therefore, their permanent \nresidence status was lost.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \nOfficers should prepare a letter to the person outlining that: \nAs a result of a pardon/acquittal on [insert date of pardon/acquittal] at [Correctional Services Canada \nor court and location of acquittal] of a conviction of [insert offence name and section number of the \noffence], the [insert type of removal order and document number] issued on [insert date of removal \norder issuance] will not be enforced. On the day that your removal order came into force, your status \nbecame that of a foreign national. You may obtain an application for permanent residence by \naccessing the IRCC Web site at www.cic.gc.ca, or by contacting the Call Centre at 1-888-242-2100. \nPlease note that any further evidence of inadmissibility, including any future convictions, could result \nin enforcement action. \n \nUpdating NCMS and GCMS  \nAfter court records have been reviewed to confirm the pardon or acquittal, the case should be closed \nin GCMS with remarks specifying which convictions have been pardoned or acquitted and that the \nremoval order is not enforceable. This information will assist with any future encounters with the \nindividual by the CBSA. \nThe removal order disposition in GCMS should be left at “IN FORCE.” A pardon or acquittal is not a \nfinding that the removal order was issued in error or that the removal order is quashed. If the pardon \nor acquittal is subsequently revoked or overturned, the removal order becomes enforceable and \nremoval procedures can resume. \nIn NCMS, the removal process should be “Terminated,” with notes to indicate which specific \nconvictions have been pardoned or acquitted and that the removal order is not enforceable at this \ntime. \nIn the event that a person applies for permanent resident status after the pardon or acquittal is \ngranted, the removal process stage in NCMS should indicate “Pending Landing.” Should the person \nreceive permanent resident status, the removal process stage in NCMS should indicate \"PC Landed.” \nThis disposition will conclude the Removal process. \nNote: Please refer to OP 1, section 6 for instructions on procedures regarding pardons or acquittals \nafter a removal order has been enforced. \n \n11 Procedure: Statutory and Regulatory Stays \nA48(2) imposes an obligation such that if the removal order is enforceable, the foreign national \nagainst whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as \npossible. \nStatutory and regulatory stays of removal are outlined in A50, and R230 to R234. The courts may \nalso impose stays of removal in individual cases. IRPA has made provision for such stays in A50(a), \nwhere removal cannot contravene a judicial order, and in A50(c), concerning a stay imposed by a \ncourt of competent jurisdiction. An undertaking given on behalf of the PS Minister during the course \nof litigation also constitutes a stay of removal. \nIn some cases, the enforcement of removal orders can be stayed through the statutory and \nregulatory provisions of IRPA and its Regulations as well as through court-ordered stays. When a stay \nof removal is applied, through operation of law, the stay renders the removal order not enforceable \nunder A48(1), and the CBSA must postpone removal. As a result, the person must not be removed \nfrom Canada until they are subject to a removal order that has come into force and is not stayed.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nIt is essential for the GCMS and/or NCMS systems to be updated when a stay of removal is in place \nand when it is lifted. Accurate information is paramount to ensuring that a person who is the subject \nof a stayed removal order is not removed. \nThere will be occasions when an officer will be uncertain whether a stay of removal applies in a \nspecific removal case. Should this situation arise, officers should consult their supervisor for direction. \nIf the issue is complex, the supervisor may refer the officer to a regional program specialist or \nregional Justice Liaison Officer (JLO) as the case may be. Sometimes, these contacts can bring other \nissues to an officer's attention that may have been overlooked. \nThe following charts should assist officers in determining when a stay of removal may be appropriate \nand when stay provisions do not apply, and any exceptions that may be associated with the \nstatutory, regulatory or court-ordered stays. \n \n11.1  Statutory stays of removal \nA50 contains provisions to stay the removal of foreign nationals who have been issued a removal order. \nWhen a statutory stay is imposed under IRPA, the removal order is not enforceable. \nAuthority When a stay applies \nWhen a stay does not apply \nA50(a) \nDecision at a judicial proceeding \ndirectly contravenes the enforcement of \na removal order, and the PS Minister is \ngiven the opportunity to make \nsubmissions \nA stay of removal applies if a decision made \nin a judicial proceeding would be directly \ncontravened by the enforcement of a removal \norder. This stay applies where the PS Minister \nwas given the opportunity to make \nsubmissions. \nFor guidelines and scenarios in which an \nA50(a) stay of removal applies, refer to \nsection 12. \n \nFor guidelines and scenarios in which an \nA50(a) stay is not applicable, refer to \nsection 12. \nA50(b) \nImprisonment in Canada \nA stay of removal applies when a  \nforeign national is sentenced to a term  \nof imprisonment in Canada. \nOfficers must not enforce a removal  \norder if the foreign national is an  \ninmate of a penitentiary, jail,  \nreformatory or prison. \nThe stay of removal is effective until the \nsentence being served is completed. \nThe sentence is completed when the  \nforeign national is released from \nimprisonment by reason of expiration of \nsentence, commencement of statutory \nrelease or grant of parole. Unless the  \nparole is suspended, terminated or  \nrevoked, the removal can take place. \n \nA conditional sentence order served \noutside a prison is not considered a term \nof imprisonment under paragraph 36(1)(a) \nof IRPA. A foreign national serving a \nconditional sentence order does not \nbenefit from a stay of removal.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \nA50(c) \nStay of removal granted by the \nImmigration Appeal Division (IAD) \nA removal order is stayed under  \nA66(b) and A68 until the stay is  \nno longer in force. \nThere is no stay of removal when: \n \n \na permanent resident or foreign \nnational who is on a stay of an appeal \nagainst an inadmissibility finding under \nA36(1) or A36(2) is subsequently \nconvicted of another offence under \nA36(1) and the stay is cancelled; \n \nthe appeal is dismissed; or \n \nthe IAD may, on application or on its \nown initiative, reconsider the appeal \nand lift the stay of removal. \nA50(c) \nStay of removal by any other court of \ncompetent jurisdiction \nA removal is stayed if the Federal Court or \nthe Supreme Court of Canada issues an order \nto stay the enforcement of a removal order \nor to bar the PS Minister from carrying out \nthe removal order.  \nThe stay order will be in effect until the \nconditions specified in the order are satisfied. \nIf the provincial court issues  \nan injunction or a stay to prevent removal, \nremoval may be stayed pursuant to A50(a) \nand possibly A50(c). The stay will be in effect \nuntil the conditions of the stay order are \nsatisfied or the order is rescinded.  \nFor more information on applications  \nfor stays, court-imposed stays and \nundertakings not to remove, refer to  \nENF 9, section 4 and section 5. \nAn application for a stay of removal does \nnot trigger or constitute a stay of removal. \nA50(d) \nDuration of stay under A114(1) \nThere is a stay of removal when there  \nis a positive decision to allow the  \nprotection of a person described in A112(3). \n \nThese persons are: \n \n \ninadmissible on grounds of security, \nviolating human rights or international \nrights, or organized criminality; \n \ninadmissible on grounds of serious \ncriminality punished by a term of \nimprisonment of at least two years; \n \nrefugee claimants rejected on the basis of \nsection F of Article 1 of the Refugee \nConvention; or \n \npersons named in an A77 certificate. \nA stay of removal is cancelled if the \nMinister of IRCC re-examines the case and \ndetermines that the circumstances under \nwhich the application was allowed have \nchanged and dismisses the application.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30 \n \nA50(e) \nDuration of stay imposed by the Minister \nThis provision could include discretionary \nstays where the PS Minister imposes the stay \nof removal. These stays will be determined \non a case-by-case basis and will be assessed \nby NHQ in accordance with the instruments \nof delegation. \nIn addition, A50(e) provides for the authority \nof the PS Minister to impose a stay of \nremoval for temporary suspension under \nR230 where the country or place presents a \ngeneralized risk.  \nFor more information on R230,  \nrefer to section 10.2 below. \n \n11.2  Regulatory stays of removal \nIn addition to the stays provided for in A50, A53(d) provides authority for the Regulations to stay \na removal order. When the Regulations provide for a stay of removal of foreign nationals, the \nremoval order cannot be enforced. \n \nAuthority \nWhen a stay applies \nWhen a stay does not apply \nR230 \nTemporary suspension of removals \n(TSR) and administrative deferral \nof removals (ADR) \nA TSR or ADR will be imposed where return \nto a specific country or place presents a \ngeneralized risk that the PS Minister \nconsiders dangerous and unsafe to the \nentire general civilian population  \nof that country or place. \nThe PS Minister will make the decision by a \nformal process. When a decision is made \nto suspend removals to a particular \ncountry, this decision will be announced to \nall offices. \nFor a list of the countries under a TSR or \nADR refer to: \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/security- \nsecurite/rem-ren- \neng.html?wbdisable=true \n \nNote: Generalized risk is different from \nIndividualized risk assessed during \nImmigration and Refugee Board (IRB), \nH&C, and PRRA assessments.  \nSection 13.3 describes the differences \nbetween the two. \nThe stay of removal under this provision \ndoes not apply to classes of persons who: \n \n \nhave been found inadmissible on \ngrounds of security under A34(1); \n \nhave been found inadmissible on \ngrounds of human or international \nrights violations under A35(1); \n \nhave been found inadmissible on \ngrounds of serious criminality under \nA36(1) or on grounds of criminality \nunder A36(2); \n \nhave been found inadmissible on \ngrounds of organized crime under \nA37(1); or \n \nhave been excluded by the Refugee \nProtection Division by reason of \nsection F, Article 1 of the Refugee \nConvention. \n \nwish to return to their country of risk \nand inform the Minister in writing that \nthey consent to their removal. \n \nUnder R230(2), the PS Minister may \ncancel the stay if the circumstances of \ngeneralized risk to a specific country or \nplace no longer pose a risk to the entire \ncivilian population of that country or \nplace.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \n \nR231 \nJudicial review of a Refugee  \nAppeal Division decision \nA stay of removal will occur when a \nperson files an application for leave to \ncommence judicial review of a decision \nof the Refugee Appeal Division.  \nThe stay of removal will continue  \nto apply until leave is granted and \nuntil the court of last resort  \nhas disposed of the judicial review \nproceeding, if applicable. \nThe removal is stayed when the \nperson or their counsel presents an \nofficer with a certified copy of an \napplication for leave to commence \njudicial review of a RAD decision or \nwhen the officer is so advised  \nby the Department of Justice. \nThis stay pursuant to R231 will \nnormally be reflected in the GCMS \nlitigation (LIT) screen as a stay \nrequired by the Act/Regs. \nThe stay provision does not apply to \nclasses of persons who: \n \n \nis a designated foreign national; \n \nare the subject of a removal order \nbecause they are inadmissible on \ngrounds of serious criminality under \nA36(1); \n \nreside or sojourn in the United States \nor St. Pierre and Miquelon and are \nthe subject of a report under A44(1) \nat the POE only; or \n \nhave filed an application for an \nextension of time to file a leave \napplication. \n \nThe stay of removal is effective until the \nearliest of the following: \n \n \nthe application for leave is refused; \n \nthe application for leave is granted, \nthe application for judicial review is \nrefused and no question is certified \nfor the Federal Court of Appeal; \n \na question is certified by the Federal \nCourt and the appeal is not filed \nwithin the time limit;

\n \nan application for leave to appeal a \ndecision of the Federal Court of \nAppeal to the SCC is made, and the \napplication is refused; or \n \nthe application to the SCC is \ngranted, but the appeal is not filed \nwithin the time limit or the SCC \ndismisses the appeal. \n \nFor further information on judicial \nreview processes, refer to ENF 9.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nR232 \nPRRA \nA stay of removal applies when an \nofficer notifies a person that they are \neligible to make an application for \nprotection under A112(1) of the Act \nfor the PRRA program. \nA person is notified that they can \nmake an application for PRRA when: \n \n \nan officer provides the person \nwith a PRRA application form in \nperson; or  \n \nseven days have elapsed since \nthe application form was mailed \nto the person at the last address \nthey provided to the CBSA. \n \nIn order for the stay of removal to \ncontinue, an application for protection \nmust be received by IRCC within 15 \ndays after the notification is given \npursuant to R162. \nThe stay of removal is effective until the \nearliest of the following dates: \n \n \nwhen an officer receives written \nconfirmation from the person that \nthey do not intend to make an \napplication; \n \n \nthe person does not make an \napplication within 15 days after \nbeing notified; \n \n \na negative decision of the application \nhas been made; or \n \n \na person receives a positive PRRA \ndecision and receives permanent \nresident status or their application for \npermanent resident status is refused. \n \nSubsequent PRRAs will not benefit from a \nstay.  \nNote: This applies to cases where the \nPRRA was previously declared withdrawn \nor abandoned. \n \nPRRA applications filed at the POE will not \nresult in a stay of the removal. \n \n \nR233 \nH&C or public policy considerations \nA stay of removal occurs when the \ngrounds for H&C considerations on an \napplication for permanent residency \nhave been approved in principle. \nNote: Public policy considerations are \nan element of immigration policy. \nPublic policy may be included in the \nconsideration of exceptional cases. \nThere is no stay of removal where: \n \n \nthere is only an intention to apply \nfor H&C; or \n \n \nthere is an outstanding H&C \napplication that has not been \napproved in principle by the IRCC \nMinister. \n \nThe stay of removal is effective until the \nperson is granted, or refused, permanent \nresident status.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \n12 Procedure: Application of A50(a) stays of removal \n \n12.1  Overview of A50(a) stays of removal \nA50(a) will affect whether the CBSA can enforce removal orders where there are other judicial \nproceedings pending against a person subject to a removal order. A50(a) was not enacted to \nextend a benefit to persons who may be subject to probation orders, interim release orders as a \nresult of pending criminal charges or other court orders. Its purpose is to provide direction to \nofficers where there is a conflict between removal orders and decisions made in judicial \nproceedings. By virtue of A50(a), the enforcement of a removal order is deemed subservient or \nsecondary to a decision made in judicial proceedings and to the proper administration of justice. \n \nIn order for A50(a) to apply, the following conditions must be met: \n \n \na decision was made (including final judgements and interlocutory orders); \n \n \nin a judicial proceeding (a proceeding in a legally constituted court); \n \n \nat which the PS Minister was given the opportunity to make submissions; and \n \n \nthis decision would be directly contravened by the enforcement of the removal order. \n \nIf these conditions do not exist, then an A50(a) stay of removal is not in effect and the removal \norder should be enforced as soon as possible. In order to determine whether the decision that was \nmade at a judicial proceeding would be directly contravened by the enforcement of a removal order, \nofficers must review the individual circumstances, on a case-by-case basis, to determine whether \nremoval would contravene the decision. To ensure consistency in the application of an A50(a) stay \nwith respect to decisions made at judicial proceedings, officers should contact their manager, \nsupervisor or regional JLO for further guidance. \n \nSince each case must be evaluated on its individual circumstances, officers should be aware of the \ncomplexity of A50(a) and must also consider R234 when determining the applicability of the stay \nprovision. \n \nWhen making removal arrangements, officers may encounter situations where persons will invoke \nthe statutory stay provisions in A50(a) in an effort to prolong their stay in Canada or avoid removal \naltogether. In order to ensure that removals are not unduly delayed or unlawfully carried out, \nofficers should carefully assess each situation to ensure proper and correct processing. The \nfollowing case circumstances should be used as a guideline only and may be of assistance when \ndetermining the applicability of A50(a). If the case scenario is not described below, officers should \nconsult their regional JLO, regional program specialist, manager or supervisor for assistance to \nensure the consistent application of A50(a). \n \nFor more information on the application of A50(a) to different scenarios, see the examples in \nsections 12.2 to 12.13 below.  \n \n \n12.2  Person under removal is the subject of a probation  \n         order \nNote: A50(a) does not apply. \n \nThe Federal Court of Appeal decision in MCI v. Cuski decided that the goal of the enforcement of a \nremoval order is to remove persons from Canada as soon as possible. The goal of removing persons\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nwho are the subject of a removal order is more important than the need to satisfy the terms of \nprobation orders, the purpose of which is to integrate people back into the community. \nWhen removing a person subject to a probation order, officers should take the following steps: \n \n \nadvise the person and/or counsel that probation orders do not create a situation where a \nstatutory stay exists, and then proceed with removal arrangements; and \n \n \nensure that the regional Department of Justice is contacted if counsel indicates that they \nintend to file before the Federal Court to stay the removal. \n \n \n12.3 Person subject to a removal order has pending criminal  \n        charges \nNote: A50(a) may apply. \nIf there is an indication that the person has pending criminal charges, officers should communicate \nwith the provincial or federal Crown, as the case may be, to determine if a statutory stay exists \npursuant to A50(a). \nIf a statutory stay applies, then officers should ask the Crown to either withdraw or stay the \ncriminal charges in order to allow for the expeditious removal of the individual concerned. \nOfficers should inform the Crown that the CBSA has an obligation to carry out removals as soon as \npossible (i.e. if such persons pose a danger to the public.) If the Crown agrees, in writing, to \nwithdraw or stay the criminal charges, either before or after removal is confirmed, the officer will \ndocument the file accordingly and proceed with the removal arrangements. Under R234(a), a \nstatutory stay does not exist where there is an agreement between the Attorney General and the \nCBSA to withdraw or stay criminal charges once the CBSA confirms that a subject has been \nremoved from Canada. \nIf a statutory stay exists and the Crown does not stay charges, officers should document the file \naccordingly and update GCMS and NCMS to indicate that removal is stayed until the criminal matter \nis dealt with. Officers should monitor these files as the particular circumstances of the case may \nchange and a statutory stay may no longer apply. \n \n12.4 \n Person under removal is the subject of a subpoena   \n             to appear as a witness in criminal proceedings \nNote: A50(a) provisions may apply. \n \nOfficers may also encounter situations where the person being removed is the subject of a \nsubpoena or summons obliging them to appear as a witness at a criminal trial or in other criminal \nproceedings. A criminal subpoena/summons is a command by the court to the person to appear as \na witness at subsequent criminal proceedings. \n \nBefore proceeding with removal in these circumstances, the officer in charge of the removal should \nobtain as much information as possible (from either the Crown attorney or defence counsel as the \ncase may be) in order to determine whether removal is prohibited pursuant to A50(a) and, if so, \nwhether it is possible to have the subpoena cancelled or, alternatively, whether the person’s return \nto Canada after removal should be facilitated in order to allow the person to comply with the \nsubpoena. The following should be considered:\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \n \n \nwhether the Crown or defence would be willing to withdraw/cancel the subpoena or use \nalternative means of testifying. [R234(b) confirms that no statutory stay exists where there \nis an agreement between the Attorney General and the CBSA to cancel or withdraw a \nsubpoena once the CBSA confirms that a subject has been removed from Canada]; \n \n \nif defence counsel does not want to withdraw the subpoena, the CBSA may request that the \nCrown apply to quash the subpoena; \n \n \nif not, and the person is capable of returning to Canada at their own expense, the CBSA may \nconsider whether officers will facilitate the person’s return to Canada, with the appropriate \nconditions, for the purpose of complying with the subpoena. Before removing a person in \nthis situation, officers should discuss the circumstances with the Crown; and  \n \n \nif a statutory stay exists, then the file should be documented accordingly with appropriate \nremarks in GCMS and NCMS. The officer should monitor the file to ensure that the person \nconcerned is removed from Canada after completing their testimony and/or is no longer \nrequired for the judicial proceeding. \n \nWhere there are compelling reasons to remove the person and it has been decided to proceed with \nremoval and facilitate the person’s return to allow compliance with the subpoena, the file will be \ndocumented accordingly. In addition, the appropriate entry will be made in GCMS or in NCMS, \nwhere available, and the file will be carefully monitored to ensure that removal is carried out at the \nappropriate time and without delay. As well, the person concerned, their counsel or the Crown \nattorney (as the case may be) will be kept informed, as required. In addition, the regional \nDepartment of Justice (Immigration Section) will be given advance warning of the removal \narrangements in order to prepare for any anticipated stay motion before the Federal Court. \n \n \n12.5  No subpoena but person under removal is required     \n                to appear as a witness in criminal proceedings \nNote: A50(a) provisions do not apply. \nOfficers may occasionally encounter situations where the subject of the removal order is required as \na witness in a criminal proceeding but is not subject to a subpoena or a summons. In some cases, \nthe CBSA may receive written communication from either the Crown attorney or the defence \ncounsel to the effect that the person to be removed is required to testify in a criminal proceeding. \nPrior to IRPA implementation, paragraph 50(1)(b) of the former Immigration Act, 1976, applied; \nhowever, this paragraph has not been incorporated into IRPA. \nConsequently, it is the CBSA’s position that since no court order exists, the provisions of A50(a) do \nnot apply. The appropriate party and the Crown should be so advised, and removal will proceed in \nthe normal manner. The regional Department of Justice (Immigration Section) will be given advance \nwarning of the removal arrangements in order to prepare for any anticipated stay motion. \n \n12.6  Person is subject of an appearance notice given by a  \n         peace officer in a criminal matter \nNote: A50(a) provisions do not apply. \nIt is the CBSA’s opinion that an appearance notice (Form 9 s. 493 of the Criminal Code) issued to a \nperson by a peace officer does not create a stay pursuant to A50(a) as long as the appearance \nnotice has not been reviewed by a judge. A peace officer in this specific case is not a judicial officer\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nfor the purposes of A50(a) and thus their decision does not fall within the parameters of a judicial \nproceeding. In these specific cases, a foreign national has not been detained or charged for a crime \nnor has the foreign national gone before a judicial body or tribunal such as a justice of the peace. \nInstead, the foreign national is required to report to court to answer charges not yet laid against \nthem. \nIf the person was issued an appearance notice and failed to comply with the conditions in Form 9, a \nbench warrant may be issued. If a bench warrant exists, officers should consult the Crown before \nremoving such persons. \nShould this specific type of case arise, officers should follow the procedures outlined in section 11.3 \nabove and inform the person if the CBSA is proceeding with removal. Before removal, officers must \ndiscuss the case with a supervisor and/or contact the regional JLO. The appearance notice is \ncurrently under review and the case circumstances should be examined carefully before such \npersons are removed. Depending on the specific details of the case, a supervisor or regional JLO \nmay ask the officer to contact Crown counsel to seek a stay of proceedings. If not, the officer \nshould proceed with removal and keep the regional JLO advised if counsel indicates they will be \nfiling a stay application to prevent removal. \n \n \n12.7  Person under removal is subject of a civil summons  \n                 or a subpoena \nNote: A50(a) provisions may apply. \nPeriodically, officers may encounter situations where a person being removed is the subject of a \nsubpoena or summons and is required to testify at a civil trial (non-criminal proceeding). The CBSA \nhas taken the position that, where a summons or subpoena is issued by a court clerk or a registrar, \nit does not constitute a decision in a judicial proceeding, and a stay under A50(a) does not apply. \nHowever, the CBSA is reviewing other similar circumstances to determine whether a civil subpoena \nor summons would be considered a judicial proceeding in the application of A50(a). \nBefore proceeding with removal action, officers should carefully review the civil summons or \nsubpoena to determine whether removal is prohibited pursuant to A50(a), taking into account the \nCBSA’s position. If officers are uncertain as to whether a document constitutes a decision made in a \njudicial proceeding as contemplated by A50(a), they should consult their supervisors and/or refer \nsuch cases to their regional JLO, regional program specialist, manager or supervisor, as the case \nmay be. In cases where it appears that a person is invoking this stay provision solely to delay the \nremoval process, this information should be brought to the attention of the regional JLO, regional \nprogram specialist, manager or supervisor. \n \n12.8  Person under removal is subject to a civil court order \nNote: A50(a) provisions may apply. \nIn some cases, the person may be the subject of a court order requiring them to appear at a trial \ninvolving civil proceedings (i.e., relating to family and/or custody issues, etc.) or other civil court \norder which may affect the ability to remove them. As such, a civil court order will constitute “a \ndecision made in a judicial proceeding,” and A50(a) may apply, depending on whether enforcing the \nremoval order will directly contravene this decision. \nBefore proceeding with removal action, officers should carefully review the civil court orders to \ndetermine whether removal is prohibited pursuant to A50(a), taking into account the interpretation \noutlined in this document. If officers are uncertain as to whether a document constitutes a decision\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \nmade in a judicial proceeding as contemplated by A50(a), they should consult their supervisors \nand/or refer such cases to their regional JLO. Cases in which it appears that persons are invoking \nthis stay provision solely to thwart the removal process should be brought to the attention of the \nregional JLO. \n \n12.9  Person under removal is subject of a notice of  \n         examination in a lawsuit (discovery process) \nNote: A50(a) provisions do not apply. \nIn the case of Shulgatov et al v. MCI , a Federal Court judge dismissed a stay application by ruling \nthat notices of examination in civil suits did not create a statutory stay pursuant to paragraph \n50(1)(a) of the former Immigration Act, 1976. The principal applicant in this case was involved in a \nserious motor vehicle accident and was both the plaintiff and the defendant in the pending law \nsuits. The judge ruled that a notice of examination during the discovery process of a lawsuit does \nnot constitute an order made by a judicial body and therefore does not result in a statutory stay of \nremoval. Upon further review, it is the CBSA’s opinion that a notice of examination in a lawsuit does \nnot constitute a decision in a judicial proceeding for the purposes of A50(a). There is no statutory \nstay. \nOfficers should consult their supervisors and/or refer such cases to their regional JLO or other \nsimilar officer when counsel claims that a statutory stay applies and that removal is prohibited. If \nthe regional JLO or other similar officer is satisfied that no statutory stay exists, then officers should \nadvise counsel and proceed with removal. They should also ensure that the regional JLO is aware of \nthe removal actions if counsel intends to file a stay application. \n12.10 Person under removal has a court date for a legal  \n           name change \nNote: A50(a) provisions do not apply. \nIn the case of Louis v MCI, 2001, a Federal Court judge dismissed a stay application by the \napplicant, who claimed that he had to appear in superior court for a motion to legally change his \nname on a marriage certificate. The applicant filed the motion only after he was told he was being \nremoved from Canada. The Court concluded that the provisions of paragraph 50(1)(a) of the \nImmigration Act, 1976, do not apply in these circumstances, where the applicant could decide for \nhimself the date of his appearance in court and could have decided not to present the motion. \nConsequently, it is the CBSA’s opinion that these types of judicial matters do not invoke a statutory \nstay pursuant to A50(a). \n \n12.11 Person under removal is subject of a conditional  \n          sentence order (CSO) \nNote: A50(b) provisions do not apply.  \nIn the October 19, 2017 decision Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 2017 \nSCC 50, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) concluded that a conditional sentence order imposed \npursuant to the regime set out in ss. 742 to 742.7 of the Criminal Code of Canada (CCC) does not \nconstitute a \"a term of imprisonment\" (aka jail or prison term) under paragraph 36(1)(a) of the \nIRPA.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nThe SCC interpreted the meaning of \"term of imprisonment\" as articulated in paragraph 36(1)(a) to \nrefer to \"prison\" (aka jail time) and does not include conditional sentence orders served outside of \nprison. \nFurther information related to the Tran decision is available in the Operational Bulletin, PRG-2017-\n67. \nIndividuals who are serving a conditional sentence order do not benefit from a stay of removal in \naccordance with A50(a) or A50(b).  \nA50(b) specifies that a removal order is stayed in the case of a foreign national sentenced to a \nterm of imprisonment in Canada, until the sentence is completed. Since a conditional sentence \norder is not considered to be a term of imprisonment, it does not constitutes a stay of removal \nbecause the individual is not incarcerated or detained in any penitentiary, jail, reformatory or \nprison. As such, officers must enforce a removal order while the individual is serving a conditional \nsentence order. If the person leaves Canada during the term of the conditional sentence order, the \nofficer should follow the procedures to confirm departure outlined in section 10.1 (1) for cases \nwhere departure occurs prior to the order not coming into force. \n \n12.12 \nPerson under removal is subject of a RPD  \n                summons \nNote: A50(a) provisions do not apply. \nIn the case of Gillani v. MCI, the applicant was the subject of a subpoena for a Convention Refugee \nDetermination Division (CRDD) matter and sought a stay of removal. The Federal Court Trial \nDivision dismissed this application as it ruled that the applicant failed to raise a serious issue. \nConsequently, the CRDD was not a judicial body for the purposes of the former Immigration Act, \n1976. \nThe CBSA is of the position that a summons issued by the Refugee Protection Division is not \nconsidered a decision at a judicial proceeding for the purposes of A50(a) and a stay of removal does \nnot apply in this circumstance. Deferral of removal in these types of cases may encourage abuse of \nthe summons process and may make it more difficult for the CBSA to remove persons in these \nsimilar circumstances in the future. \nOfficers should inform the person and their counsel that removal is proceeding, as there is no \nstatutory stay of removal. They should also keep their regional JLO or other similar officer advised if \ncounsel indicates that they will be filing a stay application to halt the removal. \n \n12.13 Requests for deferral from other enforcement  \n          agencies \nNote: A50(a) provisions do not apply. \nPeriodically, the CBSA may receive requests to delay removals from other enforcement agencies \nthat do not fall within the parameters of the A50(a) provision or other stay provisions in the IRPA or \nRegulations. Such cases should always be referred to the supervisor or manager, who will decide \nwhether or not to defer removal, based on the particular facts of the case and the CBSA’s interest in \nbeing cooperative with other enforcement agencies that share similar interests, goals and concerns. \nA decision to defer removal in these circumstances will be an administrative one and will not fall \nunder the A50(a) provisions. Officers should document the file accordingly and update NCMS. The\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nfile should be monitored to determine if the enforcement agency still requires the person to remain \nin Canada. Once the enforcement agency no longer requires the person, removal should occur as \nsoon as possible. \n \n13 Procedure: Temporary Suspension of Removals (TSR)   \n       and Administrative Deferral of Removals (ADR) \n \n13.1   \nLegislation \nThe IRPA provides the PS Minister with the specific legal authority to temporarily suspend or \n reinstate removals according to changes in country conditions. \n \nImposing a TSR or ADR under R230(1):  \nRegulation 230 outlines the basic criteria for determining whether to maintain or suspend removals \nto a particular country: \n \nR230(1) The Minister may impose a stay on removal orders with respect to a country or a place if \nthe circumstances in that country or place pose a generalized risk to the entire civilian population as \na result of: \n \na) armed conflict within the country or place; \nb) environmental disaster resulting in a substantial temporary disruption of living \nconditions; or \nc) any situation that is temporary and generalized. \n \nCancellation: \nR230(2) The Minister may cancel the stay if the circumstances referred to in subsection (1) no \nlonger pose a generalized risk to the entire civilian population. \n \n13.2   \nExceptions \nR230(3) The stay does not apply to a person who: \n \na) is inadmissible under subsection 34(1) of the Act on security grounds; \nb) is inadmissible under subsection 35(1) of the Act on grounds of violating human or \ninternational rights; \nb.1) is inadmissible under subsection 35.1(1) of the Act on grounds of sanctions; \nc) is inadmissible under subsection 36(1) of the Act on grounds of serious criminality or under \nsubsection 36(2) of the Act on grounds of criminality; \nd) is inadmissible under subsection 37(1) of the Act on grounds of organized criminality; \ne) is a person referred to in section F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention; or \nf) \ninforms the Minister in writing that they consent to their removal to a country or place to \nwhich a stay of removal applies. \n \nFor cases that fall under paragraph 230(3)(f), the Officer should have the individual complete a \nstatutory declaration stating that they are voluntarily returning to their home country despite the TSR \nor ADR.  \n \nNote: For the above-mentioned exceptions, there is no need to consult NHQ in order to proceed with \nremoval.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \n13.3   \nGeneralized risk versus Individualized risk \nThe guiding principle of generalized risk is that the impact of the catastrophic event is so pervasive \nand widespread that it would be inconceivable to conduct general returns to that country until some \ndegree of safety is restored. These measures are not appropriate for countries with persistent and \nsystemic human rights problems, which constitute individualized risk, a process covered by individual \nprotection mechanisms such as the refugee determination process, the PRRA, and the H&C review \nprocess. \n \nIn addition, even though a situation of human rights violations may be widespread and long- \nstanding, it is an ongoing situation that is outside the scope of a sudden, catastrophic event which \ntemporarily throws a country into crisis. When evaluating general risk, considerations such as fear of \npersecution or personal risk to individuals ordered removed or returned to their country are not part \nof the process. A TSR or ADR are not supplementary nor a substitute for protection mechanisms that \nassess individual risk. \n \n13.4  \nCountries under TSR and ADR \nFor a list of countries that are currently under a TSR or ADR, refer to:   \n \nArrests, detentions and removals - Removal from Canada (cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) \n \n \n14 Procedure: Diplomatic assurances cases \nCanada does not impose the death penalty in any circumstance. Canadian courts view this type of \npunishment as an unlawful sanction that violates a person’s right to life under the Canadian \nCharter of Rights and Freedoms. If it is determined that a person under removal order faces more \nthan a mere possibility of charges punishable by death, diplomatic assurances may be sought. \nIf an officer encounters a case where the death penalty may be sought by the country to which they \nare being removed, they should refer the case to CBSA Case Management case-management@cbsa-\nasfc.gc.ca. Case Management will then work with IRCC and GAC to secure diplomatic assurances prior \nto removal.   \n \n15 Procedure: Interim Measures and Precautionary  \n       Measures Requests \nCanada is signatory to several human rights treaty bodies and has accepted the jurisdiction of  \nthese organizations to hear individual complaints lodged against Canada. Complaints involving \nimmigration or protection issues can result in a treaty body asking Canada to refrain from removing \nthe person concerned until it has considered the complaint thoroughly. The request is called an \ninterim measures request or precautionary measures request, depending on the treaty body. \nThe Federal Court has confirmed that interim measures and precautionary measures are not legally \nbinding on Canada as per: Ahani, Dadar, Sogi and Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration).  Only the PS Minister can make a determination if a stay is warranted under s. 50(e) \nof IRPA.  If the Minister declines to issue a stay of removal, the CBSA may once again proceed with \nremoval.  However, Canada engages in good faith with the treaty bodies and gives requests/\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \ndecisions serious consideration and tries whenever feasible to comply with them while ensuring that \nthe integrity of Canada’s immigration and refugee protection processes are maintained. This means \nthat for most cases Canada will not remove individuals while an interim measures request remains \nin effect. \n \n15.1   Who can make an interim measures or  \n          precautionary measures request \nAs per s. 3(3)(F) of IRPA, the Act is to be construed in a manner that is consistent with any human \nrights treaties that Canada is a signatory to. There is a presumption by the international community \nthat Canada will abide by interim measures requests.  \nThe treaties and the bodies that can request a stay of removal are: \nTreaties \nTreaty Body \nConvention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination Against \nWomen  \nUnited Nations Committee on the \nElimination of Discrimination against \nWomen  (CEDAW)  \nConvention against Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment  \n \nUnited Nations Committee Against Torture \n(UNCAT) \nConvention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities  \nUN Committee on the on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities (CRPD) \nInternational Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights  \nUnited Nations Human Rights Committee  \n(UNHRC) \nAmerican Declaration of the Rights \nand Duties of Man  \n(This is the treaty that may request \nprecautionary measures) \n \nInter-American Commission on Human \nRights (IACHR)—this is a branch of the \nOrganization of American States (OAS) \n \n15.2  Procedures \nUpon receipt of the interim measures request, the Human Rights Law Section of the Department of \nJustice Canada notifies all relevant departments, including the CBSA Litigation Management Unit \n(LMU). LMU communicates with the responsible region by advising their JLOs that an interim \nmeasures request has been received and that CBSA cannot remove this person without direction \nfrom the PS Minister.  LMU is also responsible for updating GCMS. A copy of the notification from \nLMU must be added to the file, in addition to putting a red sticker on the file indicating an IMR has \nbeen issued.   \nOccasionally, the person concerned or counsel will present a copy of the IMR before Canada has \nreceived official notification.  In this instance, LMU should be notified immediately through regional \nJLOs.  \nOnce an interim measures request has been received, a request to lift the interim measures must \nbe presented to the treaty body for a decision.  When the treaty body provides its final views, the\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nCBSA and its partners will re-evaluate the case and determine next steps. The removal can also \nproceed if the PS Minister refuses to issue a stay under s.50(e) of IRPA. In these instances, LMU will \nnotify the respective region. \n \nPART III - Removal Preparation \n \n16 Procedure: Determining the method of enforcing a  \n       removal order \nIRPA prescribes that under A48(2), the foreign national against whom the removal order was made \nmust leave Canada immediately after the removal order becomes enforceable, and that it must be \nenforced as soon as possible. \nIn accordance with R235, a removal order that has not been enforced does not become void \nthrough the lapse of time. However, when a foreign national becomes a permanent resident, the \nremoval order becomes void through operation of law under A51. \nBefore an officer enforces a removal order, an assessment must take place to determine if the \nremoval order should be enforced through voluntary compliance or by the PS Minister. The \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations codify the determination process as a mandatory \nprocedure. During this process the officer must determine, through interviews with the foreign \nnational, the method (or modality) of enforcing the removal order. The final determination of how \nthe removal order is enforced rests with the officer. Under R237, a removal order can be enforced \neither through: \n \nvoluntary compliance by the foreign national (see section 16 below); or \n \nthe removal of a foreign national by the PS Minister (see section 17 below). \nIf the person does not meet the requirements of voluntary compliance, the PS Minister must \nenforce the removal order. \n \n16.1    Procedures to enforce a removal order \nFor general procedures on the enforcement of a removal order and the verification of departure of a \nperson under a departure, exclusion or deportation order, officers should refer to PART V – Verifying \nDeparture, which includes information related to: \n \n \nthe criteria for a removal order to become enforced; \n \nthe procedures to verify departure; \n \nthe procedures to complete a Certificate of Departure; \n \nverifying departure at airports; \n \nverifying departure to the U.S. from airports with pre-clearance facilities; \n \nverifying departure at land borders; and \n \npersons refused entry to their country of destination after a Certificate of Departure has been \nissued.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \n17 Procedure: Voluntary Compliance \nAs set out in R238(1), voluntary compliance allows a foreign national, who is the subject of an \nenforceable removal order to voluntarily remove themselves by appearing before an officer for a \ndetermination. The officer's assessment of the individual's circumstances will establish whether the \nforeign national meets the regulatory criteria set for voluntary compliance. This determination can  \nbe made by a CBSA officer either inland or at a POE. The designated authority for approving or \nrefusing voluntary compliance with the enforcement of a removal order under R238 is found in the \nDesignation of Officers and Delegation of Authority documents in IL 3, item 121. \n \n17.1   Requirements for voluntary compliance \nOfficers must be satisfied that the criteria set out in the Regulations have been met before \npermitting voluntary compliance with a removal order. Officers must be aware of the factors that \nwill guide them in making a determination on whether the foreign national can depart through \nvoluntary compliance. If a negative determination is made and the officer decides that the foreign \nnational does not meet all of the prescribed criteria for voluntary compliance, the foreign national \nthen becomes subject to removal by the Minister (see section 17 below). \n \nUnder R238(1), an officer must be satisfied that the foreign national meets all of the criteria for \nvoluntary compliance through a close examination of the oral and physical information available. In \norder for a foreign national to depart Canada by voluntary compliance, the foreign national must \ndemonstrate that they: \n \n \nhave the sufficient means (i.e., financial and transportation arrangements) to affect their \ndeparture to a country that will authorize their entry; \n \n \nhave the intent to voluntarily comply with R240(1)(a), R240(1)(b) and R240(1)(c) by: \no \nappearing before an officer to verify their departure, \no \nobtaining a Certificate of Departure [IMM0056B] from an officer, and \no \ndeparting from Canada; and \n \n \nwill be able to act on their intention to comply with R240. \n \nA person does not have to meet the requirements in R240(1)(d) for authorization to enter the \ndestination country after they have departed from Canada. These requirements should be \nconsidered during the assessment for voluntary compliance, but are not grounds for refusing a \nperson to leave on their own initiative. If the person does not meet the requirements of R240(1)(d) \nafter departing Canada, they remain the subject of an unenforced removal order.  \n \nFor instructions on the procedures to follow after a person has been refused admission to another \ncountry, refer to section 37 below. \n \n \nSubmission of a choice country of destination  \nIn addition to the foreign national complying with the voluntary compliance criteria (set out above), \nthey must submit their choice country of destination to the officer [R238(2)]. This process is to \nensure that the person is not a danger and is not departing Canada to flee justice here or in another \ncountry. To make a determination on these grounds, the officer should conduct background \nsearches [i.e., search of file information, Global Case Management System (GCMS), the National \nCase Management System (NCMS), CPIC, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Interpol]\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nto determine previous, current or pending criminal involvement. During the voluntary compliance \nassessment, the officer must approve the chosen country of destination unless: \n \nin the officer’s opinion, the person poses a danger to the public; \n \nthe foreign national is a fugitive from justice in Canada or another country; or \n \nthe foreign national is seeking to evade or frustrate the cause of justice in Canada or \nanother country. \n \nIf any of the criteria for voluntary compliance are not met, including refusal of a foreign national’s \nchoice country of destination, the foreign national must be removed by the Minister (see section 17 \nbelow). This ensures that the person is removed to the appropriate country where they are wanted. \n \n17.2    What happens after voluntary compliance requirements   \n                   are met \nWhen voluntary compliance is met, the officer should proceed to enforce the removal order and \nverify the departure of the foreign national from Canada. \n \nWhen an officer determines that a foreign national meets the requirements of voluntary compliance \nunder R238, the officer should take the following steps: \n \n \ncounsel the person to settle their personal affairs and transportation arrangements as they \nare required to leave as soon as possible; \n \nadvise the person on their requirement to report to the CBSA to have their removal verified; \n \nin cases where the person is under a deportation order, advise the person that \narrangements will be made to have their fingerprints and photograph taken; \n \nwhen appropriate, give the foreign national a removal order information kit that includes \ninstructions for the foreign national to verify departure, the consequences of not verifying \ndeparture, the consequences of a deportation after the lapse of the 30-day applicable period \nfor departure orders, and the addresses and hours of the POEs that the foreign national \nshould use; \n \nfor control purposes, advise the appropriate POE in advance to ensure that the office is \naware that the foreign national will be departing Canada through that POE on an intended \ndate; and \n \nfor security purposes, and if necessary, send the POE the \"Envelope: Removal Documents\" \n[IMM 1226B] including the person's passport/travel document, IMM0056B, etc., before the \nperson appears at the POE to verify their departure. \n \nOnce the foreign national appears before an officer at the POE, that officer should verify the \ndeparture (see Part V –Verifying Departure below) of the foreign national from Canada. \n \nNote: A foreign national who has been authorized to depart Canada voluntarily and has failed to \nleave as required may be the subject of a warrant for arrest for removal and should be counselled \naccordingly [A55]. For further information on the issuance of a warrant for arrest, refer to ENF 7.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n17.3    What happens after voluntary compliance requirements  \n           are not met \nWhen a foreign national does not want to depart Canada voluntarily or does not meet the \nrequirements for voluntary compliance under R238, the officer, either at the inland office or POE, \nshould take the following steps: \n \n \nconsider whether arrest and detention is appropriate in order to effect removal by the \nMinister; \n \ncontact the appropriate law enforcement authorities if the person is fleeing justice in \nCanada; and \n \nmake further arrangements for removal by the Minister (see below). \n \n \n18 Procedure: Removal by the Minister \nR239 sets out mandatory criteria for the enforcement of a removal order by the Minister. The \ndelegated level of authority for deciding whether a removal order shall be enforced by the Minister \ncan be found in the Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority documents in IL 3, item \n200. \n \nOfficers inland or at a POE must decide whether a foreign national will be removed by the Minister \nand proceed with removal arrangements when: \n \n \na foreign national did not enforce their removal order through voluntary compliance; \n \nan officer has determined that voluntary compliance is not allowed; or \n \na foreign national's choice country of destination for voluntary compliance has not been \napproved because they are a danger to the public, a fugitive from justice in Canada or \nanother country, or are seeking to evade or frustrate the cause of justice in Canada or \nanother country. \n \nWhen determining the country to which the foreign national should be removed, the Minister has \nthe authority to remove the foreign national to any of the countries outlined in R241(1). The \ncountries to which a foreign national can be removed include the following: \n \n \nthe country from which they came to Canada; \n \nthe country in which they last permanently resided before coming to Canada; \n \na country of which they are a national or citizen; or \n \ntheir country of birth. \n \n18.1  \nRemoval to another country \nIf it is determined by an officer that the foreign national is unable to return to any country listed in \nR241(1) because that country will not authorize their entry, R241(2) allows the Minister to: \n \nselect any country that will authorize the entry of the person within a reasonable time; and \n \n \nremove the foreign national to that country. \n \nNote: The delegated level for selecting another country, other than those described in R241(1), that \nwill authorize the person’s entry is at an executive or managerial level, depending on the particular \nregion. For further information on the delegated authorities to perform this function, refer to IL 3.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \n18.2  \nCountry of removal for persons who have violated  \nhuman or international rights \nIn the case of a person who is the subject of a removal order based on inadmissibility grounds for \nviolating human or international rights under A35(1)(a), the person must be removed by the Minister \nin accordance with R241(3) to a country that the Minister determines will authorize their entry. \nThis provision allows the Department to have greater control over the removal of these serious cases. \nNote: The delegated level of authority for selecting a country that will authorize the person’s entry is \nat an executive or managerial level, depending on the particular region. For further information on \nthe delegated authorities to perform this function, refer to IL 3. \n \n19 Procedure: Removal of persons who are detained  \nOfficers should be aware of the enforcement procedures to be followed when a permanent resident or \nforeign national is in a correctional institution or other detention facility. \nOfficers can remove detained persons from Canada who: \n \n \nare in CBSA custody after being delivered by an institution at the end of their period of \nincarceration under A59; \n \n \nhave been arrested and detained under A55(1) or A55(2) or A58(2) for removal from \nCanada; or \n \n \nhave been detained pursuant to A81 and ordered released under A82.4 for their departure \nfrom Canada. \n \nOfficers must remove detained persons as expeditiously as possible and take care to determine if there \nare any factors such as legal and non-legal impediments that could prevent the enforcement of the \nremoval order. It is important that officers do not remove a person who is subject to a stay of removal \nunder A50(b), where they are serving a sentence in Canada until the sentence is complete. For further \ninformation on stays of removal, refer to section 10.   \n \nTransitional provisions will prevail for many years when an inmate is sentenced prior to the enactment \nof IRPA. In these cases, the procedures under the former Immigration Act, 1976, will apply. \n \nFor inmates sentenced after the coming into force of IRPA, the new provisions of the Corrections and \nConditional Release Act will apply, as the presence of a removal order will render the inmate ineligible \nfor unescorted temporary absence or day parole until the full parole eligibility date. For further \ninformation on persons serving sentences subject to enforcement action, refer to ENF 22.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \n20 Procedure: File review and pre-removal interview  \nWhen the removal order becomes enforceable, the officer planning the removal should \nperform a final review of the file before conducting a removal interview. The officer \nshould take particular note of the person's case history in order to assess the safety and \nsecurity of all individuals who will be involved in the removal. In conducting this \nassessment, the officer should consider the person’s psychological, behavioral and \ncriminal history. The officer's evaluation of risk should be noted in the file and in NCMS \nand GCMS. During the removals process, officers should be continuously updating the \nphysical file, GCMS and NCMS as information is received. The Removal Checklist and \nFile Audit form [BSF522] could be used to assist the officer with documentation on the \nphysical file. \nIn cases where the person subject to the removal is a minor, the officer must ensure \nthat a competent representative accompanies the minor during the interview. In the \ncase of a detained person, removal arrangements should be made as expeditiously as \npossible to minimize detention costs. \nDuring the pre-removal interview, officers should: \n \nconfirm that the person is not a Canadian Citizen or Status Indian as defined \nin the Indian Act and that they are the same person described in the \nremoval order;* \n \nupdate the person on the status of their case; \n \nadvise the person that the removal order is enforceable and that they are to \nbe removed from Canada; \n \nseek the person's assistance in obtaining a travel document and any other \ninformation that may be required; \n \nnotify the person of the opportunity to make an application for a PRRA, if \napplicable; \n \nmake a determination to allow voluntary compliance or removal by the PS \nMinister; \n \ninquire if the foreign national has the financial means to enforce their \nremoval and explain the consequences listed in procedure 47 – Requirement \nto seek repayment of removal costs, should the CBSA pay for the cost of \ntheir removal from Canada; \nin the case of a person who has been authorized by an officer to depart \nCanada voluntarily, advise them that they must leave Canada immediately \nand enforce their order as soon as possible. Officers may allow a person \nsubject to voluntary removal some time to organize their personal affairs \nbefore departing from Canada (two to three weeks should be sufficient); and  \n \ncounsel the person on the consequences of the removal order, the effect of \nthe removal order, the requirements to return to Canada and the \nconsequences of non-compliance (see section 9). \n \n*When confirming identity or when new information comes to light relating to a \npossible identity concern, the officer should take the necessary steps to satisfy \nthemselves that the person’s identity is one and the same as the identity under which \nthe enforcement action is being taken. Information to assist in confirming identity may \nvary and can include but not limited to: photos of the individual on file, identity \ndocuments previously seized, and notes to file, which capture verification already \ncompleted in the past. In all cases, officers are required to document what information \nwas assessed and the outcome.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nThe IRPR stipulates that a study and work permit automatically become invalid once a \nremoval order is enforceable. As such, when officers are preparing removal \narrangements with the foreign national, it is important for the officers to advise the \nforeign national that their study and/or work permit(s) have been cancelled and that \nthey can no longer study and/or work in Canada. Officers must notate on the file that \nthe foreign national has been advised.  GCMS must be updated by changing the status \nof the work permit and/or study permit document to “inactive” to reflect that the \nforeign national is no longer eligible to work or study in Canada. Additionally, the study \npermit and/or work permit should be attached to the file, if it is available during the \ninterview.  \n \nIf the person fails to appear either at their pre-removal interview or at the POE on the \nscheduled date of removal, a warrant under A55(1) may be issued for removal and a \nwarrant package sent to WRC for entry into CPIC. Appropriate information should also \nbe input into GCMS and NCMS. Further details are available in ENF 7, Investigations and \nArrests. \n \n21 Procedure: Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA)  \nPRRA is a process which assesses risk prior to the removal of a person. The procedures \ndescribed in this section are intended to guide officers in determining the most \nappropriate timing for IRCC to do a risk review under the PRRA program for a person \nwith a removal order that is in force. This section is outlined in section 115 of IRPA and \nsection 160 of the IRPR. \n \n21.1 Who may apply for a PRRA? \nA person in Canada, other than a person referred to in subsection 115(1), may apply \nto the Minister of IRCC for protection under the PRRA provisions if they are subject to \na removal order that is in force under A49 or are named in a certificate described in \nA77(1). For clarification, the following persons may make an application for a PRRA: \n \n \na person who did not previously seek protection; \n \na previous post-determination refugee claimant in Canada class (PDRCC) \nclaimant (PDRCC cases are automatically transferred to the PRRA program \nunder the transitional rules in R346); \n \ncertain failed refugee claimants (see 25.2 for those failed claimants who are \nineligible to apply for a PRRA); \n \nan ineligible refugee protection claimant (with exception); \n \na person at a POE who claimed protection after a removal order was issued; \n \na person inland who claimed protection after a removal order was issued; \n \na person named in a security certificate [A77(1)]; \n \na person described under A112(3)(a) or (b). This person is the subject of an \nA44 report for A34(1), A35(1), A36(1) or A37(1) for which a finding was \nmade that determined them inadmissible on these grounds; \n \na person described under A112(3)(c). The Immigration and Refugee Board \nhas rejected the person’s claim for refugee protection based on section F of \nArticle 1 of the Refugee Convention; and \n \na person described under A112(3)(d). The PS Minister and the IRCC Minister \nhave signed a certificate referred to in A77(1). \n \nWhen a person is entitled to apply for a PRRA, the officer must complete the “PRRA \nInitiation” screen in GCMS and NCMS.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \n21.2 Who may not apply for a PRRA? \nThere are exceptions to who may apply for a PRRA. The exceptions relate to persons \nwho already have protection or have other means of seeking protection. A person may \nnot apply for a PRRA if they are: \n \na person referred to in A115(1); \n \na person who is the subject of an authority to proceed with extradition; \n \na person who is ineligible under A101(1)(e) – Safe third country provision; \nperson for whom less than 12 months* has passed since: \n \ntheir claim for refugee protection was last rejected – unless is was rejected \nunder subsection 109(3) or on the basis of section E or F of Article 1 of the \nRefugee Convention – or determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the RPD \nin the case where no appeal was made and no application was made to the \nFederal Court for leave to commence an application for judicial review, or \n \ntheir claim for refugee protection was determined to be withdrawn or \nabandoned by the Refugee Appeal Division, or \n \nthe day on which the Federal Court refused their application for leave to \ncommence an application for judicial review, or denied their application for \njudicial review, with respect to their claim for refugee protection, unless that \nclaim was deemed to be rejected under subsection 109(3) or was rejected on \nthe basis of section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention; or  \n \na person for whom less than 12 months* has passed, or in the case of a \nnational of a country that is designated under subsection 109.1(1)*, less than \n36 months* has passed since: \n \ntheir claim for protection was last rejected or was determined to be withdrawn \nor abandoned by the Minister, in the case where no application was made to \nthe Federal Court for leave to commence an application for judicial review, or \n \ntheir application for protection was rejected or determined to be withdrawn or \nabandoned by the Minister, or \n \nthe Federal Court refused their application for leave to commence an \napplication for judicial review, or denied their application for judicial review, \nwith respect to their application for protection. \n \nNote: IRCC is not under any obligation to assess risk to persons who wish to leave \nvoluntarily and whose removal order is not in force. Therefore, the CBSA does not \nprovide notification of a PRRA to these persons. \n*In 2019, Canada removed all countries from the designated country of origin (DCO) \nlist, effectively suspending the DCO policy, introduced in 2012, until it can be repealed \nthrough future legislative changes. \n \n12 month PRRA Bar \nCertain unsuccessful refugee claimants or previous PRRA applicants may be barred from \napplying for a PRRA as described in paragraphs A112(2)(b.1) and A112(2)(c). \n \nBefore notifying an unsuccessful refugee claimant of their entitlement to apply for a \nPRRA (further to section R160), or before assessing a PRRA, the officer must verify if \nthe person is subject to the 12-month PRRA bar. \n \nIn exceptional circumstances, for individuals who are barred from applying for a PRRA, \nCBSA may request that IRCC reviews a request for a PRRA bar waiver under A25(1) in \nthe context of a request to defer removal. See section 20.4 for more details.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nApplicability of the PRRA bar \nThe 12-month PRRA bar applies to the following persons: \n \n \npersons who have received a negative decision from the Immigration \nRefugee Board (IRB) on a claim for refugee protection; \n \npersons who have received a negative decision from IRCC on a past PRRA \napplication; and  \n \npersons who have received a negative decision from the Federal Court (FC) \non an application for leave or judicial review regarding a claim for refugee \nprotection or a PRRA decision. \n \nThe PRRA bar does not apply to individuals whose refugee claim has been \nrejected on the basis of sections E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee \nConvention refugee protection has been vacated under subsection A109(3). \n \n \nCalculating the bar \nThe bar is calculated from the date of the most recent Refugee Protection Division \n(RPD), Refugee Appeals Division (RAD) or PRRA decision, or from the date the FC \nrefuses the application for leave or confirms a negative RPD, RAD or PRRA decision. \n \nThe date of the decision is considered to be one of the following: \n \nwhen an IRB member states the decision and gives the reasons, if the decision is \ngiven orally at a hearing; \n \nwhen an IRB member signs and dates the reason for the decision, if the decision \nis made in writing; \n \nwhen the PRRA officer provides the written decision (following a PRRA); \n \nwhen the application for leave of the RPD, RAD or previous PRRA decision is \ndenied by the FC; or  \n \nwhen the judicial review of the RPD, RAD or previous PRRA decision is rejected \nby the FC. \n \nNote: As per A112(2)(b.1) and (c), the bar begins on the day of the decision when \nbased on the merits of the claim/appeal/application. The last day of the PRRA \nbar is the day before the 12-month anniversary of the decision date. \n \n \nInformation to consider during calculation \nAdditional due diligence should be taken to ensure the correct decision date is used \nwhen calculating the PRRA bar.  \n \nThe PRRA bar is triggered by a decision that has been perfected. If the Federal Court \ndismisses an application in which the merits of the original RPD/RAD/PRRA decision \nwere not examined, the dismissal does not trigger the PRRA bar.   \n \nThe following events will not trigger the PRRA bar: \n \n \nRAD dismisses an appeal on the basis of lack of jurisdiction.  \nExamples of such circumstances: \nClaimants who are exempt from the Canada-US Safe Third Country Agreement \n(STCA) are barred from appealing to the RAD. As such, a RAD decision \ndismissing for lack of jurisdiction is not the correct trigger for the PRRA bar. \nRather, the PRRA bar would run from the negative RPD decision or the Federal\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n51 \n \nCourt decision dismissing the application for leave or judicial review of the \nnegative RPD decision, if any. \n \n \nRPD refuses an application to reopen a refugee claim, RAD refuses to reopen a \nrefugee appeal or a SIO refuses to reopen a PRRA application which was \npreviously denied or determined to be withdrawn or abandoned or the Federal \nCourt refuses an application for leave to commence an application for judicial \nreview, or denies an application for judicial review, with respect to the refusal to \nreopen. \n \nThese are not decisions rejecting a claim/appeal/application or declaring it abandoned \nor withdrawn as they do not speak to the merits of the claim/appeal/application. \n \n \nThe applicant discontinues their litigation before the Courts. This is not a \ndecision by the Court to deny leave or judicial review. \n \nExemptions from the 12-month bar \nUnder subsection A112(2.1), the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may exempt \nfrom the 12-month bar nationals or former habitual residents of a country where \nconditions have changed such that certain people could be subject to a risk within the \nmeaning of sections A96 and A97. Further information can be found in the program \ndelivery instructions on the IRCC website.   \n \n \n21.3  When a person is considered for a PRRA \nTo determine when a case should be considered for a PRRA, the officer must determine \nif the removal order meets the criteria under A48(1). This is established by ensuring \nthat there are no impediments to the removal under A49(1), A49(2), A50, R230, R231, \nor R233. An exception to this would be persons who are incarcerated. For details, see \n\"Persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment,\" in section 20.5 below. \n \nOnce all legal impediments have been overcome, the officer should determine whether \nremoval could be effected pending the acquisition of travel documents, visas and final \nitinerary arrangements. \n \nThe officer responsible for removal arrangements will determine whether a person may \nor may not apply for a PRRA. Officers should review A112(2), which outline exceptions \nfor making an application for a risk assessment prior to removal. If the person cannot \napply for a PRRA under A112(2), the officer will prepare the case for removal and, if \nrequested, verbally inform the person that they are unable to apply for protection. If \nthis person insists on submitting an application, the officer will inform the person that \nan application will not be supplied, as they do not meet the requirements to apply for a \nPRRA. Removal arrangements will continue. If the person wishes to access the Federal \nCourt, the officer must not delay removal for a decision by the Court unless a motion \nfor a stay of removal has been granted. \n \nNote: There is no stay of removal when a person is not given notification to apply for \nPRRA. It is important to update GCMS and NCMS by indicating that the person was not \nnotified of the opportunity to apply for a risk assessment.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n52 \n \n21.4  When an individual is ineligible to make a PRRA \nIn exceptional circumstances, a foreign national will be ineligible to make a PRRA \napplication, however an officer will have determined, in the context of a request to defer \nremoval that the new allegations of risk being raised by a foreign national meet the test \nset out in the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) decisions of Baron (2009) and Shpati \n(2011). The foreign national must be the subject of an enforceable removal order \nfollowing the rejection or withdrawal of a refugee protection claim or application for \nprotection, including refugee status that has ceased following a successful application by \nthe Minister under A108 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). \n \nIn the case of Shpati, the FCA confirmed that deferral should be reserved for those \napplications where: \n \n \nfailure to defer removal will expose the applicant to the risk of death, extreme \nsanction or inhumane treatment; \n \nany risk relied upon must have arisen since the last Pre-Removal Risk Assessment \n(PRRA) (or since the last risk assessment); and, \n \nthe alleged risk is of serious personal harm. \n \nNote: While this case law provides important guidance, officers nevertheless retain \ndiscretion to defer removal in cases where these three elements are not strictly met. For \nexample, new evidence may substantiate an allegation of risk that was previously \nconsidered. Similarly, evidence that pre-dates the last risk assessment may arise for \nwhich there are reasons it was not presented before the last risk assessment. \n \nIn circumstances where an officer concludes that a temporary administrative deferral of \nremoval is warranted, the following must occur: \n \nStep 1: Using the Notification to Principal Applicant Letter, the removals officer prepares \nand sends the notification to the principal applicant that, in light of the allegations of risk \nraised: (i) the removal has been temporarily deferred, (ii) the file will be brought to the \nattention of IRCC for a possible consideration under section 25.1 of the IRPA, (iii) the \nremoval may be rescheduled in accordance with the law, and (iv) there is no action \nrequired on the part of the principal applicant until the CBSA notifies of a date to attend a \nCBSA office. \n \nStep 2: Using the Notification to IRCC Letter, the officer prepares the IRCC notification to \ninclude: \n(i) notice that the removal has been temporarily deferred in light of the alleged risk, (ii) \nthe removals officer's reasons for the deferral (with reference to the applicant's \nsubmissions), \n(iii) notice that the risk allegations are being forwarded to IRCC for a possible \nconsideration under section 25.1 of the IRPA, and (iv) notice that supporting documents \nare attached, including the Refugee Protection Division (RPD)/Refugee Appeal Division \n(RAD) and/or previous PRRA decisions, the Basis of Claim (BOC) or the Personal \nInformation Form (PIF) and the evidence from submissions relied upon by the officer to \ndefer the removal. \n \nStep 3: The removals officer scans and emails the IRCC notification to CBSA Case \nManagement along with the supporting documents (i.e. the submissions relied upon by \nthe officer to defer the removal).\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n53 \n \nStep 4: CBSA Case Management forwards the email with supporting documents to \nIRCC Case Review. \n \nStep 5: IRCC considers the CBSA's request to review the file and emails the decision to \nCBSA Case Management. \n \nStep 6: CBSA Case Management informs the responsible regional office where the \ndeferral of removal originated for appropriate action. \n \n21.5  When to notify a person to apply for a PRRA \nThere are several trigger points that could decide the timing of the notification for a \nperson to submit a PRRA application. Based on a review of the case and the availability \nof travel documents, an officer should determine when it would be the most appropriate \ntime to notify the person of the opportunity to apply for a PRRA. Notification can be \ndone in person. This decision is at the discretion of the officer based on an assessment \nof the case. It is highly recommended that notification be given in person in the \nmajority of cases. The following circumstances include examples of trigger points that \nofficers should consider when assessing the timing for notifying the person to submit a \nPRRA application: \n \n \na valid travel document is available; \n \nan expired travel document or valid identity or birth record is available and a \nSingle Journey Document [IMM 5149B] can be used; \n \nthere is no valid travel document, an application for one has been submitted, \nthe respective embassy or mission has approved the application in principle \nand the travel document is forthcoming; or \n \nthere is no valid travel document and an application is completed and will be \nsubmitted to the embassy or mission. \n \nAs the CBSA deals with different embassies and missions located in Canada and abroad, \nofficers are subject to their terms when issuing travel documents. As a result, some \ntimelines for receiving these documents can be very short and others may be longer. \nMost timelines are dependent on whether the person has provided the documents \nrequired, while some are delayed for policy and political reasons. For this reason, the \nofficer must have the flexibility to determine when is the best time to inform the person \nof the availability of a PRRA. It is the CBSA’s goal to enforce a removal order as soon as \npossible after a negative risk decision has been made. \n \nIf an officer determines that an in-person interview is required, the person will be \ncontacted to discuss removal arrangements at a time and place to be determined by the \nofficer. The letter of convocation should request that the person bring any identity \ndocuments they may possess to the interview. Refer to the Letter of Convocation and \nLetter of Convocation for PDRCC for the sample wording of this letter. If the person \ndoes not report for the interview, the officer will forward the file to the Investigations \nUnit for the appropriate enforcement action. \n \nPersons sentenced to a term of imprisonment \nWhen a person who is serving a sentence is subject to a removal order, that removal \norder is stayed pursuant to A50(b) until the sentence is completed. If this person is \nsubject to a removal order that is in force pursuant to A112(1), the officer should \nassess when is the most beneficial time for the CBSA to notify the person of the \nopportunity to apply for a PRRA. The CBSA would benefit from an earlier PRRA decision\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n54 \n \nrather than wait until the person is under immigration detention to start the process. \nThis will reduce the detention time, costs and should expedite the removal. \n \n21.6  How to notify a person to apply for a PRRA \nThe onus is on the Removals Unit to notify the person under a removal order that a \nPRRA application may now be submitted. The PRRA notification will include the \nfollowing: \n \nPRRA Notification Failed Claimant Letter or PRRA Notification Non-\nclaimants Letter; \n \na PRRA application and guide; and \n \na Statement of No Intention Letter. \n \nIt is preferable that the notification be given in person during the removal interview. \nHowever, in some instances it may be more efficient to mail the notification directly to \nthe person or to another CBSA office for pickup. If the person is to pick up the envelope \nat a CBSA office, the recipient should sign and date an acknowledgement of receipt. \nA stay of removal is directly linked to the notification and is triggered when a person is \nnotified by the CBSA that they may make an application for a PRRA. \nAt the interview, the person will be counselled on the enforcement of the removal \norder. The officer should then evaluate with the person what other documentation is \nnecessary and should be available to enforce the removal order. If the person provides \na travel or identity document, the officer should seize the document and place it on file, \nas well as update GCMS/NCMS. If there are no travel documents available, the officer \nshould seek the person’s cooperation in completing the necessary applications. At this \ntime the officer may impose conditions for reporting purposes. \nIf the person is eligible and wishes to apply for a risk assessment, the officer must \nprovide the person with an application kit. A guide will explain the time frames as well \nas other instructions. \nIf the person does not intend to apply, a Statement of No Intention Letter should be \nsigned and dated immediately. Removal can then proceed, as there is no stay in effect. \nIf the person intends on completing the application, the removal order is stayed. For \nfurther information on stay provisions, refer to sections 10-11 above. The officer should \nupdate the NCMS/GCMS screens when notification is given in order to monitor the time \nframes for the filing of the application. \nNote: It is entirely up to the person concerned to decide whether or not to apply for a \nPRRA, and no pressure should be made by the officer or anyone else involved to \ninfluence a decision one way or the other. \n \n21.7 When a person does not want to apply for a PRRA \nFor persons not wishing to initiate a PRRA, the Statement of No Intention Letter to \napply for PRRA should be signed as soon as possible after notification has been given. \nThis will enable the CBSA to proceed with removal arrangements without waiting 15\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n55 \n \ndays to file the application, as provided for in the Regulations. If the person later \nwishes to file an application, the kit will be supplied at that time. However, there is no \nstay of removal to await the decision. Removal arrangements can proceed. \n \n21.8  The application for a PRRA \nThe person making the application should be instructed to mail the application to the \nappropriate PRRA Office within 15 days after notification was given. This is also stated \nin the kit. The PRRA Office is responsible for entering the receipt of the PRRA \napplication into GCMS and NCMS. This is important for determining whether the \napplication was received within the time limit and whether the stay of removal \ncontinues. \nIf the person files an application and submissions following the prescribed period of 15 \ndays after notification, the PRRA Unit will accept the application, update GCMS and \nNCMS, and make a decision. When an application is submitted beyond the 15-day \nperiod, the person will not benefit from a stay pursuant to R164, and removal \narrangements can proceed. There may be times when a late application is received \nand the officer conducting the removal may want to consult with their supervisor or \nmanager on whether the removal should be deferred pending the decision of the PRRA \napplication. The discretion to defer will be left entirely to the Removals Unit and \ncaution must be exercised before proceeding with removal. \nAll submissions in support of an application must be sent directly by the person \nconcerned to the PRRA Unit. That unit will enter the receipt in GCMS and NCMS. In \norder for the Removals Unit to remain at arm’s length of the PRRA Unit, all \napplications and submissions must be sent directly to the PRRA Office by the \napplicant. The Removals Unit must not accept any application or submissions for \nPRRAs. As well, the CBSA officer must not interact with the PRRA officer or discuss any \npending cases. Any communication between the Removals Unit and the PRRA Office \nmust be done through the coordinators/managers of these units. \nIf the applicant chooses to withdraw their PRRA application, the foreign national can \nattend a CBSA inland office and complete the Notification of Withdrawal: Application \nfor Pre-Removal Risk Assessment form.  As per R170, an application for protection \nmay be withdrawn by the applicant at any time by notifying the Minister in writing. \nThe application is declared to be withdrawn upon receipt of the notice and this \nremoves the statutory stay for removal arrangements to proceed. The CBSA officer \nmust immediately send a copy of the signed form via email to IRCC to update NCMS \nand GCMS. The CBSA officer will place the original signed copy on file.  \n \n21.9  PRRA decision \nPursuant to R164, a decision on a PRRA application will not be made until at least 30 \ndays after notification was given to the person concerned. The PRRA Office will enter \nthe type of decision and the date the decision was rendered into GCMS and NCMS. \nAll decisions, whether positive or negative, will be sent to the respective Removals Unit. \nThe CBSA officer will ask the person to come to the office by sending a Letter to attend \nand pick up the decision. The announcement of the decision will be made at the office\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n56 \n \nduring the removal interview with the officer. The officer should ask the person \nconcerned whether they require the reasons for the decision and, if so, obtain an \nacknowledgment of receipt of the reasons and decision from the person. \nThe convocation letter will again remind the person to bring any travel documents (i.e., \npassport, identity cards, documentation issued by the Canadian government and other \npertinent documentation) if these were not previously submitted or seized. \nGCMS and NCMS must always be updated to reflect these events. \nFor more information about PRRA decisions, see sections, 20.10 through 20.12 below. \nThe only circumstance in which a PRRA decision will be mailed directly to the claimant is \nin POE cases where the person has been returned to the United States to await the \noutcome of their PRRA decision. In these cases, the decision will be mailed to the \naddress provided on the PRRA application. \n \n21.10  Positive PRRA decision for A112(1) cases \nWhen applicants are advised of a positive PRRA decision, they should be counselled on \napplying for permanent residency. Information on applications for permanent residency \nby protected persons can be found in PP 4, section 7. \n \n21.11  Positive PRRA decision for A112(3) cases \nPRRA applicants who are either inadmissible on grounds of security (A34), human \nor international rights violations (A35), serious criminality (A36(1)), or organized \ncriminality (A37), or are excluded from refugee protection pursuant to section F of \nArticle 1 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees are described in \nsubsection 112(3) the IRPA, and as such, their access to protection is restricted.  \n \nAs per A114(1)(b), a PRRA application that is restricted per A112(3) will only result \nin granting a reviewable stay of removal instead of the conferral of protected \nperson status. The processing of these applications is governed by A113(d) and (e) \nand R172. In these cases, when IRCC finds that the applicant’s removal would not \nexpose them to risks under A96 and/or A97, their application is rejected and the \nfile is sent back to the CBSA regional office for removal proceedings.  \n \nWhen IRCC concludes that a PRRA applicant described in 112(3) would be at risk if \nremoved, the assessment is sent to the CBSA regional office along with the PRRA \napplication and the foreign national’s submissions. This is not a final decision but a \npreliminary assessment that should not be shared with the foreign national.  \n \nA restriction assessment is required to assess the danger the applicant poses to the \npublic and/or to the security of Canada, and/or of the nature and severity of acts \ncommitted against the risks they would face upon removal. In order to proceed \nwith the restriction assessment, the CBSA regional office must prepare supporting \ndocumentation to be forwarded to the CBSA Danger Assessments and National \nSecurity Cases Unit (DANSC) at CBSA NHQ.  \nCBSA officers may consult ENF 28 or DANSC for additional guidance.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n57 \n \nOnce a final decision is rendered by the IRCC, the CBSA officer delivers the decision \nin person.  If the PRRA application is rejected the removal proceedings may \ncontinue. If the application is allowed a stay of removal is granted. As per A114(2), \nsuch stays are subject to review to determine whether the circumstances \nsurrounding a stay have changed and the cancellation of the stay is justified. The \nperson should be counselled on the Minister’s authority pursuant to 114(2) to re-\nexamine the circumstances surrounding the stay of the removal.  \n \nMore information can be found on the IRCC Program Delivery Instructions. \n \n \n21.12  Negative PRRA decision \nAt the interview, the person will be advised of the negative decision. The person will \nbe counselled on the benefits of voluntary removal and advised that departure from \nCanada is now imminent. Attention must be given to the type of removal order, and \nthe person should be counselled accordingly on its effect. For information on \ncounselling regarding the effect of removal orders, see section 9. Based on the \ninterview and case details, the officer should assess whether the person will \nvoluntarily report to a specified location for removal on a specified date or whether the \nperson should be detained for removal. \nGCMS and NCMS should be updated regularly to capture all events throughout the \nPRRA process. \n \n \n21.13 Application for leave and judicial review of a  \n                  negative decision \nA decision by a PRRA officer may be judicially reviewed if the Federal Court grants leave \nto do so. The filing of the application for leave with the Court does not automatically \nstay a removal order. Usually a motion for a stay and a request that this motion be \nheard on an urgent basis will accompany the application for leave. For detailed \ninformation on the steps to take when a motion for a stay has been filed, see ENF 9, \nsections 5.25 to 5.28. \nIf a motion for a stay has been denied and the application for leave is proceeding, the \nremoval will not be deferred pending the Court's decision on the leave application. \n \n21.14  Subsequent PRRA applications \nA person who receives a negative PRRA decision cannot apply for a subsequent PRRA \nas per paragraph 112(2)(c), if less than 12 months has passed since their last \napplication for protection was rejected or determined to be abandoned or withdrawn, \nor in the case of a national from a country that is designated under subsection \n109.1(1), less than 36 months has passed*. Persons who remain in Canada following \nthe aforementioned time periods, may make another application. The application and \nwritten submissions must be forwarded to the PRRA coordinator. If the subsequent \napplication is submitted directly to the removal officer, it must be forwarded to the \nattention of the PRRA coordinator. Pursuant to R165, a subsequent application does \nnot result in a stay of removal and removal arrangements can proceed. In limited\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n58 \n \ncases, exceptional circumstances may warrant the deferral of removal pending a \nsubsequent PRRA decision. In these cases, the officer conducting the removal should \nconsult their supervisor or manager on whether the removal should be deferred.  \nGCMS and NCMS should be updated regularly to capture all events throughout the \nPRRA. \n*In 2019, Canada removed all countries from the designated country of origin (DCO) \nlist, effectively suspending the DCO policy, introduced in 2012, until it can be repealed \nthrough future legislative changes. \n \n \n22 \nProcedure: Obtaining travel documents \nPrior to initiating a request for a travel document, officers should ensure the case is \nactionable as per section 9.5 above. Actionable implies that the person’s location is \nknown, that reasonable grounds exist to believe the individual can be removed within \na reasonable time should a travel document be obtained, and PRRA notification has \nbeen given, if applicable.  \nOfficers should make prompt and reasonable efforts to determine the foreign \nnational’s citizenship, or country of legal residence if different, for the purpose of \nacquiring a travel document and executing the removal order expeditiously. \nOfficers should first determine if a travel document is on file, by doing the following: \n \nquery GCMS, NCMS, and the foreign national’s file for the existence of an \noriginal travel document or photocopy; and  \n \nreview the foreign national’s physical files for documentary evidence of \ncitizenship and  determine whether a formal application for a travel document \nhas been submitted earlier in the enforcement process.  \nIf a valid travel document is available, officers should action the file to effect removal \nwithout delay. \nWhen required, travel documents for foreign nationals under a removal order can be \nobtained through diplomatic representatives accredited to Canada. To identify the \nproper diplomatic representation, officers should consult the Removals Wiki, the \nStakeholder Engagement Unit (SEU), or Global Affairs Canada’s list of foreign \nrepresentations and international organizations accredited to Canada. \nEach diplomatic representation requires a variety of information and documentation. \nOfficers should consult with the SEU, the Removals Wiki, and / or the appropriate \ndiplomatic representation to confirm the requirements.  \nIn cases where a country’s accredited representation is their Permanent Mission to the \nUnited Nations (PM), officers should consult its website to determine if the PM has the \nauthority to issue travel documents before contacting them directly. When requesting \ndocumentation from diplomatic representations, officers should always request the \nmaximum permissible validity period for the travel document to allow for some \nflexibility in making removal arrangements. Although each country may have specific \nrequirements when applying for a travel document, requests for travel documents \nfrom diplomatic representations should normally include:\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n59 \n \n \nthe foreign national's: \no \ncomplete name, any aliases, date and place of birth, and any other \nrelevant particulars such as education and employment history; \no \nlast place of residence in the country of citizenship or legal residence;  \no \ndate of arrival in Canada, and; \no \nwhere countries specifically require:  \n \nparents’ names, places and dates of birth, present and / or past \naddress(es), and similar details, where known, of other family \nmembers or close relatives residing in the country of \ncitizenship;  \n \nnames, place, where applicable, clan or tribal information;  \no \na copy of the removal order. When the removal order is based on \ncriminality, officers should provide details of all known convictions; \no \npassport photographs, as per country’s specifications, one to be \ncertified on the reverse to the effect that it is a true likeness of the \nperson concerned; \no \nall identification documents such as, but not limited to: an expired \npassport, national identification card, seaman's identity card, birth or \nbaptismal certificate, laissez-passer or any other pertinent documents \nthat might help in establishing the citizenship of the foreign national \nconcerned (it is recommended to keep a copy on file of all \ndocumentation sent to the diplomatic representation);  \no \nif the previous passport was lost or stolen, a copy of the police report, \nor a statutory declaration from the foreign national in the event that a \npolice report is not available; and,  \no \nany other relevant file information (i.e., itinerary, legal name change, \netc.). \n \n \nIn exceptional circumstances, while conducting escorted removals, inland enforcement \nofficers may be asked to engage foreign governments to facilitate travel document \nissuance or confirmation of identity. Any engagement with foreign government \nofficials during escorted removals must be pre-approved by regional management and \nthe Removals Program Unit, and conducted in consultation with the SEU and \nInternational Network responsible for the CBSA LO Network. Any action must be \nclearly documented using standard note taking procedures and added to the foreign \nnational’s file. Furthermore, this activity must be declared to the diplomatic \nrepresentation when submitting the request for a visa to conduct the escorted \nremoval, to allow them to issue the correct visa. \n \n22.1 Obtaining travel documents for detained \n \nforeign nationals \nIt is the CBSA’s duty to remove inadmissible foreign nationals as soon as possible. \nTherefore, to avoid prolonged detention, officers must make arrangements to obtain \ntravel documents as quickly as possible.  \nOfficers should make prompt and reasonable efforts to determine the detained foreign \nnational’s citizenship, or country of legal citizenship if different, for the purpose of \nacquiring a travel document and executing the removal order expeditiously. For \ndetained cases, where there is an identified travel document impediment, officers \nshould reach out immediately to SEU for guidance. In most cases, officers will proceed\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n60 \n \nas usual to submit the request to the diplomatic representation and responsibility for \nthe file remains with them. SEU will work closely with officers and monitor progress to \nbe ready to intervene with the diplomatic representatives, if required. \nWhen officers correspond with a diplomatic representative, four points should be made \nclear: \n \na removal order has been issued; \n \nthe foreign national has exhausted all legal avenues to remain in Canada; \n \narrangements are being undertaken to obtain a travel document to reduce the \nperiod of detention to a minimum (if applicable); and \n \nofficer(s) will immediately inform the diplomatic representative if the removal \nwill not proceed as planned.  \nWhere possible, officers should apply in advance for a travel document as some \ndiplomatic representations will issue travel documents without travel itineraries. \nOfficers must give top priority to any correspondence pertaining to a detained foreign \nnational. They should either put a Detained Sticker [IMM 0476B] on each piece of \ncorrespondence that is sent to NHQ and to the IAD to alert them to the urgency of the \ncase, or note in the correspondence that the foreign national is detained.  \n \n22.2  Referrals to National Headquarters –  \n                 Stakeholder Engagement Unit \nIn cases where an officer is unable to obtain a travel document from a diplomatic \nrepresentation , the case may be referred to the SEU, who will take the lead on travel \ndocument efforts. This may include elevating the case with diplomatic representation, \nengaging Liaison Officers to take the necessary steps to resolve outstanding issues \nwith the relevant authorities, or seeking other solutions as required. In some cases, \nGlobal Affairs Canada may be asked to intervene if difficulties in obtaining the \nnecessary travel document persist. File referral information should be included in \nNCMS as per Operational Bulletin: PRG-2018-04.  \nAs a general rule, cases must be referred for assistance to the SEU where officers \nhave attempted to obtain a travel document and have received no formal reply from \nthe diplomatic representatives in 30 calendar days. This will allow foreign \nrepresentatives  a respectful amount of time to respond and/or complete any required \nverifications, and officers to work to resolve any issues at the regional level, \npreserving the relationship. If a regional program specialist is available, they are a \nvaluable resource that maybe able to assist in resolving issues, before referring the \ncase. Furthermore, only cases that are actionable should be referred, as per Part 8.5 \nabove. When there is an outstanding PRRA application, consideration should be given \nto the validity period of the travel document and the likelihood of removal proceeding, \nbefore pursuing travel document issuance and seeking SEU assistance. However, \nthere are cases / circumstances that require earlier SEU assistance and officers are \nencouraged to reach out to the unit for guidance / assistance. Examples of cases that \nshould be an immediate referral:\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n61 \n \n \ndetained \n \nwhere no identity / citizenship documentation is available to the CBSA; \n \nrefusal to comply with the travel document application; \n \nrequire confirmation of previous legal residency in a third country (permanent \nresident / convention refugee status); \n \nad hoc cases (i.e., countries where there is a clear indication from the \ndiplomatic representation that a travel document is not forthcoming, or \ncountries from which SEU can obtain fast confirmation of citizenship); and \n \ninvolve nationals of countries where SEU is the single point of contact.   \n \nWhen a case is referred to the SEU for assistance, SEU will assume the lead on \ncommunicating with the diplomatic representation on the travel document. However, \nthe officer remains responsible for the case and, therefore, is expected to continue the \nday-to-day activities and act as the principal contact for any information and/or action \npertaining to the case, unless specifically instructed otherwise by the SEU. In the \nevent that correspondence on the travel document is received from the diplomatic \nrepresentation, officers should forward it immediately to the SEU prior to responding. \nOfficers must inform the SEU immediately of any new developments in the case, \nespecially if an officer receives a travel document, or if the foreign national receives \nstatus in Canada, leaves the country or dies after having referred the case. \nWhen referring a case to the SEU, it is important that officers provide all necessary \nbackground information, this includes but is not limited to a copy of the application \npackage submitted, a case summary, and any follow up correspondence.  \n \n22.3  Removal without a valid passport \nIn cases where removal without a valid passport is a possibility, officers should review \nthe case, consult the Travel Information Manual (TIM), the Removals Wiki and SEU, \nand discuss it with their supervisor. In some cases, according to the TIM, a foreign \nnational may not require a valid passport to enter their country of nationality, but this \nshould be confirmed with the SEU as the rules for foreign nationals under removal \norder are different than those that apply to regular travelers. Before officers remove a \nforeign national who does not have a valid passport or travel document, they will need \nthe concurrence of the transportation carrier and any country of transit. \nAn officer of the destination country will usually grant admission to a foreign national \nupon satisfaction that the person is a citizen or national of that country. An expired \npassport, birth certificate, national identification card, or any other recognized \ndocument that contains biographical details of the person may serve as evidence of \ncitizenship and could be sufficient; however, the final determination is that of the \nreceiving country. Officers should consult the Removals Program Management Unit and \nthe International Network prior to scheduling the removal.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n62 \n \n22.4  Removal without a travel document \nAlthough it is not recommended to proceed with a removal without proper \ndocumentation, a transportation carrier may accept a foreign national under removal \norder without documentation if the foreign national is being removed directly back to \nthe country of origin and there are no transit points. Before finalizing travel \narrangements, the carrier should be contacted to verify that this is acceptable, and \nofficers should be confident that the destination country is willing to accept the \ndeportee without documents. A Single Journey Document (SJD) [IMM 5149B] should \nbe completed and used only after the destination country has confirmed that their \nnationals can travel on a SJD. It is necessary to consult the Stakeholder Engagement \nUnit (SEU) for guidance when travel documents are not available and seek approval to \nproceed with an SJD.     \n \n22.5  Use of a Single Journey Document (SJD) \nA SJD should be used only in exceptional circumstances when it is not possible to \nobtain a travel document or remove an individual on an alternative document. Officers \nshould regard the use of an IMM 5149B as an exception to the rule, not as a standard \noperating procedure. As such, the decision to use an IMM 5149B must be made on a \ncase-specific basis, taking into account all possible complications including the \nrequirements of transit countries. Officers should always seek the concurrence of their \nmanager before removing on an IMM 5149B. Once regional managers are satisfied \nthat an SJD is warranted, managers are to seek approval from SEU. This document \ndoes not guarantee entry into the destination country, and officers should be aware \nof, and plan for, the potential for a person being refused entry into that country. \nAlthough there is not a list of countries that accept persons removed on an IMM \n5149B, officers should consult the Removals Wiki for country specific information \nabout the use of SJDs.  \n \nThe narrative report should include: \n \n \nname and UCI of the foreign national; \n \nthe reason the IMM 5149B will be utilized; \n \nthe proposed date of removal, itinerary and name of the transportation \ncompany; \n \nthe reason for removal; \n \nthe number of escort officers to accompany the foreign national and, if \ndetermined at time of reporting, their names; \n \nany available supporting documentation such as a birth certificate or \nexpired document;  \n \nconfirmation that the foreign national is removal ready and has \nexhausted all legal venues to remain in Canada; \n \nconfirmation whether or not the foreign national is willing to return to the \ndestination country; \n \npertinent information regarding the foreign national’s health status; and  \n \nany other information that may be useful, including information about the \nprevious successes using SJDs for this particular country. \n \nFor further information on the escort requirements for the removal of persons on an \nIMM 5149B, refer to PART IV below.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n63 \n \n22.6  Visa requirements \nWhen a foreign national is required to transit a country where a visa is required, \nofficers must acquire the necessary visa before the foreign national is removed from \nCanada. Additionally, some countries may require re-entry visas or authorizations for \ntheir nationals, permanent residents, or protected persons being removed back to \ntheir countries, which officers will have to obtain.  \nFor specific requirements, officers should refer to the TIM, the Removals Wiki, IRCC \nOfficial Travel, and should consult the Removals Program Management Unit. In some \ncases, it may be necessary for officers to contact the diplomatic representation \ndirectly, or as a last resort, confirm visa requirements with the liaison officer. \n \n23 Procedure: Seizure of documents  \nA140(1) authorizes an officer to seize and hold any means of transportation, \ndocument or other thing if the officer believes, on reasonable grounds, one of the \nfollowing: \n \nthat the means of transportation, document or other thing has been \nfraudulently or improperly obtained or used; \n \nthat seizure is necessary to prevent its fraudulent or improper use; or \n \nthat the seizure is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act and \nRegulations. \n \nRefer to ENF12 manual for detailed guidance on the seizure of documents.    \nWhen arranging the removal of a foreign national from Canada, the officer should \nreturn any genuine identity or travel documents to the rightful holder and/or return all \nseized documents issued by any government department or agency to the appropriate \nissuing authority. For further instructions on the procedure for disposing of seized \ndocuments refer to ENF 12. \n \n \n24 Procedure: Subsistence for persons under a  \nremoval order   \nFor the purpose of this document, subsistence is defined as “a means of surviving”. \nIn exceptional circumstances, the CBSA manager, Director, or Regional Director \nGeneral have the discretion to approve for the foreign national's subsistence or the \nmeans to buy it. Subsistence funds are meant to assist the individual with funds for \nnecessities, if needed, to facilitate their removal to their destination country.   \nWhere subsistence funding for transportation is required, it should always be limited \nto one trip, by the most cost-effective means, in order to facilitate the person to \naccess government services, or to be reunified with a support network.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n64 \n \n24.1  Preparing the rationale \nIf the officer determines that it is necessary to provide subsistence funds to a foreign \nnational, the officer must prepare a rationale to seek approval. Officers should \nconsider the following factors: \n \nFamily, friends, support network  \n \nMedication \n \nLuggage (or lack thereof) and proper attire for travel \n \nAvailability of funds \n \nReception at destination airport  \n \nTransportation \n \nCurrency value \n \nPrevious status in Canada \n \nCurrent living situation in Canada \n \nIf detained, availability of funds at the financial institution and/or stored at the \nprovincial detention centre \n \n \n24.2 \n Requesting subsistence funds  \nIn order to request subsistence funds the officer is required to:  \n \nComplete the rationale and seek approval from the manager with the \nappropriate financial authority. The manager level must have at least a Level V \ndelegated spending authority under the CBSA’s Delegation of Spending and \nFinancial Authorities (DSFA) Matrix. \n \nIf the amount is under $500 CAD, the request should be approved by the \nManager (Level V and above).  \n \nIf the amount is between $500 CAD - $2,000 CAD, the request should be \nreferred to the Director for approval.  \n \nIf the amount requested exceeds $2,000 CAD, the request should be escalated \nto the Regional Director General for approval. \n \nThe officer will complete a Petty Cash Voucher Form [GC34] to have the funds \nissued as a Petty Cash Voucher. \n \nRegardless of the amount requested, the GC34 request form must clearly articulate \nthat the purpose of the requested funds is for the provision of subsistence funds, \ninclude the foreign national’s name, UCI, and the expected removal date.  \n \n24.3  Releasing subsistence funds \nA Statutory Declaration must be completed by the officer releasing the funds to the \nforeign national. \nFor unescorted removals, the officer will provide the funds to the foreign national \nwhen they are departing Canada (e.g. at the airport gate) and have the foreign \nnational sign the statutory declaration confirming receipt of the funds.   \nDuring an escorted removal, the officers will provide the subsistence funds to the \nforeign national and have the foreign national sign the statutory declaration \nconfirming receipt of the funds.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n65 \n \nA record of issuance of the subsistence funds will be maintained by placing a copy of \nthe statutory declaration on the foreign national’s file. \n \n \n24.4  Tracking subsistence funds \nThe following activities are required to maintain clear records of subsistence funds \nissuance: \n \nThe Officer is responsible to attach a copy of the signed GC34 form to the file, \nas well as a copy of the Statutory Declaration.  \n \nThe Regional Finance Section is responsible for maintaining records of released \nsubsistence funds. \n \n \n \n25  Procedure: Medical Requirements necessary for \nRemoval (MRR) \nWhen making removal arrangements for a foreign national who has ongoing medical \nissues, the CBSA must ensure that the individual has the proper medical assistance \nduring removal. As officers are not trained in the medical field, they must seek a \nmedical opinion from a licensed physician to determine if any medical assistance is \nrequired for/during travel in accordance with the International Aviation Transport \nAssociation medical manual. \nMRR requests must be forwarded to the MRR Unit inbox accompanied by all relevant \ninformation, pertaining to the medical condition(s) with supporting documentation and \nconsent forms. The MRR Unit will forward the requests to the CBSA Medical \nPractitioner. The CBSA Medical Practitioner will provide an assessment within 48 hours \nof the request. The MRR Unit will send the assessment to the requesting officer within \n24 hours (excluding weekends) of receipt. Should a backlog of requests occur, MRRs \nwill be issued based on the removal date.  \nWhile a MRR assessment may result in a short term deferral of removal, foreign \nnationals who allege that removal may cause death or irreparable harm due to a lack \nof critical medical care in the country of removal are, in fact, requesting to stay in \nCanada indefinitely. The responsibility to decide on long term risk falls outside of \nCBSA’s mandate. The discretion that a CBSA officer may exercise is very limited, and \nin any case, is restricted to when a removal order will be executed.  \n \n \n26 \nProcedure: Notifying commercial transporters - \nTransporter liability (Air and Marine Mode)  \nUnder R276(1)(b) officers must inform the commercial transporter liable for removal \nas soon as a removal order becomes enforceable. Officers should also provide \nbackground details in the advance information so that the commercial transporters \ncan conduct any necessary investigations before removal.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n66 \n \nIf the commercial transporter responsible for removal are air carriers, the information \nfrom the officer should also include, whenever possible, a photocopy of the original \nairline ticket, inbound ticket numbers, routing to Canada, other carriers involved en \nroute, flight numbers and dates. These details will assist in the carriers' acceptance of \nliability and help them to prorate removal costs to any other carriers involved. \nOfficers should use the Notice to Transporter [BSF502] to serve notice officially to a \ncommercial transporter of its responsibility to convey the person back to their country.  \nOnce the officer has established a travel itinerary, the officer presents the BSF502 to \nairline officials for signature. \nNote that there are circumstances where commercial transporters are relieved of their \nobligations to carry a FN from Canada (refer to R277). \n \n \n27 Procedure: Notification to LOs and RCMP of all \ncases \nThe following two subsections provide details concerning notification prior to removal. \n \n27.1 Notification to liaison officers (LOs) at visa \noffices abroad \nRemoval officers must notify liaison officers, as per the Mission Territory List, of all \nknown removals arriving in or transiting their countries of responsibility. This includes \nescorted removals, airline liability cases, and non-escorted cases who confirm their \ndeparture. \nThe LOs must be given this information to advise other government officials and police \nof the returning individual as required. The visa office general mailbox should also be \ncopied to ensure the notification is read if the LOs are away. As well, if a specific \ncountry does not have LO coverage at the time of the removal, please notify the IRCC \nimmigration program manager of the Canadian Embassy or High Commission that \nserves that country. \nFor full information including country-specific instructions as well as the list of the \noffice addresses, fax numbers, telephone numbers and territory responsibilities of LOs \noverseas, officers should consult the Notification of Removals Mission Territory List, \nand the LO Contact List at: Liaison officers contact list. \nIt is imperative that officers send the notification and the BSF834 Notification of \nRemoval Form to the post at least seven working days before the proposed removal. \nIf the information cannot be sent within seven working days, officers must notify the \nLO as soon as possible to prevent difficult situations from developing and to ensure \nthat any necessary assistance will be available. \nNotification should stipulate whether it is being sent for information only, or if assistance is required in \neither the transit country or country of destination.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n67 \n \nThe notification should contain the following information: \n \nnames; \n \ndates of birth; \n \npassport numbers of escort officers, including police and/or medical officers; \n \nthe full given name, family name and aliases of the foreign national being removed; \n \nthe foreign national's date of birth, citizenship, place of birth; \n \na description of the foreign national and a photograph; \n \nthe type, serial number and validity period of the travel document; accompanying \nidentification documents; \n \nthe date of the removal order and the IRPA violation under which the removal order was \nissued; \n \nthe proposed date of removal, itinerary and name of the transportation company; \n \nany criminal or terrorist background and whether the foreign national has a history of \nviolence; \n \nthe attitude of the foreign national concerning their removal (for example, whether the \nforeign national is likely to resist forcibly); \n \nif a medical case, the nature of the medical condition; \n \nany assistance from foreign authorities that is expected during transit; \n \ninformation on accompanying family members; and \n \nany other information that may be useful. \n \nNotifications should be forwarded to the Liaison Officers, the Mission’s generic inbox as well as the \nremovals notification inbox found on the Wiki, who will disseminate the removal notification to the \nRemovals Program Unit, Stakeholder Engagement Unit, International Operations Division, and Quality \nAssurance Unit. Please also be reminded of the following: \n \nThe BSF834 must always be included in each removal notification. \n \nThe following format should be used in the subject line of your email for consistent screening \nand follow up: Escorted or Unescorted removal of LAST NAME, First Name UCI: XXXX-XXXX to \n(Country) on (Date). \n \nNotifications must be sent at least seven working days in advance of the removal, or longer if \nspecified by the country. \n \nLOs and Missions emails can be found at: Liaison officers contact list. \n \nIt can happen that the 7 day mandatory removal notification period may not be met for walk-ins but \nall efforts should be made to meet this timeline for any other case. Some countries have longer \nnotification periods, which is indicated on the country's WIKI page. \nIf a removal is delayed or cancelled, the officer must notify the visa office immediately. If necessary, \nfurther information should be sent regarding the specific reasons for the delay or cancellation and \nwhether further action is required. \nFurthermore, the Removals Unit must provide written instructions to officers confirming the departure, \nof action to be taken if a foreign national does not appear for a removal for which the overseas offices \nwere notified. For these cases, the BSF582 (Envelope: Removal Documents), must include the \nappropriate LO contact information (name, post, e-mail, fax and telephone numbers). \nWhen a foreign national did not appear for removal, the officer must contact the necessary LOs as \nsoon as possible, with a copy to the responsible Removals Unit. The method of notification is at the \nofficer’s discretion, based on the timing and the circumstances of the case, e.g., e-mail, and/or \ntelephone. This will allow the LO, and ultimately the CBSA, to maintain good relations with local \nauthorities in both transit and destination countries.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n68 \n \n27.2  INTERPOL notification \nPrior to removal, enforcement officers must notify the RCMP via INTERPOL, Ottawa, of the removal of \nan individual who: \n \nhas a serious Canadian criminal record; \n \nhas a serious foreign criminal record; and \n \nis wanted by a foreign country (active red notice or diffusion). \n \nEnforcement officers should include the following information when notifying INTERPOL Ottawa: \n \nall first names, last names and assumed names of the person being removed; \n \ndate and place of birth, citizenship and address in the country of origin; \n \nphysical description of the person removed and photograph; \n \ntype, serial number and valid period of travel documents; \n \nFPS number; \n \nidentity documents attached to the travel documents; \n \ndate of the removal order and the violation under which the removal order was issued; \n \ndate of removal, the itinerary and the name of the carrier; \n \ncriminal and terrorist background as well as any violence history of the foreigner, if \napplicable; \n \nnature of illness or condition, if medical attention is required; \n \nassistance (if required) by foreign authorities during the transit; \n \ninformation on accompanying family members, if applicable; \n \nnames and dates of birth of the escorting officers, if applicable; \n \npassport numbers of the escorting officers, including police officers and medical staff, if \napplicable; and \n \nother pertinent information. \n \nRCMP INTERPOL Operations in Ottawa can be reached by telephone at (613)-843-5034 or by email \n(preferred) at ipottawa@rcmp-grc.gc.ca. \n \n \n28 \nProcedure: Fingerprinting at time of removal \nWhen a person is under a deportation order, or a departure order that has become a deportation \norder, the officer conducting the pre-removal interview will capture their fingerprints and photograph, \neven in cases where the fingerprints and photograph are already on file. This process may be \ncompleted up to 90 days prior to removal. Officers are to use LiveScan automated fingerprint systems \nwherever they are available, with ink and roll prints only being used when a LiveScan machine is not \navailable. \n \nOfficers will be utilizing the CAR-Y workflow and when completing the “Demographic Entry - Statute of \nthe Charge” section, the officer will select the IRPA authority from the dropdown menu. The officer will \nthen select “Other” in the “Section Number and Wording” section and then enter “Removal – \nDeportation Order” in the “Charge Description 1”. \n \nWhen fingerprints are captured and ready to be submitted, the officer will print 3 copies of the C-216. \n  \nOne copy will be inserted into the person’s file, another will form part of the Previously Deported \nPerson package that is sent to the Warrant Response Centre, and the third form will ultimately be\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n69 \n \nforwarded to the RCMP. The RCMP requires the CBSA to enter the date when the removal from Canada \noccurred and the destination country. \nWhen preparing the PDP package, the officer will include the information below in the Disposition \nsection of all three C-216 forms. \n \n \na) Removal Order Authority – Section 48 of IRPA CBSA Removed on: ddmmmyyyy \n \nb) Destination Country: \n \nWhen forwarding the PDP package to the Warrant Response Centre, the officer will also insert the C-\n216 copy for the RCMP. The Warrant Response Centre will be responsible for ensuring data quality, \nbatching the C-216 for the RCMP and forwarding them to the RCMP for insertion in the Real Time \nIdentification System. \n \n \n29  Preparing the Confirmation of Departure envelope \nAfter an officer notifies the foreign national that a removal order has become enforceable and the \nofficer has determined whether the person can be removed through voluntary compliance or an \nenforced removal order, a Confirmation of Departure (COD) envelope must be prepared. When \npreparing the COD package, officers should: \n \nPrepare a Certificate of Departure [IMM0056B], and ensure a copy of the foreign national’s \nphotograph is affixed to the CBSA copy of the document; \n \n \ncomplete a Notice of Removal and Profile (BSF560); \n \n \ninclude copies of any airline security notifications and approval; \n \n \ninclude travel document and airline ticket; and \n \n \ncopy of Direction to Report. \n \nIf the removal is taking place at an airport and transportation has been arranged, the package may be \nforwarded to the airport. \n \nPART IV – Escorted Removals   \nThis section is currently under review.  \n \n30  Procedure: Administrative travel guidelines for officers \nperforming escorts \nThe Treasury Board of Canada travel directive is an important document for Government of Canada \nemployees who travel on government business or arrange for those who travel. \nManagement and officers can locate the travel directives at the following Web site: National Joint \nCouncil (NJC) Travel Directive. In addition, this policy is to be read in conjunction with ENF 20 \n(Transport Policy, Section 11.5), the Agreement between the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat \nand the Public Service Alliance of Canada for the Border Services (FB) Group (Collective \nAgreement),the Use of Force Policy Suite and the Identifying and reporting significant events policy.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n70 \n \n31 Procedure: Defining and measuring risk \nIn cases where the PS Minister must enforce the removal order, a decision may be required whether or \nnot the individual being removed requires an escort. The final decision of the need to escort and the \naccountability for the decision following the assessment of the need for escorts rests with either the \nsupervisor, manager or in some cases, the director. \nIn the context of escorted removals, risk is measured by the uncertainty that the person under \nremoval may, during the removal, endanger the safety and security of the person(s) being removed, \nthe travelling public, transportation company personnel and/or the officer(s) conducting the removal. \nAs a minimum, some form of quantitative or qualitative analysis is required for making decisions \nconcerning threats to officers, airline personnel and the travelling public; risk that the foreign national \nwill self-harm; or the risk of resistance that will result in the failure of the removal. \nFor each element of risk, two calculations are required: its likelihood or probability (the chance of the \nrisk happening); and the extent of the impact or consequences (the amount of loss, damage or injury \nif an event happens or occurs). \nThe resulting “rating” determines the level of risk. The tables below provide guidance for measuring \nthe likelihood and impact of risk. \n \n31.1 \nLikelihood Scale \nLikelihood \nDescription \n \nVery Likely \nAlmost certain to happen during removal. \n \nLikely \nProbably will happen or chances are about even. \n \nUnlikely \nProbably will not happen. \n \n \nImpact Scale \nImpact \nConsequence \n \nMajor \nSignificant consequences: Serious injury or fatality; extensive psychological \ntrauma; major property or economic damage; major confrontation or significant \ndisturbance. \n \nModerate \nMedium consequences: Limited damage or minimal long-term consequences; \nminor injury; moderate emotional distress; some disturbance that may result in \nthe failure of the removal. \n \nMinor \nNegligible or short-lived consequences: Slight disruption that does not result in \nthe failure of the removal; Minor non-compliance or issue of insignificant concern \nto public; Mild emotional distress.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n71 \n \n1) Rating the Level of Risk \nOnce the likelihood and impact of the risk is measured, the level of risk is rated using the Risk Matrix \nbelow. \n \n \n \nVery \nLikely \n \n \n \nMedium \n \n \n \nHigh \n \n \n \nExtreme \n \n \n \nLikely \n \n \n \nLow \n \n \n \nMedium \n \n \n \nHigh \n \n \n \nUnlikely \n \n \n \nLow \n \n \n \nLow \n \n \n \nMedium \n \n \nMinor \n \nModerate \n \nMajor \nImpact \n \n \nBased on the level of risk identified in the risk matrix, the table below provides guidance on the \nrequirement for escorts. \nRating \nImpact on Safety/Security \nExtreme \n \nEscorts are required and other strategies may be required to mitigate risk \ni.e., use of restraints, experienced officers, additional officer. \nHigh \n \nEscorts are required. \nMedium \n \nMay proceed with removal with or without escorts, with plans to mitigate risk \ni.e., direct flight, escorts to last transit point. \nLow \n \nEscorts are not required. \n \n \n2) Completing the Escort Risk Assessment/Escort Request Form [BSF512] \nSection 19 of this manual provides instructions on conducting the file review and pre-removal \ninterview. During the pre-removal interview, an assessment can be made of the foreign national’s \nbehaviour, comportment and their reaction toward their scheduled or imminent removal. \n \nIf the removals officer has determined through the file review and pre-removal interview that escorts \nmay be required, the removals officer must complete the Escort Risk Assessment/Escort Request Form \n[BSF512] and submit it to their Supervisor, Manager or Assistant Director, along with copies of \nsupporting documents and the foreign national’s file. \nLikelihood\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n72 \n \ni) Transportation Liability Cases \nPrior to completing the Escort Risk Assessment/Escort Request Form, the removals officer must review \nthe individual’s paper and electronic file to determine if the case is a Transportation Liability. If the \nremoval is a Transportation Liability, the Escort Risk Assessment/Escort Request Form [BSF512] is not \nrequired, unless the airline is no longer operating. Operating airlines must arrange their own escorts, if \nescorts are required. If the airline is no longer operating (and the removal expenses will be reimbursed \nfrom the airline’s security deposit, by invoice sent to the CBSA Transportation Obligations Unit), the \nremovals officer must indicate this on the form. Note that CBSA officers will only perform airline \nliability escorts in exceptional cases, following concurrence from the Manager or Assistant Director, or \nin cases where the airline is no longer operating. \n \nii) Medical and Facilitation Escorts \nIf the foreign national has a medical or mental health condition that requires supervision, a \ndetermination should be made by CBSA medical contractor whether a medical escort is required. The \nmedical contractor’s recommendation must be included, and if applicable, a Request for Medical Escort \nform, with the escort request. \n \n31.2  Escort Types \n \nAccompaniment Escort \nIf an escort is required strictly for facilitation purposes, such as the requirement of foreign \nadministration, airline, or transit point, and there is no risk identified to warrant a risk-based escorted \nremoval. \nRisk-based Escort \nWhen the individual who is to be removed presents a level of risk based on their criminal history or \nbehaviour. Risk to the safety and security of the airplane, the general public, and the individual being \nremoved are all factors that can lead to an escorted removal. \nTransport Escort \nOccurs when an individual under a removal order is being transported from one location to another \nwithin Canada, transported to the last departure point in Canada, or transferred by land to the United \nStates POE. Security guards contracted by the CBSA will do this work where services are available. \n \n \n32  Assessment of the need for escorts \nIn order to approve or deny a request for escorts, the Supervisor, Manager or Assistant Director \nreviews the information provided on the Escort Risk Assessment/Escort Request Form [BSF512] and \nsupporting documents. The Supervisor, Manager or Assistant Director also reviews the hard- copy file, \nand relevant CBSA systems. The most recent interview notes, detention review notes, police reports \nand sentencing reports on the file should be made available for review upon request. \nIn addition, the Supervisor, Manager or Assistant Director will discuss the request with the removals \nofficer and ask all pertinent questions in order to validate the information provided regarding the \nimpending removal, including that this information equates to the appropriate level of risk based upon\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n73 \n \nthe Risk Matrix. Factors to consider are the person’s comportment, anticipated reaction to their return \nto the country of destination, the length of the trip, and/or the transit point(s). \nThe objective of assessing the need for escorts is to minimize the risk to the safety and \nsecurity of the person(s) being removed, the travelling public, transportation company \npersonnel and/or the officer(s) conducting the removal. The role of the officer is to \ngather pertinent information on the case, identify possible risk, and recommend to their \nrespective managers, assistant directors or supervisors whether an escort is required. \nThe final decision on the need for escort rests with the manager, assistant director or \nsupervisor. Where it is determined that an escort is necessary, the following are \nimportant factors to consider in order to avoid unnecessary risk and ensure the success \nof the removal: \na) the number of officers required to effect the removal; \nb) the physical capability of the officers to restrain the individual should it \nbecome necessary; and \nc) the circumstances and locations in which the removal will take place. \n \n32.1 Determining the number of officers for escort \nThe determination of the number of escort officers to be assigned to the removal is \nmade by the Supervisor, Manager or Assistant Director (or in some cases, the Director), \nbased on the information provided by the removals officer, the information on file and \nthe escort risk assessment. \ni) \nAccompaniment Escorts \nIf an escort is required strictly for facilitation purposes, such as the requirement of \nforeign administration, airline, or transit point, and there is no risk identified to warrant \nan escorted removal, only one escort officer, of the same sex, is assigned to accompany \nthe foreign national to either the transit point or final destination. Two escort officers \nmay be assigned when the airline or foreign officials specify that removal with one \nescort officer is not acceptable and despite efforts, no other agreement can be reached. \nii) \nRisk-Based Escorts and Detained Transport Escorts \nWhen the level of risk is such that an escorted removal is warranted, the standard \nnumber of officers that are assigned to the removal is two. Three officers are only \nassigned to an escorted removal when absolutely necessary and in exceptional cases. \nAn additional officer may be required when there is an extreme risk of bodily \nharm/death or physical resistance. Prior to assigning three officers, consideration must \nbe made whether the risk may be mitigated by assigning two officers who are \nexperienced with controlling violent individuals, using additional restraints as permitted \nby the airline and transit authorities, or assigning officer(s) who have built a rapport \nwith the foreign national and have been able to control the foreign national through \ntactical communication. The length of the trip, including the length and number of \ntransits and availability of detention facilities should not be prescribed factors when \ndetermining whether three officers are required. \nOngoing Assessment of Risk \nThere are situations up until boarding the aircraft where new information or new \ncircumstances may warrant a re-assessment of risk. The decision to approve escorts \nmay be changed to a decision to proceed without escorts if the individual being\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n74 \n \nremoved is now compliant. It is the responsibility of the removals officer, assigned \nescort officer(s) to immediately bring the new information to the attention of the \nSupervisor, Manager or Assistant Director, for consideration. \n \n32.2  Examples of removal cases that may require \nan escort \nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of examples to assist in assessing the need for \nescorts. Two officers should be considered to escort an individual under the following \ncircumstances: \n \nthe individual has been charged with, or convicted of, a serious offence \ninvolving violence in any country. These offences may involve bodily harm \n(including death), weapons (including explosives), arson, hostage-taking, \nextortion, or acts against children; \n \nthe individual has demonstrated an unwillingness to be removed or has made \nverbal or written threats against anyone in regards to their removal and/or it \nis anticipated that violence or untoward behaviour will be exhibited during the \nremoval; \n \nthe individual has been deemed by the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship \nMinister to be a danger to the public; \n \nit is anticipated that problems may arise at the transit point or that the \nindividual will avoid connecting to the ongoing aircraft; and \n \nthe individual suffers from a medical condition which requires close \nsupervision and the individual poses a safety or security risk. For further \ninformation on medical escort cases, refer to procedure 24. \n \n32.3  Exceptional cases that may require an escort \nThe following are a few examples of exceptional cases in which an escort may be \nrequired: \n \nsituations in which an individual has been convicted of a minor assault. The \nnature of the assault and the potential for violence at the time of removal will \nbe the determining factors in these situations. If it is determined that an \nescort is required, two officers should be assigned; \n \ncases involving serious narcotic or drug convictions and the additional factors \nsuch as acts of violence or organized crime. The circumstances may vary \nfrom the need for no escort at all to the need for two officers. Individuals with \nminor narcotic or drug-related convictions will not normally be escorted \nunless there are indications that violence was, or may be, an issue; \n \ncases of serious criminal charges, particularly charges that are violence-\nrelated. In these cases, the individual should be escorted by at least two \nofficers. When the individual is wanted by law enforcement authorities in \nanother country for minor charges, the individual might need to be escorted \ndepending upon circumstances such as their willingness to leave or the \nanticipated reception the individual may experience upon arrival at the \ncountry of destination. There may also be other law enforcement \"liaison\" \nissues that need to be factored into the decision to escort;\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n75 \n \n \nindividuals whom the CBSA knows have escaped or attempted to escape the \nCBSA or police custody may not necessarily require an escort, particularly if \ntheir scheduled flight is non-stop. The rationale for this approach is that, if a \nperson appears at the airport voluntarily, then they are willing to leave \nCanada. However, if the individual has a repeated history of escape, or has \nmade recent attempts to escape, serious consideration should be given to \nescorting such an individual to their final destination. In such cases where it \nis determined that an escort is required, two officers should be assigned; and \nindividuals convicted of property-related or other offences involving non-\nviolent acts should not be escorted unless there are extenuating \ncircumstances determined in the risk assessment which warrant an escort. In \nsuch cases where it is determined that an escort is required, two officers \nshould be assigned. (Property-related offences may include such crimes as \ntheft, possession of stolen property, trespassing or fraud.) \n \n32.4  Escorts of multiple removals \nIn multiple removal cases, the air carrier reserves the right to limit the maximum \nnumber of passengers under escort, considering the size of the aircraft and the level of \ndanger involved.  \nis important, in these cases, that the air carrier is aware of the number of individuals \nbeing removed on one flight, the ratio of escorts to removals and the nature of the \ncases involved. \nThe following guidelines are suggested for CBSA liability cases in which the individuals \nare not considered to pose safety or security risks and do not fall within the parameters \nof the profiles outlined earlier: \n \n0 to 5 adults = no officer \n \n6 to 10 adults = 2 officers \n \n11 to 15 adults = 3 officers \n \n16 to 20 adults = 4 officers \n \nIn cases where the air carrier requests a variance in the number of officers provided, \nthe matter will have to be negotiated with the individual air carrier. The airlines should \nalso be reminded that the CBSA officer would be responsible only for cases where the \nCBSA is liable for costs. The responsibility for the escort of airline liability cases rests \nwith the airline, and these cases are not to be included in the calculation related to the \nabove profiles. \nOfficers are reminded that there will be situations that do not fall within the categories \nabove. It should therefore be understood that each case must be assessed in \naccordance with individual circumstances when determining the need for and the \nnumber of officers that may be required, bearing in mind the basic criteria outlined in \nthe profiles. The final decision on whether or not individuals should be escorted \nultimately rests with the manager or supervisor. \n \n32.5 Removals involving transit points \nOfficers are not automatically assigned to ensure connections at transit points. There \nmay be cases where CBSA officers are satisfied that there is no safety or security risk\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n76 \n \nand that the person wants to return, has all the necessary documentation, has made \npersonal reception arrangements at the destination, and will meet connecting flights at \nthe transit point. An officer’s presence should not normally be required in such cases. \nOne officer of the same sex should be assigned to accompany a person to their \ndestination where CBSA officers are satisfied there is no safety or security risk and the \nneed to accompany the person is dictated by transit requirements and/or the CBSA’s \nobligations to satisfy established arrangements or to meet certain requirements \nimposed by other parties such as other countries or transportation companies. \n \n32.6 Removal of minors \nIn instances where fewer than three children under the age of 16 years are \naccompanying adults, they will not be counted in the numbers for the assignment of \nofficers. However, if there are more than three children, an additional officer should be \nconsidered. \nUnaccompanied minors under the age of 13 should be removed with an accompaniment \nescort. Unaccompanied minors between the ages of 13 and 18 can be returned on \ndirect flights to their country of origin, without escort, where the airlines will accept \nresponsibility for the child during the trip and where no other safety and security risk \nexists. An officer should accompany children between the ages of 13 and 18 on non-\ndirect flights or on direct flights where the airlines cannot accept responsibility for the \nchild's care en route or where other safety or security risks exist. \nIn all cases of the removal of minors, reception with the family members or \nrepresentatives of government departments or agencies responsible for child welfare \nshould be arranged prior to departure. \n \n32.7 Removal of violent persons \nAn individual who has a serious violent criminal history or who otherwise meets a profile \nrequiring two officers should not normally be removed on the same aircraft with \nmultiple removals. However, should this become necessary, the airline should be \nconsulted and, if the airline agrees to the removal, two officers should be dedicated to \nthat removal alone, exclusive of other officers involved in the multiple removals. \n \n32.8 Removal with a Single Journey Document \nIn situations where persons are being removed on a Single Journey Document [IMM \n5149] to countries where this document has been previously used without any \nproblems, the CBSA officers should consult their supervisor or manager to determine \nthat there is no safety or security risk. If no such risk exists and it is anticipated that \nremoval will be successful using an IMM 5149B, an officer may not be required for \nescort. Whenever a person is removed on an IMM 5149B, the individual should be in \npossession of supporting documentation such as a birth certificate or national identity \ncard. For further information on when to use an IMM 5149B, refer to section 21.5. \nWhen an IMM 5149B is being used to remove a person to a specific destination for the \nfirst time, at least one officer of the same sex should accompany the individual being \nremoved.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n77 \n \nAn officer may not be required for removals through transit points where the person \nconcerned has an IMM 5149B and a visa, and the CBSA officers are satisfied there is no \nsafety or security risk. \nWhen a flight connection is necessary through a strategically important hub or \nconnection point , at least one officer of the same sex should be assigned to accompany \nthe person to the connection point only. \n \n32.9 Procedure: Medical escorts \nThe CBSA may allow a federal government medical officer to act as an escort only when \nremoval is at public expense and medical attention is required en route. Many removal \noffices employ the services of nurses from non-governmental organizations or \ncorrectional institutions, etc., to assist with cases that require medical attention. Refer \nto existing local office policy with respect to contracting this medical staff. \nDecisions respecting the need to escort persons with medical conditions should be \nguided by whether the individual will require close supervision and qualified medical \nassistance in order to undertake the journey to their final destination without posing a \nsafety or security risk. It may be necessary to assign two officers, in addition to the \nmedical personnel, depending on the circumstances. \nThe following general principles have been established as a guide in determining when \nto seek medical assistance with respect to escorting foreign nationals who have a \nhistory of violent behaviour, or foreign nationals who may become violent or create a \ndisturbance when removal is in progress. \nUnder no circumstances will any foreign nationals be taken to a physician solely for the \npurpose of being placed under sedation for removal from Canada. Where a foreign \nnational has been taken to a physician for some other legitimate medical reason, the \nphysician may address the question of sedation for removal as a secondary issue. If the \nphysician decides to prescribe medication, the foreign national concerned must be \nasked if he or she wishes to take such medication, and if not, no medication is to be \nadministered. The only exception is the psychiatric cases described below. \n \n32.10 Example of medical escort case \nCases in which medical treatment is being administered or the person is under \npsychiatric care or treatment in an institution or hospital usually involve: \n \nforeign nationals who are suffering from a medical condition that requires the \nadministration of drugs at regular intervals, or \n \nforeign nationals who are currently in mental or psychiatric institutions or \nhospitals. \nThe first situation is one in which medication will have been prescribed for treating \nmedical disorders (e.g., heart condition) that are considered serious enough to warrant \nthe presence of a physician or registered nurse during removal. The physician or nurse \nis present only for the purpose of administering medication and/or monitoring the \ncondition of the foreign national being removed from Canada. Any drugs administered \nare given to the patient of their own volition to treat the medical condition.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n78 \n \nThe second situation is one in which the foreign national being removed from Canada \nhas been institutionalized for psychiatric treatment and is probably being returned to \ntheir home country for the continuation of treatment (i.e., usually to a mental \ninstitution or hospital). The medication administered in these cases is a continuation of \nthe ongoing treatment prescribed by the psychiatrist or physician. \nIn either of these two situations, arrangements may be made for the removal from \nCanada of such foreign nationals under medical escort, if considered appropriate by the \nCBSA in consultation with the attending physician or psychiatrist. It will not be \nnecessary to refer such cases to NHQ for concurrence before finalizing travel \narrangements and effecting removal. \n \n33  Establishing emergency contacts \n \nTo be fully prepared when effecting a removal, officers should have the following \nemergency contact numbers with them: \na) the telephone number and address of the Canadian embassy in countries of \ndestination and transit, or the Canadian Embassy responsible for the country \nof destination; \nb) the telephone number, name and office address of the CBSA LO responsible \nfor the country of destination or transit; \nc) contact details for the Canadian regional office duty supervisor; and \nd) contact details for the 24-hour watch office of Global Affairs Canada. \nAfter regular working hours most Canadian offices abroad will automatically switch from \nthe local consular emergency number to the Global Affairs’ Watch Office. A small \nnumber of offices abroad will have emergency numbers that will activate a voice mail \nwhich should be checked regularly, while others have the calls directly re-routed to a \nduty officer cell phone. In cases where emergency assistance is required, officers may \nreach the Watch Office by calling (613) 996-8885 or 1-800-387-3124. It should be \nnoted that the correct country code prefix for Canada would be required for direct \ndialing from overseas, and the 1-800 number may not work outside North America. \n \n34 Dealing with air carriers \nAir carriers are required to comply with their existing flight safety and security \nprocedures, which can be stricter than existing internationally regulated procedures. \nWhen officers are required to escort a subject, all airlines must be advised of the \nfollowing information: \na) the identity of the passenger under escort; \nb) the flight details; \nc) the reason for the escort; and the risk assessment of the passenger \nunder escort as to safety or security.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n79 \n \nDuring some non-airline liability removal cases, an air carrier may insist that an officer \nor officers accompany a person despite the determination that the individual does not \nconstitute a safety or security risk. The airline has the final decision in these matters \nand can determine whom they will transport on their aircraft. Should the scenario arise, \nofficers are encouraged to explore alternatives, including the review of the travel \nitinerary, routing and airline availability. Officers should be assigned only in cases \nwhere no other appropriate alternative is available. \n \n34.1 Airline liability \nIndividual air carriers are responsible for making removal arrangements and providing \nescort officer(s) in situations where a transportation liability exists as described in ENF \n15 – Obligations of Transporters. However, there will be instances in which the airline \nrequests assistance in providing escort officers for the removal. Agreeing to such \nrequests should be the exception rather than the rule and any such case should be \nimmediately brought to the attention of the supervisor or manager. The primary \nconsideration in agreeing to assist the airlines must be based on the risk assessment. \nWhere a safety or security risk in removal has been determined, the person subject to \nthe removal must be escorted. If the supervisor or manager agrees to provide the CBSA \nstaff to effect the removal, there must be confirmation in writing regarding the \nagreement reached with the airline concerning the use of the CBSA officers. This \nagreement must also set out the expenses for which the airline will be liable. The letter \nwill be hand- delivered and served on a responsible representative of the airline. \n \n34.2 Using the document envelope  \nThe Removal Documents Envelope [BSF 582] is specially designed for safekeeping \npapers such as passports, travel documents and tickets for foreign nationals subject to \nremoval proceedings. The document envelope is addressed to the purser, who will \ninform the pilot. When making removal arrangements, the officer preparing the \ndocument envelope should take the following steps: \n \ncomplete the face of the envelope (full name, complete itinerary, etc.) and \nensure that a current photograph of the foreign national is attached to the front \nof the envelope for ready identification; \n \ngive the envelope and contents to the examining officer at the U.S. POE if the \nofficer is turning the foreign national over to the United States Customs and \nBorder Protection (USCBP); \n \ninstruct the escort to carry the foreign national’s envelope if the foreign national \nis being escorted to a destination or on part of the journey; \n \ninstruct the officer to hand the envelope to the purser on the aircraft, with \nverbal instructions on the contents if these differ from the pre-printed notice on \nthe face of the envelope, if the foreign national is unescorted or will no longer \nbe escorted after a transit point. \n \nAt the time of removal, officers must also brief the purser (either verbally or by a letter \nto the captain) and provide a copy of the Notice of Removal and Profile [BSF560]. The \nCBSA recognizes that the primary responsibilities of every airline captain are the safety \nof passengers and crew, and the security of the aircraft. Certain airlines may also have \na specific form that must be completed and provided to airline officials when escort(s) \nare present on an aircraft. In rare cases, a pilot will refuse to board a person based on\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n80 \n \nthe subject’s demeanour or from the information provided to the pilot. Should these \noccasions arise, the officers conducting the removal must rely on their communication \nskills to provide any additional information to the pilot \n that could affect the pilot’s decision. Often, a pilot’s initial determination may change \nonce further information is provided by the escorting officers. \n \n35 Arranging for escorts \nThe CBSA is responsible for arranging all overseas escorts, including escorts to the U.S. \nborder or, if circumstances indicate a need for special care, to the final destination in \nthe U.S. Efforts should be made to minimize the number and length of stopovers. \nThe itinerary of a foreign national who is being removed to the U.S. and requires special \ncare may include one or more stops within the U.S. before the final destination is \nreached. In this case, an officer should stay with the person until their final destination, \nor until the officer can leave the person in capable hands. Normally when a foreign \nnational requires special care, the officer will continue to the final destination. If the \nofficer requires ground assistance at any of the stopovers en route, the officer should \nask the airport authorities or officials of the USDHS at the airport involved. In special \ncare cases, unless the officer has already made appropriate arrangements for the \nperson's reception at an alternative location, the officer should not leave the foreign \nnational at any point other than the final destination. \nThe manager or supervisor must exercise discretion in deciding whether the foreign \nnational to be removed requires an escort(s) while en route to the final port of \ndeparture from Canada. The manager or supervisor should consider the following \nquestions: \na) Does the foreign national have a serious criminal background, or was the \nforeign national serving a sentence? \nb) Is the foreign national a potential escapee or considered a danger to the \npublic? \nc) Has the foreign national been previously removed? \nd) Is there evidence of mental health concerns? \ne) Is the foreign national under any special medication? \nf) \nAre there potential problems at transit points? \nIf the officer determines that the foreign national does not require an escort to another \npoint of departure, the officer should: \n \ng) book and confirm the connecting flight, preferably leaving on the same day; \n \nh) notify the responsible airlines; and notify Canadian officials at transit points. \nDetention increases costs and workload at the receiving port. If there is more than a \nthree-hour layover between connecting flights, or if the officer must detain the foreign \nnational overnight, the officer should include in the foreign national's documentation a \nsigned Order for Detention [BSF 304].\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n81 \n \n35.1 Removal arrangements prepared by other    \n        officers  \nOfficers making removal arrangements should give the escort(s) involved in the \nremoval written instructions outlining the nature of the case, the action required, \nrelevant documents and the foreign national's baggage and personal effects, if the \nofficer has custody of them. The instructions must contain the following information: \n \ncase history: a brief outline noting citizenship, age, basis for removal, \naccompanying family members, and whether the foreign national is being \nremoved or repatriated; \n \nflight arrangements: the flight number and carrier, port of departure and \ndeparture time; \n \ninstructions: if the foreign national is being escorted from the place of residence to the \nport of departure, escorting instructions must include dates, hours of departure, cities, \ntransfer points and stopovers; \n \ndocuments: passport and number, medical information, detaining order, Certificate of \nDeparture [IMM0056B], removal order, notice of removal profile and receipts for the \nforeign national's property placed in an Envelope: Removal Documents [BSF 582] ; \n \ncharacter of the person: information about the foreign national's attitude to removal, \nbehaviour in jail (in applicable cases), and any other information disclosed on file that \nmight be of assistance to the escorting officer; and return to duty: the hour and date on \nwhich the escorts are to report back. \n \n35.2 Advance notification to the port of departure \nWhen the foreign national who is being removed, escorted or not, transits at a port of departure in \nCanada, the officer making the removal arrangement should advise the port of the foreign \nnational's arrival at least two days in advance by facsimile or e-mail and follow up by telephone. \nSince the receiving port has had no prior contact with the individual, it will need all the useful \ninformation the officer can provide. International airlines often seek detailed information on foreign \nnationals being removed. \nThe following information should be included in the message: \n \nthe foreign national's file number; \n \nthe foreign national's description and sex; \n \nthe names and ages of all family members, if accompanying; \n \narrival and departure information; \n \ndetails of any previous detention; \n \nthe foreign national's mental attitude; \n \nthe reason for removal; \n \nwhether the foreign national is detained; and whether the foreign national will be \nescorted and, if so, the names of the escort(s).\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n82 \n \nThe foreign national will be carrying a Certificate of Departure [IMM0056B] with a photo affixed. \nThe receiving port can use the certificate to confirm that the foreign national is the subject of the \nremoval order. The officer should also arrange to have the foreign national's documentation placed \nin an Envelope: Removal Documents [BSF 582] and transferred from the first airline's purser to the \nconnecting flight's personnel. \n \n35.3 Luggage and personal finances  \nWhen the officer accepts the foreign national into custody, the institution or immigration station \nmay require receipts for the foreign national and the foreign national's effects. If so, the officer \nmust get a complete list of valuables, money or baggage belonging to the foreign national and see \nthat this list appears on the receipt. A copy should be retained and placed on file when the officer \nreturns to duty. \nOften, family members will bring in personal effects or funds to an inland removal office to assist \ntheir relative who is subject to removal. A written receipt should be provided. When these effects \nare returned at the completion of the escort, officers should obtain a signature from the person \nbeing removed to acknowledge that these effects have been returned. In the absence of a receipt, \nthe officer should record this information in their notebook. If an officer is not diligent in recording \nthe return of these personal effects and funds, then the CBSA or the officer could face claims of \ntheft or loss of effects. \nThe officer must ensure that the foreign national's baggage has been collected, that it accompanies \nthe foreign national when removal is effected, and that it is checked through to the final destination \nwhenever possible. \nWhenever possible, officers should pick up and cash any pay cheques belonging to the foreign \nnational and conclude all banking arrangements on behalf of the foreign national. Money should be \nexchanged, if possible. \nOfficers should advise foreign nationals under a removal order to limit their effects so as not to \nexceed the free baggage allowance limits imposed by transportation companies. Any excess to the \nbaggage allowance is the responsibility of the foreign national, and arrangements must be made to \nship excess belongings at their own expense. \n \n \n35.4 Escorts for removal via the U.S. \nImmigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) requires five days advance notice to approve requests for \nall transits of third country nationals. Unless officers make other arrangements with ICE, it is the \nCBSA’s responsibility to arrange for an escort for removal via the U.S. if the person must deplane in \nthe U.S. en route to a third country. This provision applies even if the airline does not require the \nperson under removal order to be escorted. \n \n \n35.5 Escorts for removal via countries other than the U.S.  \nThere are countries other than the U.S. that are frequently used as transit points and may also \nrequire the presence of an officer to facilitate the removal. A supervisor or manager may agree to \ndeploy escort officers when persons are removed via transit points, as the CBSA requires continued \naccess to these transiting hubs for the continued success of the removals program.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n83 \n \n \n \n35.6 Escort by transportation companies \nIf a transportation company is responsible for ensuring the departure of a foreign national from \nCanada, the company must make its own escort arrangements for travel outside Canada. \nIf the company does not offer an escort to a foreign national within Canada, it must be reminded in \nwriting of its legal obligation to convey such persons. If the transportation company continues to \nrefuse to provide an escort officer, officers may escort the foreign national, but expenses for the \nescort should be charged to the company (see ENF 15, section 5.1). \nAside from escorting foreign nationals to U.S. ports of departure to third countries, only in \nexceptional circumstances will an officer escort a foreign national outside Canada to accommodate a \ntransportation company. \nThe arrangements and all removal and escort costs must be clearly documented and accepted in \nwriting by the airline. \n \n \n \n36 Taking precautions to prevent escape \nThis section provides details on taking safety precautions to prevent escape and using holding \ncentres or cells when transiting Canada. \n \n36.1 Taking safety precautions \nOfficers must exercise every caution to prevent the escape of foreign nationals in their custody, and \nmust decide whether handcuffs or other restraining equipment should be used according to the \ncircumstances. Officers should take the following precautions: \n \n \ndo not handcuff, chain or tape the subject to any immovable object while in transit; \n \nwhen transporting a foreign national by automobile, ensure that the foreign national is \nseated on the passenger side of the rear seat; \n \nif required a second officer must sit directly behind the driver; \n \ncheck the vehicle and surrounding area to ensure that there are no objects that could be \nused by the foreign national as a weapon; \n \nif the foreign national causes a disturbance during the removal, try to remove the foreign \nnational from public view as quickly as possible; \n \nwhen using public transportation, arrange if possible to enter the vehicle ahead of the \nother passengers, sit at the rear of the vehicle, and ensure that you and the subject are \nthe last passengers to disembark; and \n \ndo not linger with the foreign national in public places. \n \nthe officer(s) must remain alert at all times and always keep the subject in sight and at \nclose distance; \n \nif transportation is delayed, officer(s) should try to secure a room in the terminal away \nfrom the general public.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n84 \n \n36.2 Use of holding centres, cells when transiting through  \n        Canada \nOther regions can provide their cells or holding centres when officers are transiting a removal \nthrough Canada. Use of these facilities should be considered if: \n \nan officer is aware that there will be several hours before the onward flight to the \ndestination; and \n \nan officer experiences unforeseen delays before taking the onward flight. \n \nIf it is determined that a holding cell is required in these cases, officers should contact the CBSA \noffice at the transit point to obtain the procedures for admittance to a holding centre or cell, \nincluding instructions on the forms that must accompany the detention and release of the detainee. \n \n37  Actions to take upon escape or attempted escape \nThis section sets out the actions to take regarding escape or attempted escape from the custody of \nthe CBSA or the facilities of a transportation company, and the preparation of a Use of Force \nIncident Report [BSF586]. \n \n \n37.1 Escape or attempted escape from transportation  \n        company facilities \nIRPA provides for the prosecution of foreign nationals who escape or attempt to escape from lawful \ncustody or detention [A124(1)(b)]. \nOfficer(s) must take the following action immediately if a foreign national escapes from custody: \na) notify the police force of jurisdiction; \n \nb) notify the nearest CBSA manager or supervisor, who will in turn notify by e-mail or \nfacsimile the director of the region concerned. The e-mail or facsimile should give details \nof the identity of the foreign national and place of escape unless the officer is instructed \notherwise; \n \nc) enlist the help of other local officers to search the area thoroughly and provide any other \nassistance necessary; \n \nd) if the escape occurs outside Canada, notify the police force of jurisdiction and the \nnearest migration integrity officer for advice on how best to handle the situation in the \nlocal context; \n \ne) if the escape occurs in the U.S., notify the nearest USCBP or ICE officer and the manager \nof the Canadian port responsible for the case. The port manager will then notify the \nappropriate officials; \n \nf) \nthe officer should complete a Use of Force Incident Report [BSF586] by the end of their \nshift or as soon as reasonably practicable;\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n85 \n \ng) submit a full written narrative report to their manager or supervisor, providing details of \nevents leading up to the escape, the escape itself and action taken following the escape. \nAs soon as a complete investigation has been concluded, the manager or supervisor at \nthe port of origin must submit a full report to the area manager. The report must contain \nany observations or recommendations from the manager that may assist in determining \nthe cause of the escape and preventing future escapes through proper remedial action. \nThe area manager must forward the report with any necessary comments and \nrecommendations to the Director of Inland Enforcement; \n \nh) if the escapee is not located, the officer must issue a warrant under A55(1) and enter it \ninto CPIC, issue a lookout and update GCMS/NCMS immediately; and \n \ni) \nwhen the escapee is again placed in custody, the officer(s) must inform all authorities \npreviously notified of the escape. \n \n \n37.2 Escape or attempted escape from transportation  \n        company facilities \nIf a foreign national escapes from the custody of a transportation company’s facilities, the local \nCBSA manager must immediately: \n \nnotify the nearest municipal or provincial police and the RCMP; \n \nnotify by e-mail or facsimile the director of the region concerned. Details in the e-mail or \nfacsimile should include the identity of the foreign national, place of escape, name of the \ntransportation company responsible for the escapee, and the method of escape; \n \nobtain a written report on the escape from the transportation company or crew member; \n \nconduct a full investigation into the cause of the escape and all precautions taken by the \ntransportation company. If there is negligence or failure on the part of the transportation \ncompany to provide proper security or facilities, make recommendations for penalty \naction or any remedial action necessary to prevent future escapes; \n \nif an officer was involved, on returning to work, the officer should complete a Use of Force \nIncident Report [BSF586]; \n \nsend the report to the area manager, who will forward it with any necessary comments or \nrecommendations to the Director of the Inland Enforcement Division at the CBSA NHQ. \nThe officer must also ensure that a warrant is issued under A55(1) and entered into CPIC \nif the escapee is not located immediately; \n \nand input details of the incident into GCMS/NCMS immediately. \n \nIf the transportation company is at fault, the Director of the Inland Enforcement Division at the \nCBSA NHQ must write to the company advising it of its responsibility under IRPA and the \nRegulations, and that it is liable to a penalty. The transportation company has 30 days in which to \nshow cause why the penalty should not be imposed. The Director of the Inland Enforcement \nDivision at the CBSA NHQ will then send to the Director General a full report of the escape from the \ntransportation company's care or custody. This report must provide comments on the cause of the \nescape, the details of the escape itself, any remedial action that has been taken to prevent further \nescapes, and copies of all correspondence to the transportation company. \nThe CBSA NHQ will reply to any representations from the transportation company, informing it in \nwriting of the amount of the penalty when one is imposed and what action, if any, is required for an \nadditional security deposit. When the escapee is again placed in custody, all the authorities\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n86 \n \npreviously notified of the escape should be informed. \n \n38 \n Persons refused entry to another country \nOfficers should take appropriate action if a person was not granted lawful admission to another \ncountry. In these cases, the foreign national who has not met the departure requirements under \nR240 cannot be said to have enforced their removal order. \n \n \nPART V – Verifying Departure \n39 Confirmation of Departure \nA removal order should be enforced when the foreign national departs from Canada. This process is \nthe final step in confirming a person’s departure from Canada and recording that all of the \ndeparture requirements have been met. \nThere are three methods to confirm a departure of a foreign national from Canada as per IRPR. \n \nWhen the departure is verified at the POE \n \nR240(1) A removal order against a foreign national, whether it is enforced by voluntary compliance \nor by the Minister, is enforced when the foreign national \n(a) appears before an officer at a port of entry to verify their departure from Canada; \n(b) obtains a certificate of departure from the Canada Border Services Agency; \n(c) departs from Canada; and \n(d) is authorized to enter, other than for purposes of transit, their country of destination. \n \n \nWhen a removal order is enforced by an officer outside Canada \n(Canadian Mission) \n \nR240(2) If a foreign national against whom a removal order has not been enforced has departed \nfrom Canada and applies outside Canada for a visa, an electronic travel authorization or an \nauthorization to return to Canada, an officer shall enforce the order if, following an examination, the \nforeign national establishes that they are the person described in the order. \n \n \nWhen a removal order is administratively enforced by an officer in \nCanada \n \nR240(3) A removal order against a foreign national is enforced by an officer in Canada when the \nofficer confirms that the foreign national has departed from Canada.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n87 \n \nProcedures 39, 40, and 41 will describe how a removal order can be enforced for the above-\nmentioned three methods. \nNote: Under R242, persons who have been transferred under an order made pursuant to the Mutual \nLegal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act have not been authorized to enter their country of \ndestination. \n \n \n40  When the departure is verified at the POE – R240(1)  \nIn order for a removal order to become enforced on the person’s departure from Canada, R240(1) \nspecifies that a foreign national, regardless of voluntary compliance or removal by the Minister, \nmust take the following steps: \n \nappear before an officer at the port of entry to confirm their departure from Canada \n[R240(1)(a)]. Note: The designated authority to verify, at a POE, the departure of \nforeign nationals who are effecting their removal order can be found in the \nDesignation of Officers and Delegation of Authority documents in IL 3, item 200; \n \nobtain a Certificate of Departure (IMM0056B) from the Department [R240(1)(b)]; \n \nphysically depart Canada [R240(1)(c)]; and \n \nhave been authorized to enter their country of destination (other than for transit \npurposes) [R240(1)(d)]. \nBefore departure is verified, any outstanding warrants must be concluded, as appropriate. Officers \nshould follow instructions in ENF 7 on executing and cancelling warrants. In all cases where a \nwarrant is concluded, officers must contact the local office that issued the warrant. \nIf a foreign national subject to a departure order departs from Canada without complying with the \nrequirements under R240(1)(a), R240(1)(b) and R240(1)(c) and reappears before an officer at a \nPOE within the applicable period, the officer should enforce the removal order as a departure order. \nIn these cases, the person is appearing before an officer at a port of entry to verify their departure \nand must comply with all the requirements set out in R240(1)(a), R240(1)(b) and R240(1)(c). In \nlimited circumstances where the person is applying for a visa or an Authorization to Return to \nCanada and the person complies with all the requirements set out in R240(2), the removal order \nmust be enforced outside of Canada.  \n \n \n40.1 Procedures to complete the Certificate of Departure \n \n[IMM0056B] \nWhen an officer verifies departure under R240(1), they must issue a Certificate of Departure \n[IMM0056B]to a foreign national when enforcing the removal order. When completing the \nIMM0056B, officers must clearly indicate the type of removal order that was enforced at the time of \ndeparture verification, and have the foreign national sign and write the date beside the appropriate \nremoval order. If the foreign national does not want to sign, the officer should indicate ‘Refused to \nSign’ in the signature space on the IMM0056B. \n \nWhen verifying the departure of a foreign national, the officer should review their identity or travel \ndocuments and ensure that the person departing Canada is the same person named on the removal \norder. Information to assist in confirming identity may vary and can include but not limited to: \nphotos of the individual and identity documents. Accompanying family members issued a removal \norder for being inadmissible under A42(b) do not require a separate Certificate of Departure and \nshould be included on the same Certificate of Departure as the family member who was the\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n88 \n \noriginating cause for the issuance of the removal order. The following fields in the Certificate of \nDeparture (IMM0056B) must be completed by the officer verifying departure: \n \n \nin part A, complete the required background information concerning the foreign national \nincluding details of their travel document; \n \n \nin part B, determine the type of removal order that is being enforced. The type of removal \norder will be straightforward when the person has been issued an exclusion or deportation \norder, see section 9.1(1) for Procedures on Departure Orders. \n \n \nwhen a departure order is verified at a visa office outside Canada, regardless of whether it is \nwithin or beyond the 30-day applicable period, the departure order must be enforced as a \ndeportation order pursuant to R224(2). \n \n \nin part B, record whether the case involves criminality (yes/no). For clarification, the officer \nshould indicate “yes” if there has been any history of criminality recorded in a previous \nA44(1) report; \n \n \nin part B, record the CBSA removal fee pursuant to R243.  \n \n \nin part B, complete all fields and have the person concerned sign and write the date beside \nthe applicable removal order that is being enforced. For departure orders that have become \ndeportation orders, the person must sign the confirmation of a deportation order; \n \n \nin part B, include any additional names of accompanying family members who are the subject \nof a removal order under A42(b). Certificates of departure must not be issued for \naccompanying family members. If a separate IMM0056B is created for an accompanying \nfamily member, the \"PDP\" screen in GCMS will automatically be prompted and should be \ndeleted. Accompanying family members under A42(b) are not considered PDPs and therefore \ndo not require authorization to return to Canada; \n \n \nin part B, complete the originating office field to record the responsibility center code that \ncommenced the removal arrangements for the person. For clarification, removal \narrangements are considered to be arrangements made at the time that the person is \nremoval-ready (the removal order is enforceable and is not subject to any legal \nimpediments). These arrangements will likely have been made from an office in Canada and \nwill include the acquisition of travel documents, the pre-removal interview, the itinerary, the \nbooking of flights, notification of the Canadian visa office abroad and foreign consulate, and \nthe preparation of the removal order information kit; \n \n \nin part C, complete the details of the person’s departure from Canada. These fields include \nthe port of exit/mission, country of destination, carrier, time, date of departure, the CBSA \ninvolved, and the signature of the officer who confirmed the departure. Officers verifying \ndeparture outside Canada must accurately record their office code in the port of exit/mission \nbox. This information is important for statistical and tracking purposes; \n \n \nif an officer acting as an escort from an inland CBSA office has verified the departure of a \nperson with a removal order, enter the CBSA’s responsibility code in the \"CBSA Involved\" \nsection of the IMM0056B. Where an inland CBSA has not commenced any of the removal \narrangements for the person but has assisted in the transport of a person to the airport or \nthe border, or provided officers to the transit point or to the country of destination, the \nresponsibility center code for the inland CBSA office involved is recorded in this field. Officers \nat visa offices outside Canada should complete the “CBSA Involved” box for the office in\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n89 \n \nCanada that is the active holder of the removal file; \n \n \nthe mandatory fields \"Danger to the public\" and \"Unlikely to Appear\" are consistent with the \ngrounds for arrest under A55(2)(a) and must be completed in accordance with the guidance \nprovided in ENF 20. These fields play a key role in identifying which deportee records should \nbe downloaded to the CPIC-PDP database. See section 46 below for an overview of the joint \nIRCC/RCMP initiative concerning previously deported persons. \n \nNote: CBSA offices/responsibility codes are to be placed in fields on the IMM0056B where \napplicable. \n \n \nWhen verifying the departure at the POE, the IMM0056B should be given to the foreign national \nonly after the foreign national signs the Certificate of Departure just prior to boarding the aircraft. \nThe officer should witness the departure of the aircraft from the airport departure gate in order to \nconfirm that the foreign national has actually departed from Canada. GCMS/NCMS should be \nupdated immediately. If the foreign national refuses to sign, the officer should note ‘Refused to \nSign’ in the signature space. \n \nMany important decisions concerning removal functions will be made on the basis of the data \nretrieved from the \"Certificate of Departure\" screen in GCMS/NCMS. Immediately following \ndeparture verification, officers should complete the \"Certificate of Departure\" screen in GCMS/NCMS \nand ensure that they take the following steps: \n \n \ninput information into all mandatory fields of the IMM0056B in GCMS; \n \n \nindicate the type of removal order at the time of departure verification; \n \ninput any additional information into the \"Notes\" screen in GCMS (i.e., airline, flight number, \naction on bond, counselling, comments, etc.); \n \n \nin the case of an overseas escorted removal, enter the details of the departure verification \ninto GCMS/NCMS within 48 hours of the removal officer’s return to Canada; and \n \n \ndistribute the copies of the Certificate of Departure accordingly, and as follows: \no \ncopy 1 to the person concerned; \no \ncopy 2 to the CBSA office that enforced the removal order (file holder);  \n \nFollowing the completion of the \"Certificate of Departure\" screen in GCMS, the \"Previously Deported \nPersons (PDP)\" screen will be prompted and must be completed accordingly. The purpose of this \nscreen is to flag in GCMS and CPIC that the person has been deported from Canada and requires \nauthorization to return to Canada pursuant to A52(1). The \"PDP\" screen will appear (except in \nA42(b) cases) if the type of removal order was either: \n \n \na deportation order; or \n \na departure order which becomes a deportation order. \n \n \n40.2  Verifying departure to the U.S. from airports with  \n         pre-clearance facilities \nIf a foreign national is departing Canada for the United States from an airport with pre-clearance \nfacilities, it is preferable that an officer issue an IMM0056B, after U.S. officials have pre- screened\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n90 \n \nand accepted the foreign national. This process may not always be possible because of the physical \nlayout of some POEs, but the Agency strongly recommends this approach where facilities permit. \nA Certificate of Departure [IMM0056B] should be given to the foreign national only after the foreign \nnational signs the Certificate of Departure just prior to boarding the aircraft. The officer should \nwitness the departure of the aircraft from the airport departure gate to confirm that the foreign \nnational has actually departed from Canada. GCMS/NCMS should be updated immediately. \n \n \n40.3 Verifying departure at land borders \nOfficers at a land border POE should issue a Certificate of Departure at the POE where the foreign \nnational physically departs Canada for the United States. \n \n \nIn the case of foreign nationals who are either U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens, an \nIMM0056B can be completed and signed by an officer at a port of entry; or \n \n \nIn the case of foreign nationals without U.S. status, an officer should obtain the address of \nthe destination and/or a fax number where the IMM0056B can be sent. Mailing or faxing the \nIMM0056B will act as a safeguard to ensure the foreign national receives the Certificate of \nDeparture after being lawfully admitted into the U.S. \n \nOfficers should counsel the foreign national to proceed to the U.S. port of entry to seek entry. \nWhen the officer is turning the foreign national over to the USDHS, the officer should give the \nEnvelope: Removal Documents [BSF582] and contents to the immigration officer at the U.S. POE. \n \n40.4 Verifying departure in the case of a removal order not in \nforce \nIn some instances, officers may encounter a foreign national who has been issued a removal order \nand who requests to voluntarily depart Canada before the removal order comes into force under \nA49(1) or A49(2). Examples of these cases could include the following: \n \n \na permanent resident or a foreign national is issued a removal order with a right of appeal \nand requests to depart Canada before their appeal period expires [A49(1)(b)]; \n \n \na permanent resident or a foreign national is issued a removal order; they have made an \nappeal and request to depart Canada before the final determination of the appeal is made \n[A49(1)(c)]; \n \n \na refugee protection claimant whose claim has been determined ineligible and requests to \ndepart Canada before the expiry of the seven-day period [A49(2)(b)]; \n \n \na refugee protection claimant whose claim is rejected by the Refugee Protection Division \n(RPD) and requests to depart Canada before the expiry of the 15-day period [A49(2)(c)]; \n \n \na refugee protection claimant whose claim is declared withdrawn or abandoned by the RPD \nand who requests to depart Canada before the expiry of the 15-day period [A49(2)(d)]; and \n \n \na refugee protection claimant whose claim is terminated because of misrepresentation or \nmultiple claims and who requests to depart Canada before the expiry of the 15-day period \n[A49(2)(e)].\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n91 \n \n \nNote: The CBSA does not provide notification of a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) to \npersons who wish to leave voluntarily and whose removal order is not in force.  \n \n40.5 Inland procedures – removal order not in force \nWhen a person appears at an inland CBSA office requesting to voluntarily depart from Canada \nbefore the removal order comes into force, as in the case of a refugee claimant who has withdrawn \ntheir claim to the RPD or RAD, the CBSA officer must ensure that the person concerned is aware of \nthe fact that the removal order is not yet in force and of the legal implications. The officer should \nobtain a statutory declaration indicating that the person was advised of these details. \n• The officer should obtain an address for service of the IMM 0056B, which will be sent to the \nperson concerned after the expiration of the seven-day or fifteen-day period under A49. If a \nstatutory declaration is obtained, the address for service should be noted in the declaration. \n• The officer should ensure that a detailed note is entered in GCMS explaining the case \ncircumstances. The GCMS notes should reflect that the person wanted to depart Canada voluntarily, \ntheir reasons for departing, whether a statutory declaration was obtained, whether the statutory \ndeclaration was translated, and where and when the IMM0056B should be sent. \n• The officer should complete a Certificate of Departure package and send it to the POE where the \nperson will depart from. The officer should then follow up with the case and mail the IMM0056B to \nthe address provided by the person after the removal order has come into force under A49(1) or \nA49(2). \n \nWhen a person appears at a CBSA inland office requesting to voluntarily depart from Canada before \nthe removal order comes into force, the officer should advise the person that their removal order \nhas not yet come into force and that they should appear before an officer at a POE. On the arrival of \nthe person at the POE, the POE officer should proceed according to the departure guidelines set out \nin section 39.6 and obtain the required information on the person's departure from Canada. In \ncases where the passport is on file at the inland office, arrangements will need to be made between \nPOE and inland office to transfer the document prior to removal. \n \n40.6 Port of entry procedures – removal order not in force \nIf persons subject to a removal order that is \"not in force\" have presented themselves to an officer \nat a POE and indicated a desire to leave Canada, the POE officer can allow them to depart from \nCanada. A Certificate of Departure should be initiated but not completed until the removal order has \ncome into force under A49(1) or A49(2). IRPA only allows an officer to “enforce” a removal order \nthat has come into force and is enforceable (there is no stay of removal). When faced with this \nscenario, the POE officer should follow the procedures set out below before the persons depart the \nPOE: \n \nThe officer must ensure that the person concerned is aware of the fact that the removal order \nis not yet in force and of the legal implications. The officer should obtain a statutory \ndeclaration indicating that the person was advised of these details. \n \nThe officer should obtain an address for service of the IMM0056B, which will be sent to the \nperson concerned after the expiration of the seven-day or fifteen-day period under A49. If a \nstatutory declaration is obtained, the address for service should be noted in the declaration.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n92 \n \n \nThe officer should ensure that a detailed note is entered in GCMS explaining the case \ncircumstances. The GCMS notes should reflect that the person wanted to depart Canada \nvoluntarily, their reasons for departing, whether a statutory declaration was obtained, \nwhether the statutory declaration was translated, and where and when the IMM0056B should \nbe sent. \n \nThe officer should follow up the case and mail the IMM0056B to the address provided by the \nperson after the removal order has come into force under A49(1) or A49(2). \n \n40.7 Completion of the Certificate of Departure – removal  \n        order not in force \nThe procedures to complete a Certificate of Departure (IMM0056B) for removal orders not in force \nare different from the regular procedures for confirming departure. Officers are reminded that they \ncannot enforce the removal order until it comes into force and is enforceable. The enforcement of \nthe removal order occurs only after the Certificate of Departure has been signed by an officer on \nthe date of confirmation. When verifying departure of persons with removal orders not in force, POE \nofficers must take the following steps at the time of the person's departure: \n \n \ncomplete boxes in parts A and B as provided for in section 39.1; \n \nhave the person sign beside the applicable removal order that is to be enforced. For example, \nif a refugee claimant was issued a departure order and has subsequently withdrawn their \nrefugee claim, the applicable removal order will be a departure order; \n \nleave the \"Date of Confirmation\" field blank; \n \nensure that any accompanying family members under A42(b) are recorded; and \ncomplete the following fields in part C: port of exit; final destination; carrier; time and date of \ndeparture; and CBSA involved. \n \nOfficers should calculate and note the date the removal order will come into force and bring forward \nthe IMM 0056B for final completion. At the time the removal order becomes in force, officers must \ncomplete the following fields in the IMM0056B to enforce the removal order: \n \n \nrecord the date of confirmation in part B. This date will be determined by calculating the \nperiod from which the removal order will come into force under A49(2). \nExample: If a refugee claimant withdraws their claim on March 1, 2014, the removal order will \ncome into force 15 days later [A49(2)(d)]. In this case, the date of confirmation will be March \n16, 2014. For further information on establishing the date when a removal order comes into \nforce, refer to, section 9.3. \n \nsign in the box designated for “Signature of Officer” in part C; and \n \nensure the form is accurately completed. \n \nAfter the IMM0056B is completed, it should be entered into GCMS/NCMS and mailed to the address \nprovided by the foreign national. If the case was referred from an inland office, the POE officer \nshould forward a copy of the IMM0056B to the appropriate inland office for its file.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n93 \n \n41 When a removal order is enforced by an officer \noutside of Canada (Canadian Mission) – R240(2)   \nOfficers outside Canada may encounter foreign nationals who are subjects of unenforced removal \norders and who are applying to return to Canada. Pursuant to R25, an officer shall not issue a visa \nto a foreign national who is the subject of an unenforced removal order. \nIn limited circumstances, R240(2) authorizes officers outside Canada to enforce an unenforced \nremoval order. To enforce a removal order outside Canada, officers must have the designated \nauthority under the Designation of Officers and Delegations of Authority by the Minister of Public \nSafety and Emergency Preparedness under the IRPA and IRPR, item 224 of the Designated Officials \nof the International Network.  \nOfficers should keep in mind that the CBSA's overriding priority is to maintain control of the removal \nprocess. The CBSA aims to ensure that persons who are subject to removal orders verify their \ndeparture at a POE when they depart from Canada. The enforcement of removal orders outside \nCanada is not to be encouraged, but applied in limited circumstances where a foreign national is \napplying for a visa or authorization to return to Canada [IMM1203B] and satisfies a designated \nofficer that all of the criteria under R240(2) have been met. \n \n41.1  Criteria for the enforcement of a removal order  \n         outside Canada \nIn order for an officer to enforce an unenforced removal order of a foreign national outside Canada, \nR240(2) establishes that the foreign national must make an application to an officer for one of the \nfollowing documents: \n \na permanent resident visa; \n \na temporary resident visa; or \n \nan authorization to return to Canada under A52(1). \nBefore a visa or an authorization to return to Canada can be issued, the officer conducting the \nexamination must first determine whether the person has been previously issued a removal order \nand whether the removal order has been enforced. If the foreign national is the subject of an \nunenforced removal order, the officer shall enforce the removal order under R240(2) if they \nestablish that the foreign national is the person described in the order.  \nThe onus is on the foreign national, who is making the application to return to Canada to prove that \nthey are the person described in the order, and not with the officer conducting the examination. If \nthe foreign national cannot satisfy the officer who is assessing the application, the removal order \nmust remain unenforced and any application must be refused.  \n \n41.2  Positive decision to enforce a removal order outside  \n         Canada \nAfter the foreign national has satisfied an officer that they have met the requirements for verifying \ndeparture outside Canada as outlined in section 40.1, the officer conducting the examination or a \ndesignated officer in the same office must enforce the removal order and issue a Certificate of \nDeparture.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n94 \n \nThe Certificate of Departure, [IMM0056B], is a serialized, multi-copy document that serves as proof \nthat a removal order has been enforced. This form is available in hard copy at visa offices outside \nCanada. For detailed instructions on completing the Certificate of Departure, see section 39.1. \nCopy 2 of the IMM0056B should be accompanied by a memo instructing the in-Canada CBSA officer \nto input the IMM0056B information into GCMS/NCMS. Upon receipt, the CBSA officer must input the \nIMM0056B and other case details into GCMS/NCMS to ensure that the systems reflect the fact that \nthe removal order has been enforced. \nIt is important to note that pursuant to R224(2), all departure orders that are not enforced at a POE \nupon departure of the foreign national from Canada must be enforced as deportation orders, even if \nthe 30-day period for enforcement at a POE has not yet passed.  \nIf the removal order is a deportation order, exclusion order (within the excluded period), or a \ndeparture order that has become a deportation order through operation of law, the applicant should \nalways obtain the Authorization to Return to Canada under A52(1) prior to the visa issuance. This is to \navoid the contradictory situation of a person appearing at a POE with a visa but without an \nAuthorization to Return to Canada issued by an officer pursuant to A52(1). \nAfter an Authorization to Return to Canada is granted, officers outside Canada must ensure that any \noutstanding warrants are cancelled by contacting the CBSA office that issued the warrant. \n \n41.3  Negative decision to enforce a removal order outside \n         Canada \nIf a foreign national who has made an application does not satisfy the examining officer outside \nCanada that they are the person described in the order under R240(2),the foreign national’s removal \norder will remain unenforced. In such circumstances, any application for a visa must be refused [R25]. \nA foreign national who is the subject of an unenforced removal order is not entitled to obtain a visa or \nan Authorization to Return to Canada. \nThe officer should advise such persons that they are ineligible for a visa due to the outstanding \nunenforced removal order against them, and that if they attempt to re-enter Canada, they will be \nsubject to enforcement action. \n \n \n42  \nWhen a removal order is administratively enforced \n \n \nby an officer in Canada – R240(3)  \nA foreign national who leaves Canada and does not comply with the departure requirements of \nR240(1) cannot be said to have enforced their removal order. In these cases, the order remains \nunenforced. \nIn the case of a departure order where a foreign national does not meet the requirements under \nR240(1)(a), R240(1)(b) and R240(1)(c) within the prescribed period of time, the order becomes a \ndeportation order by operation of law under [R224(2)]. As such, departure orders enforced under \nR240(3) must always be deemed deportation orders.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n95 \n \n42.1  Verifying departure by an officer in Canada  \nAn into force removal order against a foreign national may be enforced under R240(3) by an officer in \nCanada when the officer confirms, on a balance of probabilities, that the foreign national has departed \nfrom Canada, and has not returned. R240(3) does not apply for situations where the removal \norder is stayed. For additional information on stays of removal orders, please refer to Procedures 10-\n12.  \nThe following list of non-exhaustive information may support an officer’s determination that the \nindividual has departed Canada: \n1. Information from partners and stakeholders \n2. Information directly submitted by the foreign national \n3. Open source Information \n \nTo determine that the foreign national has not returned to Canada, the officer must conduct \nverifications in the systems, including GCMS, NCMS and CPIC. \nAs the foreign national is outside Canada, they will not have the opportunity to sign the Certificate of \nDeparture or be provided with a copy of the form. Officers must complete the IMM 0056B with \ninformation that they have at their disposal. The items under Section C – Verification of Departure \nmust be entered as “Unknown”. Officers must sign and date the form on the date the officer \ncompleted their determination, based on the evidence and on a balance of probabilities, that the \nforeign national has departed from Canada. Note that there will be no duty to inform the foreign \nnational that their removal order has been enforced. The copy of the IMM 0056B should remain on file \nand uploaded into GCMS. Additional direction is available in Operational Bulletin: PRG-2018-65. \n \n \n43 Procedure: Persons refused entry to their country of \ndestination after a Certificate of Departure has been issued \nWhen a foreign national has been issued a Certificate of Departure [IMM0056B] and is subsequently \nrefused admission to another country, they remain the subject of an unenforced removal order (see \ndefinition of \"Unenforced removal order\" in section 6 above). When refusal occurs and the person \nappears back at the port of entry, officers should take the following steps: \na) examine the person [A18(1)]; \nb) cancel the \"PDP\" screen in GCMS (make sure appropriate Notes are added); \nc) delete the IMM0056B if it has not been microfilmed or, if it has received a microfilm number, \nsend an e-mail to GCMS Data Quality Control at National Headquarters with instructions to \ndelete the IMM0056B from GCMS. \nd) Add note to GCMS that the removal order has not been enforced. Also include any \ncircumstances surrounding the person’s refusal into another country and include instructions \nto the Warrant Response Centre (WRC) to delete the PDP information from CPIC; \nNote: The WRC will receive daily reports on the cancellation of \"PDP\" screens. Based on instructions in \nGCMS notes, the WRC will delete the PDP information from CPIC. \ne) in the case of a departure order, advise the person of the time remaining before the \ndeparture order becomes a deportation order. The departure order remains enforceable and\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n96 \n \ncan be enforced like any other removal order. Under R224(2), if a departure order is not \nenforced within 30 days, the foreign national has not complied with the departure \nrequirements under R240(1) and the departure order becomes a deportation order; \nf) \nadvise the foreign national that after being refused entry to yet another country, they will be \nallowed back into Canada, but the removal order against them remains unenforced. (for the \noptions available to officers after a foreign national has been refused entry to another \ncountry, refer to section 42.1 below); and \ng) later, when the person departs Canada, the officer should complete and issue a new \nCertificate of Departure. \n \n \n43.1 Options available after being refused entry to another   \n        country \nWhen a foreign national has been previously issued a Certificate of Departure and has been refused \nentry to another country, the officer at the POE must conduct an interview to determine the method of \nenforcing the removal order. Although this assessment was previously conducted before the foreign \nnational departed Canada, they are subject to a new determination of how their removal order should \nbe enforced since the circumstances surrounding their removal may have changed. In addition, \nofficers should keep in mind that the removal order is unenforced and the foreign national must \ncomply with the criteria for a removal order to become enforced. The following options are available to \nofficers after a person has been refused entry to another country and is being examined under the \nauthority of A18(1). \n \n1. Allow the person to proceed into Canada \nOfficers should interview the person to determine the person's ability and intent to depart Canada, \nand, in the case of a departure order, the likelihood of the person's leaving Canada within the 30-day \napplicable period (if any). When an officer believes that the person will continue to make every effort \nto leave Canada as soon as possible or within the time remaining in their 30-day applicable period, \nthey should allow the person to enter Canada under R27(3). Before the foreign national is allowed to \nproceed into Canada, the officer should take the following steps: \n \nobtain information that would be useful to investigators, such as the person's Canadian \naddress and the addresses of relatives and friends in Canada; \n \nremind the foreign national of the importance of leaving Canada and that they remain the \nsubject of an enforceable removal order (if there are no stays of removal); \n \ncounsel the person that, under A55, they may be arrested for removal if they fail to depart \nCanada, in the case of a departure order, after the 30-day applicable period or, in all other \ncases, as soon as possible; \n \ncounsel the person that they will have to appear before an officer at a POE to verify their \ndeparture from Canada; and \n \namend GCMS/NCMS to reflect the action taken, specifically that the person has returned to \nCanada, and provide other information concerning the person's travel plans.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n97 \n \n2.  Impose conditions and/or the payment of a deposit or the posting \nof a guarantee for compliance \nUnder A44(3), an officer may impose any conditions, including the payment of a deposit or the posting \nof a guarantee for compliance with the conditions, on persons subject to a removal order. The purpose \nof the conditions and/or the deposit or guarantee for compliance is to encourage compliance with IRPA \nafter the officer is satisfied that the person will leave Canada. Refer to ENF 8, for further information \non taking a deposit, and to ENF 8, for taking a guarantee for compliance. After an officer issues a \ndeposit or guarantee for compliance, the officer should follow the procedures outlined in Option 1 \nabove. It is important that all deposit or guarantee information, including any conditions imposed, are \ninput into GCMS/NCMS. \n \n3. Arrest and detention for removal \nWhere an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the foreign national who is the subject of a \nremoval order is a danger to the public or is unlikely to depart Canada and present themselves before \nan officer to verify their departure from Canada, the officer may arrest and detain the person for \nremoval [A55(2)]. After a foreign national has been arrested and detained, this information should be \ninput into GCMS/NCMS. For procedures on making an arrest, see  ENF 7. \n \n \n44 Procedure: Removal to the United States \nThe following subsections contain detailed information about removals to the United States following \nthe termination of the Reciprocal Arrangement on October 30, 2009. \n \n44.1 Persons who can be removed to the U.S. \nThe following classes of foreign nationals may be returned to the U.S: \n \na foreign national who is a citizen of the U.S.  \n \na foreign national who is a national of the U.S.  \nA national of the U.S. is a person who is not a citizen of that country, but who owes permanent \nallegiance to it. Similar to Canadian Immigration laws, U.S. Citizens have the legal right to return to \ntheir country whereas permanent residents have the right of abode that only a U.S. Immigration Judge \nwill determine if it is in question. The receiving U.S. POE will accept verbal notice of the deportee's \nreturn to the U.S. if they are properly documented. \n \n44.2  Documents required when removing to the U.S. \nU.S. officials require that all individuals entering their country be properly documented. \nIn line with the documentary requirements under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), \nwhich are the primary recognized documents to assert an individual U.S. citizenship, other satisfactory \nconfirmation of U.S. status can be presented. \nDuring the course of their investigation, officers will continue to perform database checks and gather \nall the necessary evidence providing status to the individual in the U.S and be prepared to provide \nidentity documents; such as passports, emergency travel documents, birth certificates, certificate of \nnaturalization etc. The documentation will support and provide evidence to U.S. officials during the \nremoval.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n98 \n \n44.3 Advance notice of deportees of interest to U.S. law  \n     enforcement authorities \nIf, well before the actual removal, officers are aware that a deportee is or may be of interest to law \nenforcement authorities in the U.S., officers should provide the appropriate law enforcement agency \nwith advance notice of the relevant facts and circumstances of the case and the person's travel \narrangements. \n \n44.4 Persons issued a direction to leave or a direction to return  \n       to the U.S. after applying for entry at a Canadian POE \nIn these cases, the foreign national will have: \n \na copy of the Direction to Leave Canada [BSF503] because an officer is unable to examine \nthe person under R40(1); or \n \na copy of the Direction to Return to the U.S. [BSF505] under R41 because an officer is not \navailable to complete an examination, the PS Minister is not available to review an A44(2) \nreport, or an admissibility hearing cannot be held. \n \n \n \n45 Procedure: Removal to the United States for variable \n       cases \n \nThis section contains detailed information about removal to the United States for variable cases. \n \n \n45.1  Notice to the U.S. in cases involving medical care or  \n         treatment \nThe officer must provide advance written notice of the return of any removal case to the U.S. if the \nofficer has evidence to suggest that medical attention is required because of a mental or physical \ncondition. The written notice of the return of the person being removed must include: \n \na written opinion of a competent authority (such as a medical doctor or an official of \na medical institution) confirming the need for care or treatment; \n \na description of the facts and circumstances of the case; and \n \nthe deportee's travel arrangements. The officer must supply this information as soon \nas possible if they are not able to do so when giving notice. \n \n \n45.2  Official records and privacy consideration \nUnder the Privacy Act the officer may provide information from the CBSA’s files to U.S. authorities: \n \nto establish that a deportee is returnable; \n \nto ensure that appropriate arrangements for reception are made for deportees requiring \nmedical care;\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n99 \n \n \nto find out whether the deportee is wanted by U.S. law-enforcement authorities; and to \nassist port-of-entry procedures if safety and security factors may be indicated. \n \nThe USDHS may provide information from its files to Canadian government offices for these purposes. \nIn cases involving criminality (such as deportees wanted by Canadian police authorities), U.S. \nauthorities will communicate directly with the RCMP. \nOfficers may furnish U.S. authorities with fingerprints and photographs obtained under A16 only when \nidentity is in doubt. \n \n \n45.3  Notification of persons being removed for criminal or \ndrug offences \nOfficers notify the missions abroad of persons being removed from Canada to any country for criminal \nor drug convictions. In U.S. cases, officers should also notify the U.S. immigration attaché in Ottawa \nand the receiving USDHS authorities. \nOfficers should ensure that the U.S. immigration attaché is notified of all persons being removed to the \nU.S. for all criminal or drug offences, and the reason they have been found to be in contravention of \nA34, A35, A36(1), A36(2) and A37. \n \n45.4  Request for confirmation of vital statistics in the U.S. \nAn officer must make all requests in the most expedient manner, such as priority post, facsimile, e-\nmail and so forth. \n \nFor New York City, the request must be in the following form: \nI have been authorized by (name) to obtain confirmation of the birth of (name) on (date) at New York \nCity in (borough), son of (father's name) and (mother's name). Please confirm birth particulars as \nsoon as possible, by courier, facsimile, telegram or whatever is local office procedure. \n \n \nOfficers should send the request to: \n \nDirector of Vital Records, \n \nNY City Department of Health, 125 Worth Street, Room 133,  \n \n \nNew York City, N.Y. 10031 \nFor foreign nationals under a removal order who were born in Georgia, officers should make the \nrequest, including all relevant information, through the Immigration Section of the Canadian Consulate \nGeneral in New York City. The consulate will inform the officer of the findings of the search made by \nthe Georgia Department of Human Resources. If the officer needs a birth certificate, the same \nprocedure should be followed; the consulate will obtain the document and send it to the officer. The \nconsulate will cover all costs. \n \nSome states have specific requirements for confirmation of birth particulars, and several charge fees.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n100 \n \nFor the following states, officers should make the requests through the responsible Canadian \nconsulate: \n \nConnecticut: requires a written government request and the written consent of the \nindividual concerned; \n \n \nIowa: send requests through the Buffalo office; \n \n \nNebraska: fee, billed to the Buffalo office; \n \n \nNew Hampshire: fee; \n \n \nOklahoma: requires a letter of authority from the foreign national concerned and \nparticulars of the foreign national's parents, including the mother's maiden name; \nfee; \n \n \nTexas: keeps statistics by county and requires the consent of the foreign national \nconcerned for every county except Dallas; fee; \n \n \nWisconsin: fee, billed to the Buffalo office. \n \nIf the officer encounters problems in verifying births in a particular state, they should contact the \nimmigration section of the responsible Canadian consulate, which will then contact the vital statistics \ndepartment with the request, guarantee payment of any fee, and return the information to the officer. \nWhen the officer sends a request through a consulate, the officer must provide the office's financial \ncode so that the consulate can recover any expenses incurred. \nIf a state refuses to release birth information because the foreign national concerned will not consent \nto its release, and all other methods have failed, the officer may have to contact the U.S. immigration \nattaché. \nIf the officer has asked the U.S. immigration attaché or USDHS to confirm or secure vital statistics for \nforeign nationals under a removal order, and the officer has then been able to get the information \nfrom another source, they must inform the attaché or USDHS immediately. \n \n \n45.5  Removal via the U.S. to other countries \nEscorted persons: Officers require the consent of the U.S. Immigration Attaché in Ottawa to remove \na person under escort via the U.S. to a third country. On arrival at the U.S. POE, the escort officer \nmust: \n \nobtain a US 1-94 form from the U.S. examining officer; \n \n \nhave the form signed by the master of the vehicle by which the person's departure from \nthe U.S. is effected; \n \n \nreturn the signed form to the U.S. port of issue; and sign the Certificate of Departure \n[IMM0056B] after the departure has been verified. \n \nUnless the officer makes other arrangements with the USDHS, it is the CBSA’s responsibility to \narrange for an escort for the removal via the U.S. of a foreign national deported after admission to\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n101 \n \nCanada, if the foreign national must disembark in the U.S. en route to a third country. This provision \napplies even if the airline does not require the foreign national under a removal order to be escorted. \nRemoval by air: If officers remove a person from Canada on an aircraft that merely calls for servicing \nat a U.S. airport and then continues to its destination in a third country, officers do not need to \nprovide an escort through the U.S. Officers must give advance notice to the USDHS office where the \naircraft lands regarding the expected date and time of arrival and departure, so that the person does \nnot disembark and the USDHS can verify departure. Depending on local office procedures, officers may \nalso inform the U.S. Immigration Attaché. \nRemoval on ships calling at U.S. ports: An escort is not necessary when officers are removing a \nperson from Canada to a third country on a ship that may call at a U.S. port before proceeding abroad. \nIf officers know the port of call, officers must inform the USDHS officer in charge or the USDHS \nregional director. The ship's master is responsible for safeguarding the person and informing the \nUSDHS officer in charge that the person is on board. \nThe officer is still required to escort the person under a removal order who is brought into either \ncountry in transit for embarkation on a ship. \n \n \nPART VI – File Closure  \n \n46 \nProcedure: File clean-up after removal \nOnce a person has been removed from Canada, there are still additional procedures that must be \ncompleted before the file can be considered complete. The officer responsible for the removal should \nensure that: \na. the IMM0056B is on file and entered into GCMS/NCMS and any local case-tracking \nprocedures are completed; \nb. NCMS is updated and all processes concluded; \nc. the appropriate copy of the removal order has been sent to the Records Services Division, \nMicrofilm Unit at IRCC-NHQ to be microfilmed; and \nd. case notes that are relevant to the removal are added to the file, including a copy of any \nincident report if the officer encountered such actions as physical resistance or threatening \ncomments on an escorted removal. \n \nThe officer should also take the following steps: \n \ne. if necessary, request that the return of a security deposit or guarantee for compliance is \nactioned. For further information on the refund or forfeiture of a security deposit or \nguarantee, refer to ENF 8; \nf. \nfor billing purposes, contact the appropriate officer in transportation liability cases where the \nCBSA has made removal arrangements on behalf of the transportation company. In cases \nwhere the transporter is liable for the removal costs, the officer should ensure that an \nBSF501 form is completed and a copy sent to the Transporter Obligations Program along \nwith associated e-ticket/s and any supporting documents (e.g. Certificate of Departure, \nescort expense statements).  This form outlines all costs incurred in removing a person from \nCanada (with the exception of detention costs). Expenses include flight costs for deportees \nand escorting officers, fees for travel documents, fees for visas, wages of escorting officers\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n102 \n \nincluding any overtime, accommodations, meals and incidentals, public transportation costs, \nentry/exit permits, etc.; \ng. if appropriate, contact the Crown counsel to confirm that a person has been removed from \nCanada; \nh. notify other agencies (i.e., parole, probation, welfare, health, Human Resources and Social \nDevelopment Canada, etc.) to confirm that the person has been removed from Canada; and \ni. \nreturn any seized government-issued documents to the respective agencies (i.e., driver’s \nlicence, social insurance cards, health cards, etc.). For further information on disposing of \nseized documents, refer to ENF 12, section 11. \n \nThere may also be other local procedures in place for larger offices, such as archiving files. Officers \nshould refer to local office policy for concluding removal cases. On occasion, a file can be closed for \nreasons other than the successful removal of a person from Canada. Some possibilities include the \nfollowing. \nj. \nIf a person is deceased, GCMS should be updated accordingly, along with explanatory \nremarks. Officers should update NCMS and complete the notes to file. \nk. If the USDHS advises the CBSA that a person has been apprehended in the U.S. and \ndeported to their country of nationality, CBSA can confirm a person is no longer in Canada. \nAn update to GCMS should be entered along with explanatory remarks. Officers should \nupdate NCMS and complete a memo to file; \nl. \nIf an officer at a Canadian mission outside Canada has enforced a removal order pursuant to \nR240(2) and issued a Certificate of Departure, visa officers have been instructed to send the \nresponsible removal office in Canada a copy of the notes and the IMM0056B. Upon receipt, \nthe officer at the removal office in Canada should input the provided information into \nGCMS/NCMS. \nm. If a decision is made to grant permanent resident status, officers should update NCMS. The \nremoval order becomes void when the person becomes a permanent resident under A51. \nOfficers must be satisfied that the file is no longer considered an active removal case before \nconcluding. If officers have any concern about whether a case should be closed, they should contact \ntheir manager or supervisor for assistance. \n \n \n47 Procedure: Entering previously deported persons into \n \nCPIC \nThe primary objective for entering previously deported persons (PDP) into the Canadian Police \nInformation Centre (CPIC) is to enhance public safety and security by providing peace officers with the \nnecessary information to form reasonable grounds that the person may be arrested without a warrant \nunder A55(2)(a). The CPIC-PDP database will equip peace officers across Canada with information that \na foreign national has been deported from Canada, has returned to Canada without the authorization \nprescribed under A52(1) and, at the time of the person’s removal, there were reasonable grounds to \nbelieve that the person was a danger to the public or was unlikely to appear. \nAfter a name is queried in CPIC and is a direct match with a person found in the PDP database, CPIC \nwill instruct law enforcement partners to contact the WRC for further assistance. For the purposes of \narrests made without a warrant under IRPA, peace officers as defined in section 2 of the Criminal Code \nhave the authority under A55(2)(a) to arrest and detain a foreign national without a warrant. For \nfurther information on arrest and detention by peace officers under IPRA, see ENF 7, section 16.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n103 \n \nInformation on individuals in the CPIC-PDP database originates from the GCMS-PDP database. For \nmore information on who will be added to the GCMS-PDP database, see section 46.1 below; for \ninformation on who will be added to the CPIC-PDP database, see section 46.2 below. \n \n47.1  Who will be added to the previously deported persons  \n         database in GCMS? \nPersons issued a Certificate of Departure [IMM0056B] and removed from Canada under a deportation \norder or a departure order that has become a deportation order will be added to the GCMS-PDP \ndatabase, except where the removal order was issued to a person described in A42(b) as an \naccompanying family member and is therefore exempted from the need for authorization to return to \nCanada as required under A52(1). \nIn such cases, the deportee will be added to the GCMS-PDP database and a previous deportee \n(PREV.DEP) flag will be enabled in GCMS. \nNote: Persons removed pursuant to exclusion orders and departure orders will not be added to the \nGCMS-PDP database at this time. \n \n \n       47.2  Who will be added to the previously deported persons  \n                database in CPIC? \nThere will be an automatic transfer to the CPIC system of PDP information on \nindividuals who meet the criteria in section 46.1 above and for whom, at the time of \ndeparture, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is either: \n \na danger to the public; or \n \nunlikely to appear for examination, an admissibility hearing, removal from \nCanada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order \nby the Minister under A44(2). \n \n \n \n48 Procedure: Repayment of removal expenses \nAs per section 243 of the IRPR, all foreign nationals removed from Canada (under deemed \ndeportation, deportation, departure or exclusion order) at the CBSA’s expense are required to repay \nthe costs of their removal in order to return to Canada, provided the costs are not recovered from a \ntransporter. \nIn the absence of transporter liability, foreign nationals must repay: \n \n$3,840 for removal without escort or under escort other than by air; and [R243(a)];  \nand \n \n$12,880 for removal under escort by air [R243(b)]. \n \nForeign nationals must be counseled on the requirement to seek repayment of removal costs should \nthe CBSA pay for their removal from Canada. Many foreign nationals opt to purchase their own airline \nticket for removal purposes in order to avoid this fee.\n2025-02-03 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n104 \n \nIn most cases, foreign nationals who are required to repay removal costs will pay the fee as part of an \napplication for an Authorization to Return to Canada or application for a temporary resident visa at a \nvisa office overseas before travelling to Canada. Additional information on the ARC can be obtained at \nIRCC - Authorization to return to Canada (ARC) (ci.gc.ca). \nHowever, there may be situations where foreign nationals are required to pay the fee at a port of \nentry. For example, foreign nationals who are visa-exempt may arrive at a port of entry and seek \nentry to Canada without having paid the required fee as part of an application overseas. In these \ncases, it will be the BSO’s responsibility to properly assess and collect the fee, as required. Additional \ninformation for BSO’s at the POE can be found in OB PRG-2014-49.  \n \n \n49 Procedure: Victims Bill of Rights \nAs part of statutory obligations under the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights, subparagraph 26(1)(b)(v) of \nthe Correctional and Conditional Release Act requires that Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) \nnotify registered victims of the offender’s removal from Canada, if removal occurs before the \nexpiration of the sentence. Because of this, the CBSA must provide CSC with the removal date through \nthe Offender Management System (OMS). \nAs part of departure verification activities following the removal of a federal offender (relevant dates \ncan be found in OMS and/or on file), the officer shall input the date of removal in the immigration \nscreen of the OMS if the offender’s sentence has not expired. This should be done as soon as possible \nfollowing removal in order that CSC can meet its statutory obligations to provide victims with relevant \nand timely information concerning the removal, and should be part of regular post-removal file clean-\nup activities. \n \n \n50 Procedure: Electronic Travel Authorization Cancellation \nThe Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) is an entry requirement that allows Canada to pre- screen \nvisa-exempt travellers, apart from U.S. citizens and certain other exempt travellers, in order to flag \nforeign nationals with any known inadmissibility concerns before they travel to Canada by air. \nAn eTA will be valid for up to five years or until the passport expires, whichever comes first. However, \nan eTA can be cancelled in cases where an officer determines that a foreign national is inadmissible. \nPursuant to section 12.06 of Immigration, Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), an officer may \ncancel an electronic travel authorization that was issued to a foreign national if: \n(a) the officer determines that the foreign national is inadmissible; or \n(b) the foreign national is the subject of a declaration made under subsection 22.1(1) of the Act. \nAs per the IRCC Instrument of Designation and Delegation, inland enforcement officers are delegated \nto cancel an eTA. If an individual is removed but still has a valid eTA, the officer must first review the \nfile and determine that the person is inadmissible to Canada, make notes documenting that decision, \nand then cancel the eTA when closing the file. Once the removal has been enforced, the officer will \ninactivate the eTA in GCMS and issue correspondence that will notify the foreign national by email of \nthe reason the eTA was cancelled and further options they may pursue (may seek a Judicial Review of \nthe decision at the Federal Court level). The \"How to Inactivate an eTA, Issue eTA Cancelled Letter\" \nguide provides instructions on how to inactivate the eTA and notify the traveller of the cancellation."
