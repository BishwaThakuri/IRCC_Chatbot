by date  \n2016-02-23  \nThe content in sections 10 and 11.8 has been moved as part of the Department’s efforts to \nmodernize operational guidance to staff. It can now be found in the program delivery instructions \non permanent residence applications for Quebec economic classes.  \n2008-08-07  \nSection 8.7, What is a qualifying business?, has been amended to provide instructions on how to \nassess entrepreneur or investor applicants’ “business experience.” Officers are now required to \nconsider the aggregate financial information of more than one business.  \nSection 8.9, Calculating percentage of equity for Entrepreneur applicants, has been added.  \nSection 10.2 has been updated to reflect that entrepreneurs selected by Quebec on or after \nOctober 16, 2006 are subject to conditions specified by the province of Quebec.  \n2004-09-15 \nSection 6.15, Self Employed (R88), “relevant experience” and section 11.2 are amended to \nevaluate experience in cultural activities and athletics individually and in respect of both self-\nemployment and participation at a world class level. \nSection 8.8, What is the time factor?, has been amended to provide instructions on how to \ndetermine the time period in which one-year periods of business operations can be considered \nfor the purpose of business experience calculation. \nSection 8.20, What should be included in a personal net worth statement?, has been amended to \nremove the requirement that an entrepreneur’s net worth be liquid. Entrepreneurs are now \nrequired to demonstrate a legally obtained net worth – but are not required to prove their \nintention and ability to conduct business in Canada beyond stating that they intend and will be \nable to meet their conditions. \n2003-06-04  \nBoth minor and substantive changes and clarifications have been made throughout this chapter. \n \nSection 11.3 \nIn particular, section 11.3 better defines what intent and ability are in relation to applicants \napplying as farmers in the self-employed class. It describes the capital intensive nature of \nfarming. It also describes the demanding skills and experience required to manage a farm. It will \nassist visa offices in making decisions on persons applying in this class.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n5 \n1 What this chapter is about  \nThis chapter outlines the broad objectives of the Business Immigration Program. It focuses \nspecifically on procedures used at visa offices abroad to process entrepreneurs and self-\nemployed persons.  \nThe chapter reviews:  \n \nthe regulatory definitions;  \n \nselection criteria; and  \n \noperational issues. \nNote: Procedures related to skilled workers are contained in chapter OP 6. Procedures related to \ninvestors are discussed in chapter OP 9.  \n2 Program objectives  \nThe Business Immigration Program includes three classes of applicants:  \n \nentrepreneurs; \n \ninvestors;  \n \nself-employed persons. \nThe principles of the Business Immigration Program are in keeping with the overall objectives of \nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (A3) and specifically those in A3(1)(a) and (c).  \nThe program's objectives are:  \n \nto promote economic development and employment by attracting people with venture \ncapital, business acumen and entrepreneurial skills; \n \nto develop new commercial opportunities and to improve access to growing foreign \nmarkets by \"importing\" people who are familiar with those markets and their special \nrequirements and customs; \n \nto support provincial and territorial economic objectives.  \n3 The Act and Regulations  \n3.1 General sections of the Act that apply to entrepreneurs or self-\nemployed persons \nProvision  \nAct and Regulations  \nEntering and remaining in Canada  \nA18, A19, A20  \nEconomic immigration  \nA12(2)  \nApplications for visas  \nA11(1) and A11(2)  \nProvisions respecting conditions  \nA14(2)(d)  \nAuthority of a province to impose conditions  \nA9(1)(d)  \nAuthority for interviews by designated officer  \nA11(1), A15, A16\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n6 \nAuthority to prescribe conditions  \nA14(2)(d)  \n3.2 Specific Regulations that apply to entrepreneurs or self-employed \npersons \nProvision  \nAct and Regulations  \nDefinition of:  \n   \n\"Entrepreneur\" and \"self-employed person\"  \nR88  \n“Business Experience”  \nR88  \n“Full-time job equivalent”  \nR88  \n“Net assets”, “net income” and “net worth”  \nR88  \n“Percentage of equity”  \nR88  \n“Qualifying business”  \nR88  \nApplication to cancel conditions  \nR98(4)  \nSelection criteria, entrepreneur  \nR102(1), R102(2), R108  \nUnits of assessment, entrepreneur  \nR102(2), R78, R79, R81, R103(1), \nR104  \nSelection criteria—experience factor (entrepreneurs)  R103(1)  \nSelection criteria, self-employed person  \nR102(1) and R102(2)  \nUnits of assessment, self-employed person  \nR78, R79, R81, R103(2), R105  \nPersons selected by a Province  \nR99(b), R96(b), R101(b)  \nPersons destined for the Province of Quebec  \nR108(1)(c)  \nSubstitution of evaluation  \nR109(1) and R109(2)  \nPrescription of conditions subject to which members \nof the entrepreneur class and their family members \nshall be granted permanent resident status  \nR98(1) to R98(6)  \nMinimum points to pass—Investors  \nR108(2)  \nMinimum points to pass—Entrepreneurs  \nR108(3)  \nMinimum points to pass—Self-employed persons  \nR108(4)  \n3.3 Forms required \nForm Title  \nForm Number  \nThe Guide for Business Applicants and Application \nForm  \nIMM 4000E  \nApplication for Permanent Residence in Canada  \nIMM 0008EGEN  \nConfirmation of Permanent Residence  \nIMM 5509B\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n7 \n4 Instruments and Delegations  \nFor delegations on the Business Immigration Program, see IL 3, module 2.  \n5 Departmental policy  \n5.1 Promoting business immigration  \nSubject to operational priorities, officers may be able to provide objective information about the \nentrepreneur program to applicants and third-party representatives. Again, subject to \noperational pressures, officers, on occasion, will be able to take an active promotion and \nmarketing role.  \nPromotional efforts should familiarize potential applicants with the services offered by provincial \ngovernments to business immigrants. Where feasible, officers should coordinate their \npromotional efforts with provincial government representatives.  \nOfficers may encourage individuals to apply as entrepreneurs in a variety of ways. For more \ninformation, see:  \n \nHolding business immigration seminars, section 5.2 \n \nSupplying promotional material, section 5.3 \n5.2 Holding business immigration seminars  \nWhere potential demand warrants and resources are available, business immigration seminars \nmay be held to:  \n \nprovide information about the program; \n \nfield questions from those in attendance; and \n \nclarify the roles and responsibilities of the federal and provincial governments. \n5.3 Supplying promotional material  \nOne example is the guide \"Applying as a Business Immigrant\" which is available on the CIC \nInternet site at http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/guides/4000ESap.pdf (Simplified \nApplication Process) or http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/guides/4000ESap.pdf (Regular \nApplication Process). The guide explains the entrepreneur, investor and self-employed classes \nand application procedures. It is a standard source of written counselling information on the \nBusiness Immigration Program from the federal government. \n5.4 Obtaining relevant information (A11)  \nThe onus is on the applicant to produce all relevant information in support of their application.  \n \nThe applicant is expected to provide original supporting documentation or certified copies \nas part of the application. If copies are provided with the application, originals must be \nproduced at interview if requested.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n8 \n \nThe applicant will need to provide certified translations in English or French, and an \ninterpreter, as required. The interpreter must be a professional, and not a friend, relative, \nemployee, lawyer or consultant of the applicant.  \n5.5 Interviews  \nMembers of the business immigrant class may or may not be called to an interview; this puts \nthem on a par with other classes of immigrants.  \n \nWhere the documentation submitted with the application clearly establishes eligibility, \nand the officer is satisfied it is authentic, waiving the interview may be appropriate. Local \nexperience will drive office interview policy. \n \nWhere it clearly establishes that the applicant is not an entrepreneur within the meaning \nof R88(1), officers will refuse as per R97(2). \n5.6 Interviewing family members  \nOfficers may require the family members’ presence, if necessary, for the purpose of assessing \nthe application. This applies whether or not they will accompany the principal applicant to \nCanada.  \nNote: As per A15, officers have the authority to hold the interview of the principal applicant and \nany family members (if interviewed) at the visa office or at any other appropriate location. There \nare no limitations upon what is considered appropriate, but the officer should have reasons for \nrequiring the presence of family members at an interview.  \nNote: As always, all statutory requirements must be met before a visa may be issued, including \nmedical, criminal, security, truthfulness and proof of relationship to the family members.  \n5.7 Provincial programs  \nOfficers are obliged to apply the regulatory definition of \"entrepreneur.” There are, however, \nprovincial nominee programs that may select persons with a business background, and, who are \nnot subject to the federal “entrepreneur” definition.  \nThe provincial nominee programs reflect provincial or territorial priorities, experience and \nknowledge of local conditions.  \n5.8 Cost recovery fees and Right of Permanent Residence Fee (RPRF)  \nThe cost recovery fee is payable at the time the application is made and is not refundable. The \ncost recovery fee must only be charged for persons who intend to immigrate to Canada.  \nThe RPRF is only refundable, upon request, to applicants who do not obtain permanent resident \nstatus. RPRF is also only for persons who intend to immigrate to Canada.  \nSuccessful applicants who decide not to use their visa must return the visa to the visa office in \norder to obtain a RPRF refund. Unsuccessful applicants should be informed as part of the refusal \nletter that they are entitled to a RPRF refund, if the RPRF has been paid. The visa office that \nfinalized a case is responsible for processing any related RPRF refund.  \nNon-accompanying family members do not pay these fees even though they must undergo \nstatutory processing.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n9 \n5.9 Request to change category  \nThere is no regulatory authority to change categories once an application has been made. R97(2) \ndescribes minimal requirements for entrepreneurs and R100(2) describes minimal requirements \nfor self-employed. The direction contained in the two paragraphs of the Regulations is clear. If \nthe applicant does not meet the definition then the application is refused.  \n5.10 Effect of changing categories on cost recovery fees  \nAs indicated in the above paragraph, there is no provision to change categories.  \n5.11 Releasing information to provinces and territories  \nRequests for information from the provinces and territories should be accommodated, subject to \nthe provisions of the Privacy Act and Access to Information Act. Provinces and territories wish to \nbe kept informed of visas issued to business immigrants destined to their area. A number of \nprovinces have negotiated MOUs to facilitate the exchange of information.  \nThe MOUs allow CIC to provide on a quarterly basis copies of the Applications for Permanent \nResidence in Canada, IMM 0008EGEN and Personal Worth Statement or Business Applicant \nSummary. As well, the entrepreneur’s overseas address and contact address in Canada are \nincluded. This information allows the provinces to assist and monitor entrepreneurs before and \nafter arrival.  \n5.12 Requesting and reviewing documentation—general (A16)  \nOfficers may request documentation to support the applicant's application. The officer should \nexamine the documentation with the following elements in mind:  \n \nthe documentation requested should primarily provide evidence about the applicant's \nfinancial position and previous entrepreneurial background; \n \nthe officer should actively discourage the submission of a formal business plan. There is \nno basis in law to require an entrepreneur to undertake a specific business activity or to \nlocate in a specific area. \n5.13 Processing priority  \nOfficers should accord the same processing priority to business immigrants as to other categories \nof immigrants. Applicants must understand that their application will not receive special \nconsideration because they may have chosen to be represented by a lawyer or consultant. \nLawyers and consultants representing business applicants should comply with the same \nstandards applying to third-party representatives in any other kind of immigration case.  \n5.14 Applying procedural fairness  \nWhen the officer has concerns about eligibility or admissibility, the applicant must be given a fair  \nopportunity to correct or contradict those concerns. The applicant must be given an opportunity \nto rebut the content of any negative provincial assessment that may influence the final decision.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n10 \nThe officer has an obligation to provide a thorough and fair assessment in compliance with the \nterms and spirit of the legislation and procedural fairness requirements.  \n5.15 File retention and disposal  \nThe records of successful entrepreneurs must be retained for three years from the date of visa \nissuance.  \nRecords of refused applicants must be retained five years from the date of final disposition.  \n5.16 CAIPS records  \nThe visa office should make its microfilmed or CAIPS records available to inland offices upon \nrequest, subject to the Privacy Act. Information from the visa office may assist in determining \nwhether there has been any misrepresentation on the application for permanent residence. \nA40(1)(a) and A41(a) give inland officers the authority to gather the information they deem \nnecessary for the purpose of assessing an \"Application to cancel conditions—Entrepreneur” \n(IMM 5344B)”. The officer may also require information when contemplating enforcement action \nagainst an entrepreneur for non-compliance with conditions imposed.  \nThe Business Immigration Division at NHQ has access to CAIPS. The Division will review case \nnotes from time to time, following contact with a province or a visa office. This will assist NHQ to \nmonitor entrepreneurs who fail to meet their conditions.  \n6 Definitions  \n6.1 Audits  \nThe objective of an audit is to express an opinion as to whether the financial statements present \nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles. This is the highest form of assurance. The auditor performs the audit with \nan attitude of professional scepticism and seeks reasonable assurance whether the financial \nstatements are free of material misstatement.  \nIn Canada it would be unusual for a small private business to have an audit. The Canadian \nBusiness Corporations Act requires an audit if sales exceed $10,000,000; but even in that case, \nif the company is closely held, it can waive the audit requirement.  \n6.2 Balance sheet  \nWhat is referred to as the balance sheet's accounting equation is:  \n \nassets (the total money invested in the company) =  \n \nliabilities (the money supplied by creditors) plus \n \nowners' equity (money supplied by owners)and retained earnings \nAny asset or liability that will be converted into cash within one year is defined as \"current\" and \nthe difference between current assets and current liabilities provides some indication of a \ncompany's liquidity and solvency.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n11 \nThe balance sheet provides a snapshot in time (usually at the business's year-end). Assuming \nthat the information provided is accurate, it provides an indication of the assets available to \nconduct business operations and an indication of the scope of operations.  \nA series of balance sheets can reveal the soundness of the company's structure. Officers should \nwatch for a decline in sales and increase in inventory, as this tends to indicate a downward trend \nfor the business.  \nWhen reviewing the balance sheet, it should be remembered that it is based on transactions. As \na result, it discloses a book value that may not correspond to the market value of an enterprise. \nFor example, fixed assets will be recorded at historical cost less an estimate for depreciation that \nmay not bear any resemblance to fair market value. This is especially true with land since fair \nmarket value may be many times the original cost.  \n6.3 Business experience (R88)  \nFor an entrepreneur, this means the management of a qualifying business and control of a \npercentage of equity for a specific time frame as outlined in R88. Further explanation is \ncontained in Section 8.5 to Section 8.11 below.  \n6.4 Compilation engagements  \nCompilation engagements are engagements in which a public accountant receives information \nfrom a client and arranges it into the form of a financial statement. The public accountant is \nconcerned that the assembly of information is arithmetically correct; however, the public \naccountant does not attempt to verify the accuracy or completeness of the information provided.  \n6.5 Entrepreneur  \nAn entrepreneur is a foreign national who:  \na) has business experience;  \nb) has a legally obtained net worth of at least $300,000 [R88(1)];  \nc) provides a written statement to an officer that they intend and will be able to meet the \nconditions referred to in subsection R98(1) to (4), specifically, that for a period of at least one \nyear within a period of not more than three years after the day that the entrepreneur becomes a \npermanent resident they intend and will be able to:  \ni) control a percentage of the equity of a qualifying Canadian business equal to or greater \nthan 33 1/3 %;  \nii) provide active and ongoing management of the qualifying Canadian business; and  \niii) create at least one incremental full-time job equivalent in that business for Canadian \ncitizens or permanent residents, other than the entrepreneur and their family members.  \n6.6 Financial statements  \nA complete set of financial statements generally includes:  \n \nbalance sheet. See Balance sheet, Section 6.2 above;\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n12 \n \nincome statement (or \"Statement of Income and Retained Earnings\"). See Income \nstatement, Section 6.8 below;  \n \nstatement of cash flows; and  \n \nnotes to the financial statements.  \n6.7 Full-time job equivalent  \n“Full-time equivalent” means 1950 hours per year of paid employment [R88] and may consist of \neither one person working full-time, or several people working the equivalent of a full-time \nposition [R98(1)(c)].  \n6.8 Income statement  \nThe income statement measures a company's sales (revenue), expenses and earnings over a \nspecified time period, usually one year. It provides an indication of the scope of operations \n(along with the balance sheet).  \nThe income statement is a good indicator of a company's financial performance. Earnings and \ntrends in earnings are the best indicators of a company's financial well-being. Changes or trends \nin financial position should indicate whether the company is growing or declining.  \nThe income statement should help the officer determine the company's net book value (if the \nbusiness were to be sold, how much would it realize?) and the number of its employees (from \nthe wage and salary expenses).  \nIn some cases, small businesses may only be able to produce an income statement generated \nspecifically for tax purposes.  \n6.9 “Net worth”  \n“Net worth” in this context is the fair market value of all assets minus the fair market value of all \nliabilities of the applicant and his spouse or common law/conjugal partner.  \n6.10 Percentage of equity  \nThis refers to varying degrees of ownership of equity in a business, depending on whether it is a \nsole proprietorship, a corporation, or a partnership or joint venture. See Section 8.11 below.  \n6.11 Personal net worth statement  \nThe personal net worth statement includes both business and personal assets and liabilities of \nthe applicant as well as those of the spouse or common-law partner/conjugal partner.  \n6.12 Qualifying business  \nThis is a business—other than one operated for the purpose of deriving investment income—for \nwhich there is documentary proof of a specific equity/full-time job equivalent/net asset \nrelationship in a specific time frame, as set out in R88 and explained in Section 8.7 below. The \nterm refers to a business already managed by the applicant at the time of application.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n13 \n6.13 Qualifying Canadian business  \nThis is a business operated in Canada for which there is in any year documentary evidence of a \nspecific equity/full-time job equivalent/net asset relationship in a specific time frame, as set out \nin R88 and explained in section 8.7 below.  \n6.14 Review engagements  \nReview engagements are distinguishable from audits in that the scope of review is less than that \nof an audit and therefore the level of assurance provided is lower. A review consists primarily of \nenquiry, analytical procedures and discussions related to information supplied to the public \naccountant by the enterprise with the limited objective of assessing whether information being \nreported on is plausible within the framework of appropriate criteria.  \n6.15 Self-employed (R88)  \nA “self-employed person” means a foreign national who has relevant experience and has the \nintention and ability to be self-employed in Canada and to make a significant contribution to \nspecified economic activities in Canada. \n“Relevant experience” in respect of  \na) a self-employed person, other than a self-employed person selected by a province, means a \nminimum of two years of experience, during the period beginning five years before the date of \napplication for a permanent resident visa and ending on the day a determination is made in \nrespect of the application, consisting of \ni) in respect of cultural acitivities, \n(A) two one-year periods of experience in self-employment in cultural acitivities, \n(B) two one-year periods of experience in participation at a world class level in cultural \nactivities, or \n(C) a combination of a one-year period of experience described in clause (A) and a one-\nyear period of experience described in clause (B), \nii) in respect of athletics, \n(A) two one-year periods of experience in self-employment in athletics, \n(B) two one-year periods of experience in participation at a world class level in athletics, or \n(C) a combination of a one-year period of experience described in clause (A) and a one-\nyear period of experience described in clause B),and \niii) in respect of the purchase and management of a farm, two one-year periods of \nexperience in the management of a farm  \nb) a self-employed person selected by a province, has the meaning provided by the law of the \nprovince. \nSpecified economic activities in respect of a self-employed person, other than a self-employed \nperson selected by a province, means cultural activities, athletics or purchasing and managing a \nfarm. A self-employed person selected by a province has the meaning provided by the law of the \nprovince. \n7 Procedures: General guidelines for assessing eligibility\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n14 \nThe following sections outline procedures officers will follow to assess the eligibility of \nentrepreneurs and self-employed applicants.  \nFor more information, see:  \n \nForms required, section 7.1 below; \n \nRoles and responsibilities for processing entrepreneurs and self-employed persons, \nsection 7.2 below; \n \nPre-application counselling, Section 8.1 below; \n \nAssessing eligibility, Section 8.4 below; \n \nAssessing admissibility, Section 8.15 below; \n \nAllowing early entry, Section 8.36; \n \nIssuing the visa, Section 9; \n \nEntrepreneurs destined to Quebec, Section 10; \n \nRefusal of an entrepreneur application, Section 8.33. \n7.1 Forms required  \nSchedule 6, together with the IMM 0008EGEN, provides information on the applicant's business \nand educational background.  \nNote: Missions may wish to tailor additional forms that are location-specific.  \n7.2 Roles and responsibilities for processing entrepreneurs and self-\nemployed persons  \nThis section outlines:  \n \nthe roles and responsibilities of officers at the visa office in processing applications, \nselecting, and counselling applicants in the entrepreneur and self-employed categories; \n \nthe roles and responsibilities of provincial and territorial officials with respect to \napplicants in the entrepreneur and self-employed categories. \nOfficer roles and responsibilities at visa offices with respect to entrepreneurs \nIndividual or \ngroup  \nResponsibility  \nComments  \nOfficer at visa \noffices abroad  \nDetermine whether potential \nentrepreneurs meet the definition set \nout in R88.  \nIf yes, the applicant is \"eligible\" and \nassessment for admissibility may \nproceed  \n   \nAssess the applicant's admissibility in \nthe entrepreneur category.  \n   \n   \nProvide counselling, as operational \nexigencies permit, on the program.  \nOfficer may:  \n  provide information about the \nconditions imposed on all \nentrepreneurs; \n  recommend exploratory visits to \nCanada; \n  refer the client to useful contacts \nboth abroad and in Canada. \n   \nIssue visas to the applicant and\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n15 \nfamily members who meet the \nselection criteria and the statutory \nrequirements.  \n   \nExplain the conditions of permanent \nresidence imposed on all \nentrepreneurs and their family \nmembers.  \n   \n   \nProvide the entrepreneur with \ninformation related to the permanent \nresidence and monitoring process.  \nThis information may include:  \n  the Monitoring and Counselling \nGuide which provides details on the \nreporting requirements; \n  a mail-in card used for the first \nreporting period; \n  the form to cancel conditions; and  \n  a list of federal and provincial \nbusiness immigrant contacts who can \nhelp the entrepreneur comply with \nconditions. \nOfficer roles and responsibilities at visa offices with respect to self-employed \ncandidates \nIndividual or \ngroup  \nResponsibility  \nComments  \nOfficer at \nmissions \nabroad  \nDetermine whether applicants in the self-\nemployed category meet the definition set \nout in R88.  \nIf yes, the applicant is \"eligible\" \nand assessment for \nadmissibility may proceed.  \n   \nAssess the applicant's admissibility in the \nself-employed category.  \n   \n   \nIssue visas to the applicant and family \nmembers who meet the selection criteria \nand the statutory requirements.  \n   \n7.3 Roles played by provincial and territorial officials (excluding \nQuebec)  \nThe federal, provincial and territorial governments all encourage prospective business \nimmigrants to invest in Canada. In recognition of the important role provinces play in the \nbusiness immigration program, adaptability points are awarded for exploratory visits and \nparticipation in federal-provincial business immigration initiatives. \nIndividual or \ngroup  \nRole  \nComments  \nProvinces and \nterritories:  \nDesignate officials who \nspecialize in the \nentrepreneur program  \nSome provinces and territories wish to become \ninvolved with entrepreneurs prior to their \napplication. Others do so from the point of \napplication onward. Still others are primarily \ninterested in assisting entrepreneurs once they \nhave become permanent residents.  \n   \nArrange activities in \nCanada to assist\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n16 \nentrepreneurs before or \nafter becoming \npermanent residents.  \n   \nRespond to written \ninquiries from potential \napplicants.  \n   \n   \nOffer seminars or \ncounselling sessions.  \n   \n   \nEngage in various \npromotion and marketing \nactivities.  \n   \n   \nSend officers abroad to \nrecruit applicants and \nprovide information about \ndoing business in Canada.  \n   \n   \nReview proposals if \nrequested by applicant  \nWhile not considered in the selection process, \nbusiness proposals may be presented to provincial \nofficials for comment.  \n   \nMonitor performance.  \n   \nSome \nprovinces and \nterritories may  \nPrefer more limited \ncontacts with the visa \noffice.  \nThey may be likely to communicate with visa \noffices only on high priority or urgent cases. They \nmay wish to review only contentious, questionable \nor high profile cases.  \nProvincial and \nterritorial \nofficials may  \nProvide various services \nonce permanent residence \nhas been granted.  \nThese services may include:  \n  providing counselling and assistance to \nentrepreneurs in setting up their businesses after \nthey have become permanent residents; \n  assisting in the monitoring of entrepreneurs; \n  providing their views to inland officials about \nthe value of an entrepreneur's investment in \nCanada, its economic contribution or other \naspects of compliance with the conditions. \n7.4 Roles and responsibilities in processing Quebec cases  \nThe province of Quebec has signed an agreement with the federal government pursuant to A8, \nand A9, under which it has the right to select its own foreign nationals who intend to reside in \nthat province as permanent residents. All these persons are therefore selected pursuant to the \nCanada-Quebec Accord on Immigration. \nIndividual or \ngroup  \nResponsibility  \nComments  \nQuebec \nofficials  \nare responsible for the \nselection of \nentrepreneurs intending \nto settle in Quebec.  \nImmigration is a shared jurisdiction under the \nConstitution Act. Quebec under the Accord can select \nentrepreneurs.  \nFederal \nofficials  \nevaluate inadmissibility \n(A33-A41);  \nWhile Quebec can impose conditions and determine \ncompliance, federal officials perform these functions.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n17 \nissue visas;  \ngrant permanent \nresidence.  \nimpose conditions;  \ndetermine compliance \nwith conditions;  \ncarry out enforcement \naction.  \nFederal \nofficials and \nQuebec \nofficials  \nmay chose to work \ntogether, on occasion, \nto monitor \nentrepreneurs in \nQuebec.  \nThis understanding is between la Direction de l'aide à \nl'immigration d'affaires (DAIA) du ministère des \nAffaires internationales, de l'Immigration et des \nCommunautés culturelles (MAIICCQ) and CIC \nRegional office in Montreal. The final decision \nconcerning compliance remains with the federal \ngovernment.  \n8 Processing entrepreneurs  \nOperational pressures have limited the opportunity to provide counselling.  \n8.1 Pre-application counselling  \nIdeally, and as exigencies permit, officers may provide information to the prospective \nentrepreneur prior to receiving the application. The officer could for example:  \n \ndiscuss with the applicant the possibility of an exploratory visit to Canada; and  \n \nensure the applicant has all the documentation required. \n8.2 Encouraging exploratory visits  \nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act encourages investors and entrepreneurs to make \nexploratory visits to Canada and grants assessment points for doing so.  \nOfficers, when time allows, and when appropriate, could:  \n \nencourage prospective entrepreneurs to make an exploratory visit to Canada before \napplying for permanent residence. The visit gives the applicant the opportunity to acquire \nfirst-hand knowledge about living and doing business in Canada;  \n \ninform the applicant that the provinces and territories strongly encourage this practice. \nSome provide services to potential entrepreneurs at this time, such as information \nseminars or individual consultations;  \n \nencourage the applicant to contact provincial officials well in advance of any exploratory \nvisit, to obtain information on services available.  \nNote: Officers must also take into account the bona fides of the applicant when encouraging the \nindividual to undertake an exploratory visit to Canada.  \n8.3 Ensuring that the applicant has all the necessary documentation to \nmake the application\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n18 \nOfficers should ensure that:  \n \nin addition to the usual counselling material, the information package given to a \nprospective applicant includes clear information on what supporting documentation will \nbe needed to assess an applicant's ability to meet the definition of an entrepreneur.  \nNote: Schedule 6 is the attachment to the IMM 0008EGEN that provides an overview of an \napplicant’s financial picture.  \n8.4 Assessing eligibility: selection criteria  \nTo be approved as an entrepreneur, the applicant must:  \n \nmeet the regulatory definition of an entrepreneur; and  \n \nmeet the selection criteria for the entrepreneur class. \nThis section outlines the elements an officer must consider to determine whether the regulatory \ndefinition of \"entrepreneur\" is met.  \nR97(2) mandates the refusal of any application where the applicant does not meet the regulatory \ndefinition of \"entrepreneur\". If it is clear that an applicant does not meet the definition, no \nfurther analysis is required.  \n8.5 Does the applicant meet the regulatory definition of \n\"entrepreneur\"?  \nThe officer must determine whether the applicant meets the regulatory definition, which consists \nof three distinct criteria. Unless selected by a province, the entrepreneur must:  \n1. have business experience; \n2. have a legally obtained minimum net worth of $300,000; and \n3. provide a written statement to an officer that they intend and will be able to meet the \nconditions referred to in subsections R98(1) to (5). \n8.6 What is \"business experience\"?  \nThe Regulations set out three clear criteria which must be met for the applicant's business \nexperience to be satisfactory to an officer:  \n \nqualifying business; \n \ntime; \n \nrole. \n8.7 What is a \"qualifying business\"?  \n\"Business experience\" must have taken place in a \"qualifying business,\" defined as a business:  \n \nwhich is not a business for deriving investment income (interest, dividend, or capital \ngains); and  \n \nfor which documentary evidence of the applicant's participation in the business must be \nprovided for at least two of the following attributes:\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n19 \nBusiness participation attributes \nATTRIBUTE     \nMultiplied by:  \nEqual or greater than  \n1  \nPercentage of equity  Full-time job equivalents  \n2 full-time job equivalents  \n2  \nPercentage of equity  Total annual sales($)  \n$ 500,000  \n3  \nPercentage of equity  Annual net income($)  \n$ 50,000  \n4  \nPercentage of equity  Net assets  \n$ 125,000  \nR89 refers to “artificial transactions” which are not acceptable. An artificial transaction is \nconsidered to be any transaction designed to ensure compliance with program requirements, \nunless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken for bona fide \npurposes other than to obtain such compliance; for example, a change in corporate structure \nwhen the primary purpose is to meet the qualifying business definition. \nIn the past, officers were instructed to assess each business in which an applicant holds a \npercentage of equity, and if no single business could satisfy the requirements, then the \ndefinition of \"qualifying business\" was deemed to have not been met. \nHowever, in Thomas v. MCI (FCC 2006), the judge held that visa officers commit a reviewable \nerror when they fail to consider the aggregate financial result from all of an applicant's \nbusinesses. \nTherefore, when assessing an Entrepreneur or Investor applicant's \"business experience,\" where \napplicable, visa officers should consider the aggregate financial information of more than one \nbusiness. This can be done using the same calculation-the percentage of equity held by the \napplicant/spouse multiplied by the variables concerned (annual sales, net income, full-time \nequivalents and net assets). However, when determining whether the applicant has managed a \n\"qualifying business,\" the sum of these calculations for all businesses will be the figure compared \nagainst the minimum thresholds found in R88(1). \nIt is anticipated that the majority of Investor and Entrepreneur applicants will rely on a single \nbusiness or, in the case of Investor applicants, choose to declare management experience in \norder to demonstrate \"business experience.\" \nGiven the potential workload implications, such aggregate assessments should be made only \nwhere they are clearly relevant to the selection decision, such as a decision to refuse the \napplicant. \nExample: \nAn applicant owns a percentage of equity in three businesses with the following characteristics: \n \nCompany \nA \nApplicant's \nShare \nCompany \nB \nApplicant's \nShare \nCompany \nC \nApplicant's \nShare \nTotal: \n (A)+(B)+ \n(C) \nMinimum \nRequired \nby R88(1) \nMin. \nMet? \n% of \nEquity \n33% \n  \n50% \n  \n25% \n  \n  \n  \n  \nSales \n $ \n75,000   24,750  \n $200,000   100,000  \n $500,000   125,000  \n $249,750   250,000  \nX \nNet \nAssets \n $ \n56,000   18,480  \n $125,000   62,500  \n $250,000   62,500  \n $143,480   $  125,000  \n√ \nNet \nIncome \n $ \n12,000   3,960  \n $ 45,000   22,500  \n $ 50,000   12,500  \n $ 38,960   50,000  \nX \nFTEs \n3 \n1 \n4 \n2 \n4 \n1 \n4 \n2 \n√\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n20 \nAs this example illustrates, the definition of \"qualifying business\" is not successfully met by any \none business on its own. However, when one considers the aggregate total for the applicant's \nshare of sales, net assets, net income and full-time equivalents in all three businesses, the \ndefinition is met. \n8.8 What role must the entrepreneur have played?  \nThe entrepreneur’s role in the business must have been management and control of a \npercentage of the equity of the qualifying business according to the following table (the \nentrepreneur must provide documentary evidence for at least two attributes out of four):  \nPercentage of equity in a qualifying business \nATTRIBUTE  \n% OF EQUITY  \n   \n100 %  \n50 %  \n33.33 %  \nEmployment  \n2  \n4  \n6  \nTotal annual sales ($)  \n500,000  \n1,000,000  \n1,500,000  \nAnnual net income($)  \n50,000  \n100,000  \n150,000  \nNet assets at yearend  \n125,000  \n250,000  \n375,000  \n8.9 Calculating percentage of equity for Entrepreneur applicants  \nIn order to determine the percentage of equity controlled by an Entrepreneur applicant (and \ntheir spouse, where applicable) it may be necessary to look beyond the legal, or de jure, control \nof the shares in the qualifying business. \nIn certain circumstances legal control of a portion of the qualifying business' equity may rest with \nanother individual—but may still be considered part of the applicant's percentage of equity. For \nexample, in jurisdictions where the law precludes non-citizens from legally controlling a majority \ninterest in a business, other documents may exist, such as trust or licensing agreements, that \nbetter reflect the effective or de facto control of the business. \nIn many of the Gulf States, non-citizen applicants legally own 49% of the capital stock of a \ncorporation, with agreements stipulating full control over the assets, obligations and profits of \nthe corporation in return for a small licensing fee to the Gulf national or 51% shareholder. In \nsuch a scenario, the equity percentage for the \"qualifying business\" calculation would be 100%.  \nWhere there are serious concerns that such documents or agreements were produced solely for \nthe purposes of satisfying Immigration requirements, an officer must be satisfied that the \napplicant has not engaged in an artificial transaction [R89]. However, these agreements should \nalways be considered within the local context, as the legal environment in certain countries can \nmake them a necessity for a non-citizen operating a business \n8.10 What is the time factor?  \nFor the applicant's business experience to count, it must have been accumulated in one-year \nperiods during the period beginning five years before the date of application and ending when a \ndetermination is made.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n21 \n8.11 Other aspects of the regulatory definition to consider when \nassessing the eligibility of an entrepreneur  \nThe applicant must provide a written statement to an officer that for a period of at least one year \nand within three years of becoming a permanent resident, the entrepreneur intends and is able \nto:  \n \ncontrol a percentage of the equity of a qualifying Canadian business equal to or greater \nthan 33.3%; \n \nprovide active and ongoing management of the qualifying Canadian business; and \n \ncreate at least one incremental full-time job equivalent in that business for Canadian \ncitizens or permanent residents, other than the entrepreneur and their family members. \n8.12 Controlling a percentage of the equity of a qualifying Canadian \nbusiness equal to or greater than 33.3%  \nThe entrepreneur, once in Canada, is required to control at least 1/3 of a qualifying Canadian \nbusiness (see R88) in Canada.  \nThe entrepreneur must hold a clearly defined degree of control in the business as the table below \nsets forth:  \nPercentage of equity in a qualifying business \nATTRIBUTE  \n% OF EQUITY  \n   \n100 %  \n50 %  \n33.33 %  \nEmployment  \n2  \n4  \n6  \nTotal annual sales ($)  \n250,000  \n500,000  \n750,000  \nAnnual net income($)  \n25,000  \n50,000  \n75,000  \nNet assets at year-end  \n125,000  \n250,000  \n375,000  \n8.13 Counselling applicants as to conditions of permanent residence \nand qualifying Canadian business  \nOfficers should keep in mind the following when describing the conditions of permanent \nresidence to applicants.  \nIn order to satisfy the requirement of active and on-going participation in the management of \nthe business, the entrepreneur must demonstrate input into management decisions through \ninvolvement in the operations of the business on a continuing basis.  \nCIC Business Centres will consider the following points when making their assessment:  \n \neach case should be judged on its own merits. It should be noted that it is not required \nthat the entrepreneur be present each and every day;  \n \nartificial transactions as described in R89 and referenced in Section 8.7 above are not \nacceptable;\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n22 \n \npassive investment in real estate, bonds or other securities, or other investments made \nprimarily with the hope of capital appreciation, would not satisfy the requirement of \nqualifying Canadian business; \n \nan entrepreneur who enters into franchise agreements or into partnership agreements \nwith other entrepreneurs must meet all the provisions of the program, including the \nguidelines defining the minimum degree of control over a qualifying Canadian business \nand active and ongoing management. An arrangement where one partner funds a \npartnership and another provides the business expertise would not be satisfactory.  \n \na review of jurisprudence has established that a professional practice constitutes \"a \nbusiness.” It does not matter whether or not the professional devotes more time to \nproviding services to clients than to managing the practice. Such persons will, of course, \nhave to show that they have created at least one full-time job equivalent in Canada \nthrough their company in order to have conditions removed.  \n8.14 Creating at least one incremental full-time job equivalent in the \nqualifying Canadian business  \nAn entrepreneur must create at least one incremental full-time job equivalent for one or more \nCanadian citizens or permanent residents, other than the entrepreneur and their family \nmembers. The entrepreneur must meet the above conditions for a period of at least one year \nwithin a three-year period after becoming a permanent resident.  \nRetaining the services of accountants, lawyers, or business consultants on a fee-for-service basis \ndoes not create employer-employee relationships.  \n8.15 Making the eligibility decision  \nBased on a review of the above elements of the application, the officer will either:  \n \ndetermine that the applicant is not eligible and refuse the case; or \n \ndetermine that the applicant meets the regulatory definition and proceed to examine the \ncase according to the selection criteria. \n8.16 Assessing eligibility: selection criteria  \nThis section outlines the procedures an officer must follow in assessing an applicant against the \nselection criteria for entrepreneurs, once the regulatory definition has been satisfied.  \nThe officer must assess the applicant against the selection criteria for entrepreneurs by \nexamining the applicant's business and financial background. The IRPA provides an extensive \ntool set to officers to ensure program integrity. A16(1) obliges applicants to answer truthfully \nand A40 deals with misrepresentation. A36 and A37 respond to criminality.  \n8.17 Applying the selection criteria for entrepreneurs  \nIf an officer is satisfied that the applicant meets the regulatory definition of “entrepreneur,” the \napplicant is assessed on a selecton grid. The applicant will require 35 points out of a maximum of \n100 available, as determined by the Minister.  \nThe following grid outlines the criteria against which to assess the applicant and the points to be \nawarded:\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n23 \nENTREPRENEURS: Selection factors and maximum points  \nBUSINESS EXPERIENCE*  \nMaximum 35  \nFive years’ business experience  \n35  \nFour years’ business experience  \n30  \nThree years’ business experience  \n25  \nTwo years’ business experience  \n20  \n* within five years preceding date of application.

Under \nthe terms of the Canada-Quebec Accord, Quebec selects its own business immigrants.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n24 \nNote: Adaptability points require that the province of destination provide the applicant with \ndocumentation indicating that one or both of the elements have been met.  \n8.18 Substitution of evaluation  \nR109 applies if, in the officer's opinion, there are good reasons why the points awarded do not \nreflect the chances of the foreign national and their family members becoming economically \nestablished in Canada. Substitution of evaluation (positive or negative discretion) may be used \nfor economic reasons, i.e., involving the ability to support oneself. The officer must under \nR109(2) obtain the concurrence of a second officer. In 1995, the Supreme Court confirmed that \nthis discretionary authority is restricted to successful establishment in the economic sense.  \n8.19 Documentation and provenance of funds concerns  \nBusiness immigrants require a net worth as well as business experience. Officers have authority \nto require evidence to establish an applicant’s admissibility and the power to reject an applicant \nfor failing to discharge the obligation.  \nA16(1) imposes the obligation on applicants “to answer truthfully” and “produce … all relevant \nevidence and documents” reasonably required by the officer. A11(1) requires that a visa may \nonly be granted if the officer “is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets \nthe requirements of the Act.”  \nThe IRPA provides broad grounds to reject applicants. A40(1)(a) provides for the rejection of \napplicants for misrepresentation of a material fact, namely \"for directly or indirectly \nmisrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could \ninduce an error in the administration of this Act.\" A41(a) provides officers authority to find \napplicants inadmissible for \"an act or omission which contravenes directly or indirectly a \nprovision of this Act.\" The IRPA provides officers with the tools to reasonably require evidence to \nestablish admissibility A16(1); to refuse the applicant when not satisfied as they are not \ninadmissible A11(1); or to refuse when provided with false material information relating, among \nother things, to control and ownership of the business and net worth A40(1)(a) . Similarly, \nofficers may refuse applicants under A41 for any act or omission.  \nA common practice of organized crime is to present a legally sound business as a front for \ncriminal activity. The Regulations ensure officers can go beyond the specific requirements of the \nqualifying business and net worth to examine their context. This can be achieved by obliging \napplicants to establish the legality of their assets. In this manner officers can reasonably require \nevidence to establish the legality of assets and can refuse applicants who do not comply A16(1), \ndo not meet the presumption A11(1), or who purposely dissemble A40(1)(a). This is achieved by \nrequiring that entrepreneurs’ and investors’ “net worth be legally obtained.”  \nThe risks of applying a “legally obtained” provision poorly and inaccurately can lead to poor case \ndecisions and jurisprudence. Its successful use places a significant evidentiary burden on the \nofficer. A legally sustainable refusal will also have to deal with issues of defining both “legal” and \n“obtained.” To meet the policy objective, the provision for legally obtained net worth provides a \ncontext to examine the provenance of funds that can support sustainable rejections under A11.  \nProviding a regulatory obligation for business applicants to establish the \nlegality of their net worth:  \n \nprovides clear rules and expectations for clients and officials;  \n \nserves as a deterrent;\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n25 \n \nprovides the legal context for officers to examine the provenance of funds of business \nimmigrants and to make legally sustainable refusals. \nRelevant documents include:  \n \npersonal net worth statement;  \n \nbusiness balance sheet;  \n \nbusiness financial statements;  \n \ncorporate employee payroll. \nThese documents provide an accounting of the applicant's assets and liabilities and help the \nofficer to determine whether the applicant has the required business experience. They are \ndiscussed in the following sections.  \n8.20 Personal net worth statement  \nThe Regulations set out a requirement for a legally obtained minimum net worth of $300,000, \nalthough there is no requirement for a minimum amount to be transferred to Canada.  \n8.21 What should be included in a personal net worth statement  \nA personal worth statement is included in form IMM 0008Esch6.  \nThe personal net worth statement includes both business and personal assets and liabilities of \nthe applicant as well as those of the spouse or common-law /conjugal partner.  \nOfficers should:  \n \nreview this document to satisfy themselves as to the completeness, valuation, ownership, \nexistence and presentation of the component assets and liabilities; \n \nrequire applicants to provide documentation to support the value of assets referred to on \nthis statement (bank statements, property valuations, etc.); \no \nfunds may be in non-convertible currencies;  \no \nexchange controls may restrict movement of capital to Canada;  \n8.22 Business balance sheet and business income statement (financial \nstatements)  \nFor the purposes of assessing the applicant, the most important statements are the balance \nsheet and income statement.  \nOfficers should:  \n \nconsider the performance of the business over time. Financial statements for the previous \nfive years should be provided for comparative purposes and to demonstrate that the \napplicant met the entrepreneur definition in at least two of the previous five years.  \n \nreview the income statement to verify the completeness, measurement, occurrence and \npresentation of the component revenue and expenses;\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n26 \n \nwhen reviewing the income statement, keep in mind that it is based on transactions. \nParticularly in the case of a small enterprise, it is advisable to look at the individual \ncomponents and not simply the net income.  \nFor example, business valuators \"normalize\" income by considering how much has been \nexpended by the owner in salaries and how much would be a reasonable salary to pay an \nemployee to do the same job. An owner may not charge any salary at all and as a consequence \nmay show considerable net income or alternatively allocate a large amount to salary expenses \nand show very little net income or even a loss for tax purposes. It would therefore be in order to \ninquire as to the number of employees and the amount of salary expenses which can be \nattributed to the owner.  \n8.23 Integrity of financial statements  \nOfficers must carefully consider the integrity of the financial statements provided.  \nIn Canada, there are essentially three levels of assurance that a public accountant can provide to \nthe users of financial information:  \n \naudits;  \n \nreview engagements; and  \n \ncompilation engagements.  \nThe majority of small companies or companies that do not have to report to a bank or other \ncreditors will just get a compilation when they get their tax returns professionally prepared.  \nMost countries have a similar range of reporting requirements. In particular, if there has been a \nBritish influence in the past (i.e., Hong Kong), the standards will be very close to ours.  \n8.24 When the veracity of the documentation is in doubt  \nThe officer should:  \n \nfirst request further documentation. In the absence of suspicious circumstances, it will \nordinarily be appropriate to accept financial statements which have been reported on by a \nreputable external accountant. Most small businesses are extremely unlikely to have \nbeen audited; \n \nonly as a last resort, request an additional third-party verification. It should be requested \nonly if: \no \nit has credibility in the applicant's home jurisdiction; and  \no \nits submission could cause you to approve an application which would otherwise \nbe refused. Obtaining third-party verification would be at the applicant's discretion \nif they choose to pursue this option rather than be refused for failure to prove \nthat they meet the definition of entrepreneur.  \n8.25 Reviewing other documentation  \nOfficers should review other supporting documentation as necessary. This documentation may \ninclude:  \n \ncorporate income tax returns; \n \npersonal income tax returns;\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n27 \n \nminute books; \n \nshare certificates;  \n \nmunicipal permits, business licenses, etc.; \n \npayroll lists; \n \nsales taxes; \n \nproperty deeds, land registrations, appraisals, etc.; \n \ngeneral ledger, cash book or bank statements. \n8.26 Corporate income tax returns  \nOfficers may examine tax returns including information on:  \n \nowners and directors;  \n \nrelated parties;  \n \nprofit for income tax purposes;  \n \nduration of operations.  \nNote: Net income (per the financial statements) and taxable income (per the tax return) will \ndiffer as a consequence of the different treatment of certain items such as depreciation. \nHowever, there should be a reconciliation to explain the difference. It would certainly be cause \nfor concern if it appears that different information is being presented for the purposes of financial \nstatements and tax reporting (two sets of books).  \nNote: Inability to produce tax records would be a cause for concern, as would a pattern of \ninsufficient profit to at least provide for the cost of living of the applicant and their family \nmembers.  \nNote: The officer has the authority under section A16(1) to request all relevant evidence and \ndocuments that they reasonably require to assist them in making a selection decision.  \n8.27 Personal income tax returns  \nOfficers may wish to review:  \n \nproprietor's profit and loss;  \n \nsupporting financial statements.  \n8.28 Minute books  \nOfficers may also review:  \n \nshareholders' register;  \n \nshareholders' resolutions;  \n \nminutes of meetings;  \n \narticles of incorporation.  \n8.29 Share certificates  \nA review of share certificates may also provide:  \n \nindication of ownership.  \n8.30 Municipal permits, business licences, etc.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n28 \nOfficers may wish to review municipal permits, business licences and other similar \ndocumentation that should show the type of business organization.  \nMost business undertakings are conducted either as proprietorships, partnerships or corporations \n(legal entities organized for specific purposes with limited liability).  \nAs a general rule, most small businesses start as proprietorships or partnerships and evolve into \ncorporations as the level of business activity expands.  \nMost businesses must be registered or licensed. The business registration certificate shows in \nwhose name a business is registered. Though it may not indicate who owns or operates the \nbusiness, it may give the business address and indicate whether the business is a sole \nproprietorship, a partnership or a corporation.  \n8.31 Payroll records  \nWith rare exceptions, payroll records are essential when determining eligibility for this class of \napplicants.  \n8.32 Sales taxes and property deeds, land registrations, appraisals, etc.  \nOfficers may \n \nrequest a one-year record of bank deposits to verify their long-term ownership; \n \nrequest property deeds or bank letters to verify ownership of property or stocks, amounts \nof outstanding mortgages and banking facilities used.  \nNote: Property appraisals are an extra expense to the applicant and should only be requested if \nthe property value given by the applicant is questionable and this assessment is critical to total \nnet worth.  \n8.33 General ledger, cash book or bank statements  \nOfficers may request supporting accounting records in some circumstances.  \n8.34 Refusal of an entrepreneur application  \nAn applicant must be refused on failure to meet the entrepreneur definition described in R88 for \nsome of the following reasons:  \n \nthe applicant lacks “business experience” because of the two-year qualifying standard; \n \nthe business does not meet the definition of \"qualifying business;”  \n \nthe applicant does not meet the legally obtained minimum net worth standard; \n \nthe applicant refuses to provide a written statement that they intend and have the ability \nto meet the conditions referred to in subsection R98(1) to (5). \nAn applicant described in any of the inadmissibility sections will be refused.  \nNote: A person who applies as a business immigrant is assessed in that class and accepted or \nrefused based on that assessment. Officers are not required to assess a failed business applicant \nas a skilled worker nor in another business class.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n29 \n8.35 Refusal letter  \nThe refusal letter must clearly state all the reasons for refusal in detail. Where information is \nlater presented that should have been disclosed at interview and might have at that time led to a \npositive decision, the officer should invite the applicant (in the absence of special circumstances) \nto submit a new application and pay a new cost recovery fee.  \n8.36 Making the admissibility decision  \nIf the applicant meets selection criteria and is not otherwise inadmissible, the visa office will \nproceed to issue the visa.  \n8.37 Allowing early entry: issuing a temporary resident permit  \nIf a person's presence in Canada is urgently required prior to the finalization of the admission \nprocedures, the officer may issue a temporary resident permit. Officers should remember that:  \n \nthe urgency of the applicant's presence should relate to the creation or possible loss of \njobs for Canadian citizens or permanent residents; \n \na permit should only be issued if they are satisfied that the person has both the intent \nand the ability to comply with all the requirements of the entrepreneur program and is \nunlikely to be inadmissible; \n \nthe permit should be issued only for the period required. Unless there are reasons to \npreclude repeat trips to Canada within the validity of the permit, it should indicate \n\"authorized to leave and re-enter Canada;”  \n \nin cases where provincial officials wish to provide input, officers should obtain their views \nbefore deciding to issue a permit. Officers should also consult these officials before \ndeciding to renew a permit.  \n9 Issuing the visa  \n9.1 Applying conditions  \nConditions are imposed as they are seen by provincial partners to compel economic activity, \nencourage business immigrants to use counselling services provided by the provinces and, \nfinally, allow CIC to track the economic impact of the program.  \nThe imposition of conditions is part of the selection process and, is included in the definition. The \nwritten statement that is provided by the applicants represents an acknowledgment that they \nintend and have the ability to meet the conditions described in R98(1) to (5).  \nThe statement that is signed by the applicant needs to reference the conditions in R98(1) to (5). \nThose sections also identify the applicable time entrepreneurs have to meet conditions and the \nrequirement to provide evidence of efforts to comply.  \nFinally, R98(6) states that family members are subject to the condition that the entrepreneur \nmeets the conditions.  \nThe statement ensures that the entrepreneur fully understands and accepts the requirements.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n30 \nNote: There is a technical requirement to code the permanent resident document indicating that \nconditions have been imposed. The code is 74.  \nNote: Should the permanent resident document holder also be subject to medical surveillance \nthe code is 75.  \n9.2 Providing appropriate counselling documentation  \nOfficers should:  \n \ninclude one copy of the Entrepreneur Counselling and Monitoring Guide with the visa of \neach principal applicant;  \n \nattach to the guide or to the Confirmation of Permanent Resident form (IMM 5509B) a \ncopy of the signed written statement;  \nNote: The guide also contains the mail-in card required to satisfy the first reporting requirement. \nIt provides the list of regional business immigration coordinators where the entrepreneur must \nsend their mail-in card within six months from the date they received permanent resident status.  \n \nprovide other useful material such as the list of provincial business contacts.  \nNote: CAIPS automatically generates and prints the appropriate code and text for EN cases. \nHowever, CAIPS does not automatically generate the written statement.  \n9.3 Completing other key sections of the immigration visa  \nOfficers should ensure that a complete Canadian address is included on the IMM 5509B \n(Confirmation of Permanent Residence). If necessary, request the entrepreneur to provide a \ncontact address in Canada for a friend, relative, lawyer, consultant, accountant or bank \nmanager. This will assist inland offices in tracing the entrepreneur in cases where no mailing card \nis received.  \n9.4 Advising applicants of port of entry procedures  \nThe officer at the port of entry is authorized to grant the right of permanent residence.  \nThe port of entry officer will, in the course of granting the right of permanent residence, suggest \nto the entrepreneur that he contact provincial authorities and remind the entrepreneur of the \nconditions that have been imposed at the visa office.  \nThe port of entry officer will also remind the applicant that under R98(6) family members of an \nentrepreneur are subject to the condition that the entrepreneur meets the conditions. \n10 Entrepreneurs Destined to Quebec  \nThis content has been moved as part of the Department’s efforts to modernize operational \nguidance to staff. It can now be found in the program delivery instructions on permanent \nresidence applications for Quebec economic classes.  \n11 Processing self-employed persons\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n31 \n11.1 Assessing eligibility: selection criteria  \nIn order to be eligible for consideration in the self-employed category, the applicant must first \nmeet the regulatory definition. Most applicants are selected or refused because they meet, or fail \nto meet, the definition.  \n11.2 Does the applicant meet the definition of \"self-employed\"?  \nThe self-employed applicant is one who:  \n \nhas relevant experience; and  \n \nhas the intention and ability to be self–employed in Canada; and \n \nintends to make a significant contribution in specified economic activities as defined in \nthe Regulations through either: \no \nself-employment in cultural activities; \no \nself-employment in athletics, or; \no \nself-employment in the purchase and management of a farm. \n11.3 Determining experience, intention and ability  \nThe officer must consider the following in assessing an applicant's experience, intent and ability \nto create their own employment in Canada:  \n \nSelf-employed experience in cultural activities or athletics. This will capture those \ntraditionally applying in this category. For example, music teachers, painters, illustrators, \nfilm makers, freelance journalists. Beyond that, the category is intended to capture those \npeople who work behind the scenes, for example, choreographers, set designers, coaches \nand trainers. \n \nManagement experience in the world of arts and culture may also be a viable measure of \nself-employment; for example, theatrical or musical directors and impresarios. \n \nA person's financial assets may also be a measure of intent and ability to establish \neconomically in Canada. There is no minimum investment level for a self-employed \nperson. The capital required depends on the nature of the work. Applicants must have \nsufficient funds to create an employment opportunity for themselves and maintain \nthemselves and their family members. They must show you that they have been able to \nsupport themselves and their family through their talents and would be likely to continue \nto do so in Canada. This includes the ability to be self-supporting until the self-\nemployment has been created. \n \nParticipation at a world-class level in cultural activities or athletics intends to capture \nperformers. This describes those who perform in the arts, and in the world of sport. \n“World class” identifies persons who are known internationally. It also identifies persons \nwho may not be known internationally but perform at the highest levels in their \ndiscipline.  \n \nIt is important, when determining an applicant’s intent and ability to purchase and \nmanage a farm, to be aware that farming is a highly skilled and capital-intensive industry \nwith real estate making up 54% of an average farmer’s assets. The Canadian Federation \nof Agriculture (CFA) reports that in Canada the average value of farmland varies \nsignificantly from province to province but ranges from $330 to $4,600 per acre. \nFarmland closest to urban centres has a higher market price. Average farm size varies \nfrom province to province with Newfoundland reporting an average farm size of 146 acres \nwhile Saskatchewan reports an average farm size of 1,152 acres.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n32 \nIn the 1996 census, 98% of farms are family-operated businesses. The CFA advises that “more \nthan ever before, the successful Canadian farmer must be adaptable to the different \nrequirements of running a farm business. The farmer must be able to recognise an animal that is \nill, fix a malfunctioning combine and finish off the day by hooking up to the Internet to check the \nstate of the world markets.”  \nFarming has become a business that requires, in addition to more traditional agricultural skills, a \nworking knowledge of computers and other high-tech equipment. According to the 1996 census, \nmore than 21% of Canadian farm households own one or more computers. There is also a trend \nto higher education in the farm community.  \nIn other words, the successful applicant must meet a rigorous threshold: sufficient capital, \nappropriate experience and appropriate skills.  \n11.4 Making a significant contribution to cultural or artistic life or to \nathletics  \nIt is intended that the self-employed class enrich Canadian culture and sports. In other words, \nwhen applicants meet the test of experience, intent and ability and there is a reasonable \nexpectation they will be self-employed in culture or sport, the test of significant contribution \nbecomes relative. For example, a music teacher destined to a small town can be considered \nsignificant at the local level. Likewise, a freelance journalist who contributes to a Canadian \npublication will meet the test. In the end, the definition of “significant contribution” is left to the \ndiscretion of the officer, but is not intended to bar qualified self-employed persons who are \napplying in good faith. Its inclusion in the definition is intended to bar frivolous applications.  \nNote: If an applicant does not meet the regulatory definition of a self-employed person, R100(2) \nmandates the refusal of the application without further assessment.  \n11.5 Assessing admissibility  \nIf the officer is satisfied that an applicant meets the regulatory definition of a self-employed \nperson, the officer will assess the applicant against the point system for the self-employed class.  \nOfficers will evaluate an applicant's admissibility using the following grid. A self-employed \napplicant requires at least 35 units of assessment for approval of an application, out of a possible \ntotal of 100.  \nSELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS: Selection factors and maximum points  \nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE*  \nMaximum 35  \nFive years’ relevant experience  \n35  \nFour years’ relevant experience  \n30  \nThree years’ relevant experience  \n25  \nTwo years’ relevant experience  \n20  \n* within five years preceding the date of application. \nExperience gained prior to the selection decision is \nalso counted.  \n   \nAGE  \nMaximum 10\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n33 \n21 to 49 years of age, at time of application  \n10  \nLess 2 points for each year of age over 49 years or \nunder 21 years  \n   \nEDUCATION  \nMaximum 25  \n(Doctorate OR Master’s Degree) + 17 years’ full-\ntime or full-time equivalent studies  \n25  \n(3-year Trade Certificate OR LLB or Medical \nDegree)+ 15 years’ full-time or full-time equivalent \nstudies  \n22  \n(Bachelor’s Degree OR 2-year Trade Certificate) + \n14 years’ full-time or full-time equivalent studies  \n20  \n(Bachelor’s Degree or 1-year Trade Certificate) + 13 \nyears’ full-time or full-time equivalent studies  \n15  \n1 year post-secondary + 12 years’ full-time or full-\ntime equivalent studies  \n12  \nSecondary school education  \n5  \nOFFICIAL LANGUAGES  \n1st Language  \n2nd Language  \nMaximum 24  \nHigh proficiency  \n16  \n8  \n   \nModerate proficiency  \n8  \n8  \n   \nBasic proficiency  \n2  \n2  \n   \nNo proficiency  \n0  \n0  \n   \nADAPTABILITY  \nMaximum 6  \nSpouse's or common-law partner's education  \n3 - 5  \nMinimum one year’s full-time authorized work in \nCanada*  \n5  \nMinimum two years’ full-time post-secondary studies \nin Canada*  \n5  \nFamily member in Canada  \n5  \nTOTAL  \nMaximum 100  \n*Applies to either principal applicant or spouse or common-law partner.  \nNote: This point system does not apply to persons who are selected under the Quebec program. \nUnder the terms of the Canada-Quebec Accord, Quebec selects its own business immigrants.  \n11.6 Substitution of evaluation  \nPursuant to R109(1), an officer may issue or refuse a visa regardless of the points obtained if, in \ntheir opinion, the points awarded do not reflect the chances of the foreign national becoming \neconomically established in Canada. The officer must obtain the concurrence of a second officer \nR109(2).\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n34 \n11.7 Requesting and reviewing documentation  \nDocumentation should provide evidence of the applicant's financial position and previous self-\nemployment or experience. It should provide reasonable evidence that the applicant merits \nconsideration under the program.  \nOfficers may request that self-employed applicants show evidence of having researched the \nCanadian labour market and adopted a realistic plan that would reasonably be expected to lead \nto self-employment.  \nHowever, a formal business plan that would entail unnecessary expense and administrative \nburden is discouraged.  \n11.8 Processing self-employed applicants destined for Quebec  \nThis content has been moved as part of the Department’s efforts to modernize operational \nguidance to staff. It can now be found in the program delivery instructions on permanent \nresidence applications for Quebec economic classes.  \n11.9 Making the eligibility decision  \nAfter assessing the applicant's eligibility, the officer will either:  \n \ndetermine that the applicant does not meet the regulatory definition and refuse the \napplication; or \n \ndecide that the applicant is eligible as a self-employed person and proceed to assess \nadmissibility. \nNote: There are no provisions in the Regulations to impose conditions on self-employed \napplicants.  \n11.10 Refusal of self-employed applicants  \nSelf-employed applicants are most often refused pursuant to R100(2) as they do not meet the \nminimal requirements.  \nThe prohibitions as described in the inadmissible section of the IRPA apply in the normal way.  \nA person who applies as a self-employed person should be assessed in that category and \naccepted or refused based on that assessment. An officer is not required to assess a failed \nbusiness applicant in another category, and, in fact, the applicant cannot change categories once \nthe application has been opened.  \n11.11 Refusal letter  \nThe refusal letter must clearly state all the reasons for refusal in detail. A sample refusal letter is \nprovided for general guidance.  \n11.12 Making the admissibility decision\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n35 \nIf the applicant meets selection criteria and is otherwise admissible, the visa office will proceed \nto issue the visa.  \n11.13 Monitoring  \nFile retention and disposal requirements differ slightly from those for entrepreneurs. The records \nof successful self-employed persons must be retained for two years from the date of visa \nissuance (as opposed to three years for entrepreneurs).  \nThere is currently no system in place to monitor self-employed persons in Canada.\nOP 8 Entrepreneur and Self-Employed \n2016-02-23 \n \n36 \nAppendix A Entrepreneur’s letter of acknowledgment  \nTo Canadian Embassy/High Commission/Consulate in  \n(Name of Country)  \nReference: File No. B –  \nI (name of entrepreneur) have applied for a permanent resident visa as a member of the \nentrepreneur class.  \nI intend and have the ability to meet the conditions referred to in section R98, namely, that after \nI become a permanent resident of Canada, I must:  \n(a) control a percentage of equity of a qualifying Canadian business equal to or greater than \n331/3%;  \n(b) provide active and ongoing management of the qualifying Canadian business;  \n(c) create at least one incremental full-time job equivalent for Canadian citizens or permanent \nresidents, other than for myself or my family members;  \n(d) meet these conditions for a period of at least one year within a period of three years after I \nbecome a permanent resident;  \n(e) provide to an officer evidence of compliance with the conditions within the period of three \nyears after the day I become a permanent resident;  \n(f) provide to an officer:  \n \nnot later than six months after the day I become a permanent resident, my residential \naddress and telephone number; and during the period beginning 18 months after and \nending 24 months after the day I become a permanent resident, evidence of my efforts \nto comply with these conditions. \nI also acknowledge and understand that all of my family members are subject to the condition \nthat I meet the above conditions.  \n[SIGNATURE]  \n[DATE]"
