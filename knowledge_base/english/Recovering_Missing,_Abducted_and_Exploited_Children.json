were made to section 7.1, Getting Assistance from Our Missing Children (OMC) Program. Up-\nto-date CBSA contact information is now provided on the CBSA intranet. \n2004-03-08  \nIt is to be noted that this chapter is now called “Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children.” \nMinor changes/clarifications were made to chapter ENF 21. The changes were made to include reference \nto the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) instead of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency \n(CCRA), the inclusion of exploited children and changes to contact information.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n4 \n1 What this chapter is about  \nThis chapter describes primary and secondary examination procedures intended to assist officers to \nidentify and recover missing and abducted children at the port of entry.  \n2 Program objectives  \nThe protection and recovery of children at risk is part of Citizenship and Immigration Canada’s \ncommitment to:  \n \nensuring and securing the best interest of a child;  \n \nfacilitating family reunification; and \n \nprotecting the health and safety of Canadians and maintaining the security of Canadian society. \n3 The Act and Regulations  \nEvery person seeking to enter Canada must appear for an examination to \ndetermine whether that person has a right to enter Canada or is or may become \nauthorized to enter and remain in Canada.  \nA18(1)  \nA foreign national, other than a protected person, is inadmissible on grounds of \nan inadmissible family member if  \n(a) their accompanying family member or, in prescribed circumstances, \ntheir non-accompanying family member is inadmissible; or \n(b) they are an accompanying family member of an inadmissible person. \nA42  \nIt is affirmed as a principle that a minor child shall be detained only as a \nmeasure of last resort, taking into account the other applicable grounds and \ncriteria including the best interests of the child.  \nA60\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n5 \n3.1 Form  \nThe form required is shown in the following table.  \nForm title  \nForm number  \nOur Missing Children Recovery Report  \nE-514 (see \nAppendix B)  \n4 Instruments and delegations  \nNil.  \n5 Departmental policy  \nA18(1) requires every person seeking to enter Canada to appear for examination to determine whether \nthat person has a right to enter Canada or is or may become authorized to enter and remain in Canada  \n6 Definitions  \nAbduction  \nThe unlawful removal or taking of a person against their will or, in the \ncase of children, against the will of their parent or legal guardian and by \nuse of force or deceit  \nCPIC  \nCanadian Police Information Centre  \nCustody order  \nAn order of custody issued by a court  \nE-514  \nOur Missing Children Recovery Report used by both CIC and CCRA  \nGuardian  \nIncludes any person who has, in law or in fact, the custody or control of \nanother person  \nICES: Integrated Customs \nEnforcement System  \nA CCRA computer database that includes up to date information on \nabducted/missing children cases  \nIndicators  \nDescriptions of general situational, behavioural and sometimes physical \ncharacteristics (for example, tattoos) used by enforcement agencies to \nassist in identifying persons likely to engage in a particular type of illegal \nactivity\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n6 \nMissing child  \nAny person under 18 years of age whose whereabouts are unknown to \ntheir legal guardian and where the circumstances surrounding the \ndisappearance suggest the child was removed without the guardian’s \nconsent, or the child's safety is at risk  \nPALS: Primary Automated \nLookout System  \nA CCRA computer database that includes up to date information on \nabducted/missing children  \nParental/familial abductions  Children who are taken from their legal custodian by a parent or family \nmember without consent or in violation of a custody agreement  \nPIRS: Police Information \nRetrieval System  \nA database governed by the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police \nand operated by the RCMP [Customs and immigration personnel can \naccess data on seizures (made by both CCRA and the RCMP), \nintelligence files and information pertinent to current narcotics activity]  \nRecovery  \nA confirmed case of child abduction or a runaway (whether or not it was \nreported as such to a competent authority) that has been brought to a \nresolution through the intervention of one or more of the five agencies \ninvolved in the Our Missing Children program  \nRestriction order  \nAn order issued by a court, restricting travel beyond a specified area \n(city/town, province/state or country)  \nRunaways  \nChildren who leave home voluntarily without the knowledge or \npermission of the parent or guardian (some provinces may only record \nrunaway children that are 16 years of age or older as missing persons)  \nStranger abductions  \nChildren that are taken by a person who is not their parent or legal \nguardian and without the knowledge or against the wishes of the parent \nor legal guardian  \nThrowaways  \nChildren whose whereabouts are both unknown and unsought by the \nparents or guardians and who are unable to return to the family home \ndue to mostly irresolvable issues within the family (Throwaways are not \nstatistically captured as part of the Our Missing Children program.)\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n7 \n7 Our Missing Children (OMC) Program  \n7.1 Getting assistance from Our Missing Children (OMC) Program  \nCIC is one of five Government of Canada organizations working together to locate missing and abducted \nchildren and return them to their proper guardians. The other members of this successful partnership are \nCanada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Department of \nForeign Affairs and International Trade and the Department of Justice. Together, these departments form \na national clearinghouse, assisting one another, as well as police and other agencies in 40 countries, to \nreunite children with their families.  \nSince the OMC program began in 1986, over 4,000 missing children have been found. Customs and \nimmigration officers alone have reunited 1,083 children with their parents or legal guardians. In 2001, 93 \nchildren were recovered at our borders. Customs and immigration officers must be fully alert to children \nwho need protection and should pay extra attention to children as they enter Canada. A child or youth \ntravelling without proper identification, or in the company of adults other than their legal guardian(s), may \nrequire careful examination. This additional scrutiny is for the sole purpose of ensuring the safety of the \nchild.  \nFor any OMC-related questions, officers can be directed to the contacts. \n7.2 Our Missing Children Recovery Report (Form E-514)  \nFollowing the interception of any abducted or runaway child, officers are required to complete an Our \nMissing Children Recovery Report (E-514) and forward it to the regional OMC coordinator. For detailed \ninstructions on the correct way to complete this form, see Appendix B.  \nThe OMC Recovery Report is a form jointly issued and used by CCRA and CIC to record enforcement \nactions involving the recovery of abducted or runaway children. Correct and uniform completion of the \nreport ensures the accuracy of compiled abductor and victim indicators and assists in identifying \nemerging trends. Incomplete forms will be returned to their originators for completion.  \nForm E-514 is completed only by the recovering department. One copy is retained at the POE and the \noriginal is forwarded to the regional OMC coordinator, who also retains a copy before sending the original \nto their respective national coordinator.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n8 \n7.3 Completing form E-514 for intelligence purposes  \nThe form may also be completed, in exceptional circumstances, where no actual recovery has taken \nplace, for example, where examination of a case suggests a potential abduction, but computer checks \nand other investigation produce negative results. Detailed information regarding the circumstances of \nsuch a case may be of use at a later date. Officers should clearly identify that the information is for \nintelligence purposes only.  \n8 Procedure: Persons with the right to come into Canada  \nOnce an officer is satisfied that an adult or a child is a Canadian citizen, registered Indian or permanent \nresident, the examination should end and the person be allowed into Canada without further delay.  \nOnce the right to enter Canada is established, there is no authority for CIC officers to question a person in \ndetail with respect to a possible missing or abducted child. Officers should be aware that any \nsupplementary information gathered which does not relate to immigration requirements for entry to \nCanada may not be admissible as evidence should prosecution result.  \nWhere there is a suspicion of abduction, the welfare of the child remains paramount and an officer should \nimmediately contact the appropriate law enforcement agency. An officer who has concerns about a child’s \nwelfare but no evidence or information to confirm their suspicions should make a referral to customs \nsecondary examination. Customs inspectors have authority to examine and detain persons seeking entry \nto Canada for specific offences under the Criminal Code, including abduction.  \nOfficers have greater authority to examine foreign nationals who must establish that they are not \ninadmissible to Canada. The possibility that a child is missing or abducted or that the adults travelling with \na child may be abductors is directly relevant to admissibility and an officer is entitled to ask questions \nrelating to the security and well-being of the child. Foreign nationals may therefore be questioned in detail \nin relation to the OMC mandate.  \nAuthority to examine \nThe situation \nWhat to do \nThe child is a foreign national and the \nadult is also a foreign national  \nOfficer has the authority to question both parties.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n9 \nThe child is a foreign national and the \nadult is either a Canadian citizen or \nPermanent Resident  \nOfficer has the authority to question the child; the \nresponsible law enforcement agency would have to question \nthe adult if prosecution is contemplated.  \nThe child is a foreign national travelling \nby themselves  \nOfficer has the authority to question the child.  \nThe child is a Canadian citizen or a \nPermanent Resident and so is the adult  \nOfficer should initiate pre-arranged local procedures with \nCCRA and contact the responsible law enforcement agency.  \nThe child is a Canadian citizen or a \nPermanent Resident and the adult is a \nforeign national  \nOfficer has the authority to question the adult.  \nThe child is a Canadian citizen or a \nPermanent Resident travelling by \nthemselves  \nOfficer should initiate pre-arranged local procedures with \nCCRA and contact the responsible law enforcement agency.  \n9 Procedure: Primary examination of persons travelling with \nchildren  \n9.1 Mandatory PIL referrals of children  \nThe Immigration Secondary Referral List provides that foreign national children, accompanied or alone, \nwho incite concern about the purpose of their trip to Canada or their welfare in Canada are to be referred \nfor an immigration secondary examination. The fact that one adult is travelling alone with a child should \nnot in itself warrant a referral to a secondary examination. If it appears, after a preliminary interview, that \nthe traveller(s) exhibit certain indicators or if there are other grounds for concern, the customs inspector \nwill refer them for a secondary examination.  \nCanadians and those persons who have the right to enter Canada are examined under the identical \ncriteria and are referred to a customs secondary examination when concerns about child security arise.  \n9.2 Line of questioning at PIL  \nCustoms inspectors at the primary inspection line usually begin each examination by asking travellers to \nstate their citizenship. Foreign nationals are queried about their destination, duration and purpose of \ntravel.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n10 \nPIL officers may then ask an adult under examination to state their relationship to any accompanying \nchildren. They may ask if they have proof of the relationship and, if only one parent is present, if they \nhave permission from the absent parent to travel with the child. If the adults are not the parents, they will \nbe asked if they have a note or permission from the parents. Officers may also ask each child a few \nquestions. The officer may then ask to see identity documents, including proof of citizenship and \nrelationship to the child.  \n9.3 Where consent/documentation not required  \nOfficers should be aware that a letter of permission from an absent parent is not required where either of \nthe following documents are presented: a birth certificate listing the father as ‘unknown’ or custody papers \nindicating that the travelling parent has sole custody.  \nCanadian and American citizens are not required by law to carry identification when travelling into \nCanada. They can be authorized to enter Canada as long as the officer is satisfied of their citizenship. \nConsequently, parents without identification for their children should not automatically be referred to a \nsecondary examination simply for that reason.  \n10 Procedure: Outcomes at PIL  \n10.1 Persons with a right to come into Canada  \nIf satisfied that all persons in the group have the right to enter Canada, the officer will authorize entry to \nCanada and may provide a handout on the OMC program.  \nIf concerns about child security exist, a referral to a Customs secondary examination will be made.  \nIf an officer is not satisfied that all persons in the group have the right to enter Canada, a referral for an \nimmigration secondary examination will be made.  \n10.2 Persons making an application to come into Canada  \n \nIf satisfied of both admissibility and child security issues, a PIL officer will authorize entry and may \nprovide a handout on the OMC program.  \n \nIf not satisfied of the admissibility or the security of a child, the officer will refer to an immigration \nsecondary examination.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n11 \nNote: To alert the secondary officer, PIL officers are expected to code the E-67 or E-311 referral form with \n“OMC” for “Our Missing Children”. The secondary officer then contacts the PIL officer for details of the \nindicators that resulted in the referral. The use of non-secure communications such as a radio \ntransmission should be avoided to protect the client’s privacy. No member of the public should be made \naware of a potential child abduction case. Officers should only use radio communications in an \nemergency situation where the relay of information is time sensitive or the child's safety is in jeopardy.  \n11 Procedure: Abduction indicators  \nThe following list of possible abduction indicators assists PIL customs inspectors in deciding whether to \nrefer travellers with children for a secondary examination. While every missing child case is unique, the \nmajority of referrals that result in the recovery of a child exhibit several of these indicators.  \nType of indicator  \nDetails  \nGeneral indicators  \n \nDisplay of unwarranted hostility to being questioned; \n \nResponding to questions with obviously prepared answers; \n \nHesitation if asked unexpected questions; \n \nAttempts by the adult to answer for or block questioning of the \nchild; \n \nUnwillingness to produce documents; \n \nSuspicious or inappropriate documentation; \n \nUnwillingness of any person in the group to make eye contact; \n \nUndue hesitation by children in responding to questioning and \noverreaction by adults to their answers; \n \nTravelling on a school day; \n \nPhysical appearance of a child such as clothing, hairstyle or \nmakeup that might indicate an attempt to alter appearance; \n \nSigns of physical abuse such as bruising, poor hygiene or mal- \nnourishment; \n \nNervousness or fear on the part of a child; \n \nInappropriate reason for travel considering the age of a child; \n \nVague reasons for the absence of one or both parents.  \nIndicators at land border \ncrossings  \n \nChildren squeezed between adults or appear to be physically \ncontrolled;\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n12 \n \nAmount of clothing inappropriate for length or purpose of trip; \n \nQuantity and condition of a child’s toys inconsistent with the stated \npurpose and duration of the trip and the age of the child; \n \nPresence of child pornography in vehicle; \n \nAppearance of feigned sleep by minor passengers; \n \nInappropriate time for crossing border with a child in conjunction \nwith other factors. \nIndicators at airports  \n \nAdult passenger with baby but no diaper bag or toys; \n \nMinimal luggage;  \n \nDiscrepancies between duration of trip and quantity of luggage \ncarried;  \n \nRecently purchased ticket or different purchase dates for adult and \nchild’s ticket; \n \nIllogical trip routing. \nFor more information on missing child indicators, see Appendix A.  \n12 Procedure: Secondary examination of persons travelling with \nchildren  \n12.1 Examining persons with a right to come into Canada  \nCustoms inspectors may conduct secondary examinations of persons whose right to enter Canada has \nbeen established. When the security of a child is brought into question by OMC coding on the PIL referral \nform (E-67 or E-311), the customs secondary officer may examine both adults and minors to determine if \nabduction of a child is a possibility.  \nThe customs inspector will confirm the number of persons in the vehicle or travelling party, and will \nrequest identification for both adults and children. Customs inspectors may ask additional questions \nconcerning travel plans, the adult/child relationship and the location and consent of any absent parent to \nthe travel plan. They also have the authority to conduct CPIC, ICES and PIRS checks on both adult and \nchild. If the travelling parent agrees, an officer may call the absent parent. Customs inspectors are well \nversed in the provisions of the Privacy Act and their obligation to refrain from revealing information about \nthe person under examination when seeking telephone confirmation.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n13 \nBased on the answers provided and the results of computer checks, the customs inspector will either be \nsatisfied of the bona fides of the situation and authorize entry or will investigate further. If authorized to \nenter, parents or guardians are given a handout on the OMC program.  \n12.2 Examining persons making an application to come into Canada  \nAt most ports of entry, officers conduct secondary examination of foreign nationals making an application \nto enter Canada. When presented with a secondary referral form coded OMC, the officer should \nimmediately and discreetly contact the PIL officer for information on the indicators that resulted in referral.  \nExamination then follows a similar format to that described above for a customs secondary examination. \nThe officer:  \n \nconfirms the number of travellers; \n \nrequests identification for each adult and child; \n \ndetermines the usual place of residence, purpose and intended duration of the visit to Canada; \nand \n \nverifies the adult/child relationship and the security of the child. \nIn addition to examining the adults, the officer may wish to question the child, conduct checks using \nFOSS, CPIC, NCIC and Interpol, or confirm the information provided at examination by contacting the \nabsent parent(s) by telephone.  \n12.3 CPIC check  \nCanada Immigration Centres across Canada have access to the Canadian Police Information Centre \n(CPIC) either directly or through local law enforcement partnerships. The CPIC Reference Manual \ncontains information on the use of CPIC in relation to missing children. In cases of possible child \nabduction or runaway, the officer should always check CPIC as it is kept up to date with all of the children \nreported to the National Missing Children Services from enforcement agencies. FOSS is not as reliable in \nthis respect.  \nAn additional resource which officers may choose to access is Canadian Centre for Child Protection’s \nMissing Kids.ca. This online database lists missing children from Canada. While not exhaustive, this \ndatabase contains a large listing of missing children, most with photos. While not a substitute for the \nauthoritative information contained on CPIC and NCIC, this site may assist the examination process, \nparticularly if usual sources are not available.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n14 \n12.4 Confirming information by telephone  \nTelephone verification can be a quick and effective way to establish that the absent parent(s) have \nknowledge of their child’s location. The officer may find the OMC handout a useful tool in gaining the \ncompliance of the accompanying adult when conducting this check.  \nOfficers should ensure the privacy of the persons under examination while conducting a telephone check. \nWhen contact is made with an absent parent, officers should clearly identify themselves, their location \nand the name of the child making application to enter Canada. They should confirm that they are \nspeaking to a parent or guardian of the child concerned, then briefly explain CIC’s role in the OMC \nprogram before verifying that the child is known to be travelling with the accompanying parent or other \nadult. No further information about the persons under examination should be communicated beyond what \nis absolutely necessary to confirm the security of the child.  \nBased on the information gathered through these examination techniques and the results of computer \nchecks, the officer will authorize entry if satisfied as to the security of the child or will investigate further.  \n13 Procedure: Examining children  \nThe questioning of travellers on adult-child relationships requires tact and diplomacy. To prevent an \naccompanying adult from taking offence to the questioning of a child, it is important for an officer to clearly \nexplain the reasons for this procedure. Providing a copy of the OMC handout may assist in diffusing \ntension in this situation.  \nWhen questioning a child directly, officers must also take care to adopt a less formal line of questioning in \norder to avoid frightening or intimidating the child.  \n13.1 Separating an adult and child for questioning  \nUnder normal circumstances, a child should not be separated from an adult, particularly a parent, during \nexamination. The majority of referrals to a secondary examination due to concerns for a child’s security \nprove to be legitimate relationships. After questioning the adults of the party and conducting database \nchecks, the officer can usually be satisfied that the situation is bona fide.  \nWhere an officer is not satisfied and efforts to contact the absent parents are unsuccessful, the officer \nmay wish to question the child separately. This may be done only if, and for as long as, the child appears \nto be comfortable with the situation. The adult must be informed of the purpose of this procedure (to verify \nthe reported purpose of the trip, relationship, etc.) and the child should then be interviewed within the\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n15 \neyesight but out of hearing range of the adult. If circumstances require that a child be interviewed out of \nsight of the adult, a second officer should also be present throughout the interview. A child should never \nbe forced to accompany an officer out of sight of the adult.  \n13.2 Guidelines for interviewing children  \n \nWhere possible, a male child should be interviewed by a male officer and a female child by a \nfemale officer. The presence of a toy or stuffed animal may be a reassuring presence to a child in \nthis circumstance. \n \nThe officer must take care to use plain language, to adopt a relaxed, non-threatening posture and \ntone of voice and to make eye contact when speaking. \n \nEnsuring that the child understands what has been said can be accomplished with the use of \nperception checking techniques. An example of this is to ask the child to explain, in their own \nwords, what has been explained to them. \n \nOfficers must bear in mind that some children may be shy, embarrassed or simply unfamiliar with \nabduction terminology. Other children may have a fear of authority figures. A child who has been \nabducted may be highly traumatized and unable to coherently explain the situation, while other \nchildren may not even be aware that they have been abducted. Attentive observation of body \nlanguage and careful listening are valuable skills in determining which children are at risk. \n \nThe interview should be concluded in a positive and supportive manner. An explanation of why \nthe questions were asked should be provided on a level equal to the child’s age and ability to \nunderstand. \n13.3 Line of questioning for children  \nQuestions for children must be kept as simple as possible. Initial questions should be targeted at:  \n \nconfirming the child’s name, age and usual place of residence; \n \nestablishing the child’s knowledge of the relationship to the person with whom they are travelling, \ntheir intended destination and the duration of the trip; \n \nestablishing the usual domestic or custody arrangement, the absent parents’ knowledge of and \nconsent to the travel plan, their current location and phone number. \n14 Procedure: Guidelines in the case of a confirmed abduction  \nWhere a secondary immigration examination confirms concerns about the security of a child, further \nimmediate action is required. The steps to be taken in the event of an interception of a missing child\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n16 \ndepend upon the situation. Abduction cases and runaways are not handled in the same manner. Whether \npersons concerned have a right to enter Canada is also an important factor. It must be stressed that \nthese are guidelines only. Each circumstance is unique and procedures will vary from region to region.  \n14.1 Protecting the well-being of the child  \nThe first priority in a case of confirmed abduction must be to secure the safety of the child. The following \nguidelines may assist officers in successfully managing these emotionally charged situations with the \nleast amount of trauma to the child concerned.  \n \nWhere practical, the child should be removed from the physical control of the suspected abductor. \nOfficers must recognize that the child may be anxious or may become anxious at the prospect of \nbeing separated from the accompanying adult, especially if the adult is a parent. If necessary for \nthe child’s peace of mind, secure the adult and child together. \n \nWhile demonstrating both concern and compassion, an officer can reassure the child that they \nare safe. Where possible, the child should be provided with comfortable surroundings away from \nthe eyes of the public. They should not be discouraged from expressing their feelings. Should the \narrest of an accompanying parent become necessary, the child should be protected from \nwitnessing this procedure. \n \nOfficers should answer the child’s questions as simply and truthfully as possible, ensuring that \ntheir remarks do not reflect prejudice, cynicism, over-reaction or zealousness.  \n \nIf the child is turned over to a police officer, social worker or other agency, the officer should be \npresent to make the introduction and provide additional reassurance by explaining who the \nperson is and why the child must go with that person. \n14.2 Detention of children  \nA60 stipulates that a minor child shall be detained only as a measure of last resort, taking into account \nthe other applicable grounds and criteria including the best interests of the child. (For detailed information \non the factors that must be taken into account for the detention of minor children under 18 years of age, \nsee ENF 20, section 5.10.  \n14.3 Persons with a right to enter Canada  \nAn immigration secondary examination may result in the identification of an abductor who is a Canadian \ncitizen, permanent resident or registered Indian. In this circumstance, the officer must immediately contact \nthe local police agency, clearly communicating that a particularly quick response is necessary since CIC \nis unable to detain or unreasonably impede those with a right to enter Canada. The officer should not\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n17 \ncontinue questioning once the offence has been discovered but should keep factual notes of the event by \nrecording statements, times, observations and other relevant information.  \nThe adult should be advised that the police have been notified. Where an alleged abductor with a right to \ncome into Canada refuses to await the arrival of police officials, customs inspectors may assist by \nexercising their authority to detain or arrest anyone suspected of having committed or who is in the \nprocess of committing a Criminal Code offence.  \n14.4 Foreign nationals  \nIn all cases where the abductor does not have the right to enter Canada, an A44(1) report must be \ncompleted under the appropriate section of the Act or Regulations. In the case of familial abduction, the \nchild should be reported A(42) as an inadmissible family member.  \nOfficers must then assess the child’s individual circumstances. In cases of familial abduction, it may be \nappropriate to secure and/or transport the child with the parent where facilities allow. Where separation of \nthe child from the abductor is necessary, the local child protection agency may be contacted to take \ncustody of the child.  \n14.5 U.S. citizens and resident aliens  \n \nWhere the alleged abductor is a U.S. citizen or resident seeking entry to Canada or encountered \ninland, an officer must contact the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (USINS). \nCIC officers are required to alert them to the confirmed abduction, the facts known and the time \nwhen the adult and child will be returned. If the USINS is unable to confirm that they have the \nauthority to hold the persons for the police, the officer then contacts the nearest U.S. police \ndepartment directly for assistance. The parties to a confirmed abduction case must never be \nreturned to the United States without confirmation that U.S. authorities will be on site to take \nappropriate action. \nOnce reception arrangements have been made, a decision can be reached, on a case by case basis, as \nto arrangements for returning the subjects to the United States. The overriding factor in every situation is \nthe safety of the child.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n18 \n14.6 Other foreign nationals  \nWhere the abduction involves persons other than those with a right to enter Canada or U.S. citizens or \nresidents, an officer can utilize the following resources to alert the family of the missing child to their \nrecovery and to initiate arrangements for their repatriation:  \n \nthe Missing Children Registry can request an Interpol check, however, officers should be aware \nthat results are sometimes not received for one or more days; \n \nthe consulate of the country of the child's nationality can provide information and assistance; \n \nthe municipal police of the child’s country of nationality may assist in establishing contact with the \nfamily to advise of the recovery; \n \nthe Provincial Central Authority for the Hague Convention can also assist in the quick return of \nthe abducted child. \nNote: Only as a last resort should officers contact the person who has legal custody of the child. \nExperience has shown that it is preferable to have local police establish contact with the family abroad as \ntheir presence lends credibility to the news of the recovery and can also help to prevent \nmiscommunication.  \nWhen arrangements are being made for the return of a child, the receiving country's immigration or law \nenforcement agency should also be notified. They may be able to provide assistance that will ensure safe \nand straightforward repatriation, transfer of the child to lawful custody (if this has not already occurred) \nand follow up action on the abductor, where necessary. This notification is made through the OMC office \nat RCMP headquarters.  \n15 Procedure: Guidelines for runaways  \nAn officer who encounters a runaway must advise the police agency that has jurisdiction over the \nrunaway of their interception at the border point. The police agency will then provide direction. Legislation \nregarding runaways differs between provinces and states. Some jurisdictions will simply cancel the \nmissing person report once it is known that the subject is alive and is not a victim of foul play.  \nWhile it is not a criminal offence to be a runaway, CIC officers have an obligation to consider the safety \nand protection of the child. Therefore, officers must contact either a local police or youth protective \nservice agency whenever a runaway who is under 15 years of age is detected.  \nA runaway 15 years or older is free to go if an officer has confirmed that they have a right to enter \nCanada and that the originating police agency requires no further action on the case.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n19 \nFor runaways who do not have a right to enter Canada, the procedure is identical, with the exception that \nadmissibility must be addressed and immigration enforcement action taken where appropriate.  \nIf a runaway expresses a wish to return home but the responsible police agency indicates that it will not \nprovide transport, the following social service agencies may be contacted to provide assistance:  \n \nChildren's Aid Society; \n \nOperation Go Home; \n \nlocal shelters; \n \nYMCA; \n \nyouth protection agencies. \nIn all cases where a runaway is intercepted, the officer completes an OMC Recovery Report and forwards \nit to the regional OMC coordinator.  \n16 Procedure: Border alerts - Lookout procedures for missing \nchildren  \nBorder alerts or “lookouts” are only issued at the request of law enforcement agencies. Where a request \nis received from parents, non-profit organizations, private investigations firms, lawyers or other \nindividuals, they should be referred to their local police force.  \nLookouts must contain the following information:  \n \na contact name and number at the requesting police agency, in the event of a recovery; \n \nthe name of the CIC officer issuing the lookout; \n \na brief description of the situation and the reasons the lookout has been requested. \nLookouts are entered into FOSS and are also input, by CCRA staff, into ICES, PALS and PIRS. Requests \nfor lookouts concerning potential minor abduction cases must be referred to the OMC National \nCoordinator. These lookouts will not be issued regionally/locally.  \nAll ports of entry are required to notify their regional OMC coordinator in the event of any lookout being \nissued for a minor. The regional coordinator will pass the information to the national office. Local POEs \nare permitted to issue lookouts to their opposing U.S. Customs/USINS partners regarding minors not \nbelieved to be victims of abduction, provided they give notification to their regional coordinator. All \nnational cross border alerts will be issued from the national OMC office.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n20 \n17 Procedure: Counselling the public  \nAn important part of an officer’s job at the port of entry is to provide clear and accurate information to help \ntravellers adequately prepare for immigration examination. Often this counselling takes place during an \nexamination, when travellers experience more difficulty than they had anticipated in meeting the \nrequirements of the Act for entry to Canada. It also frequently occurs that travellers will contact the POE \nbefore they depart to determine exact requirements. Wherever possible, officers should provide a copy of \nthe handout “Tips for Canadians Crossing the Border”.  \nThe following table lists the type of information that an officer may have to provide to travellers.  \nTopic for counselling  \nDetails  \nIdentification for children  Parents should be advised that the best type of identification for a child is a \npassport or birth certificate and that if they travel without these documents it \nwill be at the examining officers' discretion as to whether or not they will be \nadmitted. Officers should also indicate that, under normal circumstances, \nfailure to produce these documents would not prevent their entry to Canada.  \nProof of relationship  \nIn addition to identification, parents and guardians should be counselled to \ncarry proof of their relationship to the child. For parents, the best proof is a \nbirth certificate that identifies one or both of the parents. The parent’s \nidentification should then correspond to the child's name. Proof of adoption, \nwhere relevant, should also be carried. When travelling in several vehicles, \nparents and their children should be advised to arrive at the border in the \nsame vehicle.  \nCustody orders  \nWhere a parent has obtained an order legally establishing custody of the \nchild, it must be carried as proof. Officers should note that there could be \ndifferent custody orders held by each parent. Custody orders can be issued \nby a variety of jurisdictions (province, state or county) and in some situations \nthese orders can overlap.  \nConsent for children \ntravelling without their \nlegal guardian  \nAdults travelling with children for whom they are not the legal guardians \nshould be advised to carry a letter from the parent(s) or guardian(s) that \ncontains the following information:  \n \nname and address of parent/guardian;  \n \ntelephone numbers at work/home;\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n21 \n \nthe destination in Canada;  \n \nthe period of time the child will be in Canada;  \n \nexplicit authorization by the legal guardian for the child to travel with \nthe named adult and to enter Canada.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n22 \nAppendix A Missing children indicators  \n1. Parental abduction  \nA parental abduction occurs when a child under 14 is taken by a parent or guardian without permission or \nlegal authority from the parent or guardian with lawful custody of the child. This applies whether or not \nthere is a formal custody order. (See sections 282 and 283 of the Criminal Code.)  \nThe parents of an abducted child may be separated, divorced or unwed. Abductors may be joint custodial \nor non-custodial parents. One parent may abduct a child in order to deprive the other parent of his or her \nrights, possibly with the hope of obtaining custody in another province or country.  \nMany people believe that a child abducted by a parent is not at risk, however, the effect of uprooting a \nchild from their home, school and community can have lasting detrimental effects on children already \ndistressed by the break-up of the family home. Further trauma may result if they are led to believe that the \nabsent parent is dead or has abandoned them. For all of these reasons, victims of parental abduction are \nchildren at risk.  \nStatistics over a ten-year period show that, in Canada, an average of 400 cases of parental abduction are \nreported to police each year.  \nGeneral characteristics of parental abductors and their victims  \n \nMale and female non-custodial parents are equally likely to abduct their own child. Male and \nfemale children are equally likely to be abducted. \n \nAbductor characteristics transcend ethnic, economic and social boundaries. \n \nThe majority of parents who abduct their children are between 28 and 40 years of age. The \nchildren they abduct usually range from infant to eight years of age, with the majority falling in the \nrange of three to seven years of age. \n \nParental abductors frequently act alone. When an accomplice is used, they are often a relative or \nthe abductor’s partner.  \n \nThe majority of recoveries involve trans-border vehicle transportation and commercial air \ntransportation, though other modes of transportation can and have been used. \n \nSome communication usually occurs between the searching parent and the abductor.  \n \nThe majority of parental abductions are short-term and are resolved within seven days.  \n \nChildren are most frequently abducted during weekends or summer/winter holiday visits.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n23 \n1.1 Stranger abductions (non-parental abductions)  \nIn non-parental abductions, the child is taken by someone other than a parent, guardian or person with \nlawful care or charge of the child. This can be a stranger, a relative, a non-related person known to the \nchild or a person not yet identified. Canadian statistics show that very few non-parental abductions are \ncommitted by true strangers. Most of the abductors are relatives, friends or acquaintances. Similar to U.S. \nstatistics, stranger abductions (which are uncommon in Canada) often involve sexual assault or homicide.  \nMissing children statistics in 1999 show that females accounted for 65% of children abducted by a \nstranger. Canadian data corresponds closely to studies in the United States, which show that half of the \nvictims abducted by non-family members are 12 years or older and three-quarters of the victims are \nfemale.  \nAccording to CPIC data, an average of 60 children in Canada were abducted by strangers each year \nbetween 1990 and 1999. This represents less than 0.1% of the average 62,000 children registered as \nmissing on CPIC during each of those same years. Many non-parental abductions take place on weekday \nafternoons.  \n1.2 Runaways  \nRunaways are children who voluntarily leave their homes. In Canada, over three-quarters of all missing \nchildren cases reported to police are “runaways”. According to CPIC data, between 1990 and 1999, an \naverage of 44,000 children ran away each year. More female runaways are typically reported to police \nthan males. Over 17% of runaways are age 12 to 13 years and roughly half are between the ages of 14 \nand 15.  \nWhile many children run away to assert their independence, studies show that an overwhelming number \nof children run away to escape from painful family conflict or from physical, psychological or sexual \nabuse.  \nThe majority of runaways return home after a brief absence but others become repeat or chronic \nrunaways. Life on the street or on the run for these children can be extremely dangerous and harmful. \nThe longer they are on the street, the greater their chances of becoming entrenched in street life and \nfalling victim to the exploitation of criminal elements.\nENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children \n2017-08-25 \n \n24 \nAppendix B Form E-514, Our missing children recovery report  \nCompletion instructions  \n1.  \nIndicate the FOSS identification number, if applicable.  \n2.  \nIndicate the CPIC number, if applicable.  \n3.  \nIndicate the ICES number, if applicable.  \n4.  \nIndicate the DFAIT (Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade) number, if applicable.  \n5.  \nReport Number use the normal sequence of numbers established in your region for this \npurpose.  \n6.  \nIndicate the region of the port of entry.  \n7.  \nIndicate the country where the interception took place.  \n8.  \nIndicate office name (city, town village, port name).  \n9.  \nShow the date in this order: year / month / day.  \n10.  \nA Incident Type Place a check in the applicable box: Parental Abduction, Stranger Abduction \nor Runaway.  \n11.  \nB Intercepted By When a missing child has been intercepted, place a check in the applicable \nbox: Lookout, Indicator or Other.
