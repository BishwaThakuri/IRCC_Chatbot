OP 5 contains guidelines for processing applications from refugees abroad. \n2. \nProgram objectives \nThe objective of Canada’s Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program (RHRP) is to uphold \nCanada’s humanitarian tradition as outlined in paragraphs 3(a)(b)(d)(f) of the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Act. \nFour core principles govern the RHRP. These principles place increased emphasis on the \nprotection of refugees and people in “refugee-like” situations by emphasizing: \n \na shift toward protection rather than ability to establish; \n \nfamily reunification;  \n \naccelerated processing of urgent and vulnerable protection cases; and \n \ncloser relationships between CIC and its partners. \n2.1. \nHumanitarian component of the immigration program \nCanada includes a humanitarian component in its immigration program. \nCanada resettles refugees from abroad\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n6 \n \n \nfor humanitarian reasons; \n \nto meet its international responsibilities; and \n \nto respond to international crises by providing protection to and durable solutions for refugees. \nIn 1969, Canada signed both the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees \nand the 1967 Protocol. These international instruments oblige Canada to protect refugees on its \nterritory and provide standards on the treatment of refugees. \nThe Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad classes (HPC) assist persons in “refugee-like” \nsituations where their admission would be in accordance with Canada’s humanitarian tradition. It \nbroadens the Convention refugee definition. \nRefugees who meet Canada's eligibility and admissibility criteria are considered for resettlement \nbecause they are deemed to be at risk, are seeking family reunification, or have met other valid \nconditions. \n3. \nThe Act and Regulations  \nFor information about \nRefer to  \nNotes \nAbility to establish \nR139(1)(g)(i),(ii),(iii),(iv) \n(General requirements) \n \nAnnual report to Parliament \nA94 \n \nApplicants from signatory countries \nA102(a)(b)(c) \nR146 (Humanitarian-protected \npersons abroad)  \n \nConvention refugees \nA96 \n \nConvention refugees abroad class \nR144 and 145 (Convention \nrefugees abroad class and \nMember of convention refugees \nabroad class) \n \nCountry of asylum class \nR146 and 147 (Humanitarian-\nprotected persons abroad and \nMember of asylum class) \n \nCriminal inadmissibility \nA36(1)(a)(b)(c)  \nA36(2)(a)(b)(c)(d) \nA37(1)(a)(b) \nA36(1) applies to serious \ncriminality \nA36(2) applies to criminality \nA37(1) applies to organized \ncriminality \nDocuments: Status document \nA31(1) Status document \nR53(1) Document indicating \nstatus \n \nDocuments required: Permanent residents R50(1) (Documents -\npermanent residents) \nR50(2) (Exception -

In 1969, Canada signed both the 1951 \nGeneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. These international \ninstruments oblige Canada to protect refugees on its territory. Canada has also made a \ncommitment to resettle refugees from abroad for humanitarian reasons.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n4 \n \nCIC has established the Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program that resettles \nConvention refugees (CR) and members of the Country of Asylum (RA) classes included in the \nHumanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad class.  \n5.2. \nImmigration agreements \nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act allows the Minister to enter into agreements with \nprovinces and territories on sharing responsibility for immigration. \nAll provinces and territories meet regularly with federal-provincial working groups to discuss a \nwide range of immigration issues. \nThe provinces and territories that have an agreement with CIC regarding immigration are \nidentified in the information table found at the following website indicated below:   \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/laws-policy/agreements/index.asp  \n5.3. \nCanada-Quebec Accord \nThe Canada-Quebec Accord is the most comprehensive of the provincial agreements. Signed in \n1991, it gives Quebec selection powers and control over its own settlement services. \nCanada retains responsibility for: \n \ndefining immigration categories; \n \nsetting levels;and \n \nenforcement. \nThe Canada-Quebec Accord specifically gives Quebec sole responsibilities for selecting all \nindependent immigrants and refugees abroad who are destined to Quebec. \nThose selected by the province receive a Certificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ).

The statutory requirements \nappear in sections 34 to 38 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n8 \n \n7.2. \nAssistance loan  \nThe assistance loan provides financial assistance to: \n \nforeign nationals,  \n \npermanent residents,  \n \nConvention refugees, and  \n \nmembers of the Humanitarian-protected persons abroad classes  \nto cover the costs associated with the initial settlement of persons granted admission to Canada. \n7.3. \nBlended sponsorship \nA sponsorship undertaking whereby both CIC and a SAH share support for the refugee(s). The \nSAH has responsibility for the reception and settlement assistance for the refugee(s) for the term \nof the sponsorship. The period and extent of financial support that each party contributes is \nestablished with the agreement of both parties. In instances of group processing, a single \nagreement may be reached for all refugees with variations according to region of destination. \n7.4. \nCommon-law relationships \n“Common-law partner” means a person who is cohabiting in a conjugal relationship with another \nperson either of the opposite sex or same sex, having so cohabited for a period of at least one \nyear. \n7.5. \nCommunity Sponsor \nA Community Sponsor may be: \n \nan organization; \n \nan association; or, \n \na corporation.  \nIt is not necessary that the organization, association or corporation be incorporated under \nfederal or provincial law. \n7.6. \nComputer-Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) \nCAIPS is an electronic file system to store, transmit, access, and retrieve immigration processing, \nenforcement, and control information.

For example, a niece who has \nlost both her parents coming to be in the care of her father’s sister, who already resides in \nCanada.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n9 \n \n7.8. \nCo-Sponsor \nA sponsoring group may choose to formally partner with an individual (e.g., a family member of \nthe sponsored refugee living in Canada) and/or another organization in carrying out settlement \nduties. The partner is termed a “co-sponsor.” \n7.9. \nConstituent Group  \nConstituent Groups (CGs) are local groups that are associated with a Sponsorship Agreement \nHolder (SAH) to sponsor refugees under the SAH’s agreement. Each SAH sets its own criteria for \nrecognizing CGs. \nCGs have the following characteristics: \n \nthey are in the community where the refugee(s) is/are destined; \n \nthey are authorized, in writing, by the SAH to act on its behalf as sponsors of refugees; and \n \nthey are managed under the umbrella of the SAH’s agreement with CIC. \n7.10. \nContribution program  \nCertain categories of refugees selected abroad (e.g. single parents of large refugee families, \nvictims of torture, refugees with disabilities) who apply for an immigration loan may have access to \nthe contribution fund from the RAP. This fund will pay, on a contribution basis, for transportation, \nmedical examination, and costs associated with travel to the final destination in Canada, for \nselected special needs refugees. \n7.11. \nConvention refugee \nThe definition of a Convention refugee is based on that contained in the 1951 Geneva Convention \nand its 1967 Protocol.  \nA96(a) and (b) define a Convention refugee as follows: \nA Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for \nreasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political \nopinion,  \n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, \nunwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or \n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual \nresidence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country. \nNote: See A98 for persons who are excluded from being a Convention refugee. \n7.12. \nConvention Refugees Abroad class (CR) \nR144 and R145 define the “Convention Refugees Abroad class.” To be eligible for resettlement in \nCanada, a person must: \n \nmeet the Convention refugee definition; \n \napply for protection from outside Canada; and \n \nnot have, within a reasonable period of time, a durable solution other than resettlement in \nCanada.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n10 \n \nIndividuals may be government assisted, privately sponsored or have adequate financial means to \nsupport themselves and their dependants. \n7.13. \nCountry of Asylum class  \nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations define members of the Country of Asylum \nclass (RA) as persons: \n \nwho have been and continue to be seriously and personally affected by civil war, armed \nconflict or massive violations of human rights; and \n \nfor whom there is no possibility, within a reasonable period of time, of a durable solution other \nthan resettlement in Canada. \nIndividuals selected under this category must be outside all of their countries of citizenship or \nhabitual residence. They may be privately sponsored (RAS/RAG/RAC), have adequate financial \nmeans to support themselves and their dependants (RA4), or have qualified for a Joint Assistance \nSponsorship (RA5). \nNote: “Seriously and personally affected” means sustained, effective denial of a core or basic human right. \n7.14. \nDe facto dependants \nDe facto dependants (who may or may not be blood relatives) do not meet the definition of family \nmembers. The officer must be satisfied that these persons are dependent on the family unit in \nwhich membership is claimed and cannot apply as a family member. The dependency may be \nemotional or economic and will often be a combination of these factors. Such persons would \nnormally, but not exclusively, reside with the Principal Applicant (PA) as members of the same \nhousehold. They must be the dependants of a PA who has been determined to be a member of \none of the three refugee classes. The de facto dependant  must also meet the definition of \nrefugee in his own right even when a dependency relationship is established. Persons who form \npart of the family unit should be examined sympathetically. This is consistent with efforts to keep \nfamily units together if at all possible. If the de facto relationship cannot be established, then the \nrefugee must be assessed in his/her own right as a refugee and, failing that, could be considered \nunder H&C grounds. \nExamples of persons who should be found to be “de facto” dependants: \n \nAn unmarried adult daughter in cultures where it is normal for an unmarried adult daughter to \nremain dependent until she marries. \n \nA widowed sister or sister-in-law in a traditional culture where it is normal that the PA take on \nresponsibility for her care and support where she has no other means of support. \n \nNieces and nephews whose parents have been killed or are missing. In the cases of nieces \nand nephews, officers must take into consideration the best interests of the child and ensure \nthat there are no disputes with respect to custody or guardianship of the child. \n \nParents of any age living with the PA and who have no other children with whom they could \nreside or no means of support other than the principal applicant.  \n \nElderly relatives who have resided with the PA and/or who are solely, or for the most part, \ndependent on the applicant for care, shelter, etc. \nExamples of persons who should NOT be found to be “de facto” dependants\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n11 \n \n \nA married sister living with the PA who has a husband residing in another known location, \nunless it is demonstrated to the officer that the sister cannot rely upon her husband for \nsupport. \n \nA married daughter and her husband living with the PA unless they can demonstrate to the \nofficer that they are completely dependent upon the principal applicant for financial support .  \n \nAn elderly parent who normally resides with the PA but who may reside with other children \nfrom time to time. \n \nA person who has been taking care of the PA’s children and living in the household for an \nextended period of time but who is not without family of their own. \n7.15. \nDestination Matching Request (DMR) \nVisa offices use Destination Matching Requests (DMRs) for all GARs, including visa office-\nreferred (VOR) and JAS cases. \nPlease note that each DMR message sent to the Matching Centre must: \n \nindicate the name of the visa office sending the DMR; \n \nbe numbered sequentially beginning at 001, followed by the year in which the refugees will be \ntravelling (example: NROBI 001/2009);  \n \ncontain no more than 30 people. \nNote that VOR and JAS cases do not need to be numbered sequentially and should be limited to \none family unit. \nFor the format of a DMR, please refer to OP 5, Section 19.1, For the format of a DMR for \nJAS/VOR, please refer to OP 5, Section 17.3.  \n7.16. \nDestining \nDestining is the process whereby CIC sends (destines) refugees to a location within Canada \nwhere community resources and services will best support their resettlement and integration \nneeds. Wherever possible, refugees will be referred to communities in Canada where relatives or \nclose friends have been identified in the CAIPS notes. For more information, refer to Section 8. \n7.17. \nDurable solution \nThe three durable solutions for refugees and persons in “refugee-like” situations are: \n \nVoluntary repatriation or resettlement in their country of nationality or habitual \nresidence: Voluntary repatriation should occur only when the situation in the country of \nhabitual or permanent residence has changed in a lasting and meaningful way and refugees \ncan return in safety and dignity. If the population is made up of many ethnic groups, officers \nshould bear in mind that there are a variety of reasons why some individuals may not be able \nto return safely when others can, including political opinion, religion and personal experience \n(e.g. survivors of torture or rape for whom it would be re-traumatizing to return, or individuals \nwho would be social outcasts like the forced slaves of combatants.). The United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is an excellent source of information on such \nconditions.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n12 \n \n \nIntegration in their country of asylum: Refugees are considered to be locally integrated in \nthe country of refuge if they have rights similar to those of citizens such as: they can move \naround the country freely; they are allowed to earn a living; their children are allowed to attend \nschool; there is no threat of refoulement, etc.  \n \nResettlement to a third country: Resettlement is intended for those refugees without local \nintegration prospects. Resettlement may also be used as an instrument of protection geared \nprimarily to the special needs of refugees whose life, liberty, safety, health or fundamental \nhuman rights are at risk in the country where they sought refuge. It is used for refugees \nunable to benefit from the other two solutions.  \nThere is a fourth type of durable solution - internal flight alternative (IFA) - that may exist for \nrefugees and persons in refugee-like situations who have not fled their country of nationality. IFA \ninvolves consideration of whether the individual could have found a safe haven in another location \nwithin the country of nationality or residence at the time of their flight. If so, they will not need \nCanada’s protection. \nNote: The fear of being persecuted need not always extend to the whole territory of the refugees’ \ncountry of nationality. For example, in ethnic clashes or civil war, persecution of a specific ethnic or \nnational group may occur only in one part to the country. However, individuals will not be excluded \nfrom refugee status merely because they could have sought refuge in another part of the same \ncountry, if under the circumstances, it is not reasonable to expect them to do so. \n7.18. \nEligibility \nTo be eligible for resettlement, three conditions must be met: \nThe applicant(s) must:  \n1 - meet the definition of one of the following: \n \nConvention Refugees Abroad class (CR); \n \nHumanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad class (HPC) which includes: \n Country of Asylum class (RA) \n2 - not have any other durable solution (see definition in Section 7.17); and \n3 - demonstrate their ability to establish themselves successfully in Canada.  \nApplicants are not eligible if they have: \n \nnot met the definition of a CR or  HPC (RA class or RS class); \n \ncommitted a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the \ninternational instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; \n \ncommitted a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to their admission \nto that country as a refugee; or \n \nbeen found guilty of acts contrary to the purpose and principles of the United Nations.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n13 \n \n7.19. \nFamily member \nFor the purposes of the Act, other than section A12 and paragraph A38(2)(d) and for the purposes \nof the Regulations, other than sections R159.1 and R159.5, “family member\" in respect of a \nperson means: \n(a) the spouse or common-law partner of the person; \n(b) a dependent child of the person or of the person's spouse or common-law partner; and \n(c) a dependent child of a dependent child referred to in paragraph (b). \nConsistent with the use of appropriate discretion and flexibility in assessing refugees, the concept \nof family, for refugee resettlement purposes, should be considered to include de facto \ndependants. \n \n7.20. \nFOSS (Field Operations Support System) \nThe Field Operations Support System (FOSS) is an online, real-time system that serves to create, \nstore and retrieve important immigration information within Canada. It is designed to automate \nand streamline immigration processing in Canada. It provides an electronic file system to store, \ntransmit, access and retrieve immigration information online. Users at ports of entry, inland and \nCase Processing Centres can query clients, create new clients, update existing clients, create, \nmodify and delete immigration documents. Other FOSS features include printing documents, \ntracking progress on cases, and maintaining registry files. \n7.21. \nFraud \nCases of fraud are situations where a client has intentionally provided false or misleading \ninformation with respect to any aspect of the program. \nFraud exists if blatant misrepresentation of facts by the client leads to the issuance of income \nsupport to which the client was not entitled. \n7.22. \nGovernment-Assisted Refugees (GAR) \nEach year, the Government of Canada: \n \nplans for the resettlement of refugees from abroad; and \n \nsupports these refugees through the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP). \nUnder RAP, the refugees are supported at the equivalent of local provincial social assistance \nlevels for up to twelve months after their arrival in Canada. \nGARs include both CRs abroad and members of the RS class. They are selected from applicants \nreferred by the UNHCR or other designated referral agents, or, in countries deemed to have direct \naccess, present themselves on their own initiative to Canadian visa offices. Joint Assistance \nSponsorship (JAS) cases are also considered as GARs as the financial support is provided by the \ngovernment via RAP. \nFor more information, please refer to: \nIP 3 Part 2, Government-Assisted Refugees and the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP)\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n14 \n \n7.23. \nGroup of Five (G5) \nRefugees may be sponsored by any group of five or more Canadian citizens or permanent \nresidents who: \n \nare at least 18 years of age; \n \nlive in the community where the refugees are expected to settle; \n \nare not in default on any other sponsorship undertaking; and \n \nhave the necessary resources to guarantee support for the refugee(s) for the full duration of \nthe sponsorship, usually up to a 12-month period. \nG5 sponsorship groups are intended to be: \n \none-time groups; and \n \nformed in response to special situations that arise. \nFor more information, refer to IP 3, Part 3, Section 36.  \nNote:G5s are not eligible to sponsor JAS cases according to the terms and conditions of RAP. \n7.24. \nGuardianship \nMeans the relationship between an adult and a child whereby the adult has, by a written decision of the \ncompetent authority of the country where the child resides, been entrusted with the legal responsibility for \nthe child and is authorized to act on their behalf.  This is different from adoption, as it does not constitute a \nparental relationship. \n7.25. \nGuardianship Protocol \nThe Guardianship Protocol outlines procedures for processing de facto dependants and consanguineous \nminors.  It aims to protect resettled refugee children from abuse and exploitation in Canada.  Specifically, \nthis protocol ensures that refugee minors being resettled to Canada are brought into, or are part of, a bona \nfide familial relationship that can provide the necessary safety and protection of the minor until he/she \nreaches the applicable legal age of majority.  \nThe Protocol requires that the adult in a de facto or a consanguineous relationship with the minor be \ninformed of the importance of securing legal guardianship, in order to ensure the care and protection of \nthe minor.  It also requires that the minor be consulted and given the opportunity to express his/her views \nabout the arrangements being made.  \nNote: At the time of publication, a moratorium exists excluding truly separated minors from resettlement \nto Canada. Truly separated minors are defined as those children who have no adult who is capable of \nand willing to care for them either abroad or in Canada.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n3 \n \n7.26. \nHumanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad class (HPC) \nA person in similar circumstances to a Convention refugee may be a member of one of the \nfollowing HPC: \n \nthe Country of Asylum class (RA) \n7.27. \niCAMS \nThe Immigration-Contribution Accountability Measurement System (iCAMS) is a web-based data \ncapture system, which collects, stores, and reports on service information to allow CIC to \ndemonstrate accountability for the resettlement and settlement contribution programs. This \nsystem is used by SPOs and other stakeholders to keep accurate records of services and \nactivities provided to all new immigrants. \n7.28. \nInterim Federal Health (IFH) Program \nThe IFH Program provides all resettled refugees with coverage for the following, until provincial \nhealth insurance is available: \n \nessential and emergency health services for: \n the treatment and prevention of serious medical conditions; and \n the treatment of emergency dental conditions; \n \ncontraception, prenatal and obstetrical care, eye wear; and \n \napproved prescription medications (drug list is available online at http://www.fasadmin.com). \nFor the first 12 months in Canada (or longer if RAP is extended), other types of benefits may be \nprovided with the proper pre-authorization. These include: \n \nprostheses; \n \nwheelchairs; \n \nsecond and subsequent psychiatric consultations; and \n \nroutine medical examinations. \nFor more information, please see Section 10 and refer to http://www.fasadmin.com. \n7.29. \nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM) \nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) has a primary mandate to make arrangements \nfor the organized transit of foreign nationals, including refugees, displaced persons and other \nindividuals in need of international migration services. It currently arranges transportation and \nmedical examinations for refugees.  \nThe IOM has its headquarters in Geneva and has 72 offices around the world.

Because of their special needs or \ncircumstances, these persons may need an extended resettlement period, beyond 12 months, \nand assistance over and above that provided through either government assistance or regular \nprivate sponsorship. CIC may provide support through RAP for up to 24 months from the date of \narrival of the refugee. The government provides income support for the period of the sponsorship \nand the private sponsors offer moral and emotional support and guidance while ensuring that the \nrequired settlement services are accessed. \n7.31. \nMatching Centre (MC) \nThe Matching Centre (MC), part of the Operational Management and Coordination Branch (OMC), \nperforms the following activities: \nActivity \nDescription \nMaintains \nVarious lists and records, including: \n \nprofiles of refugees awaiting sponsorship; \n \ngroups who are waiting for Visa Office-Referred (VOR) sponsorship or Joint \nAssistance Sponsorship (JAS); \n \na database of arrivals and landings by target and actual figures. \nSends out \n \nmessages to visa offices outlining the requirement for profiles when a local \nCIC contacts the MC with a request from a sponsor. \nKeeps records of \n \nGAR cases; \n \nPSR cases; \n \nUrgent Protection cases; \n \nOther relevant matters. \nAssists \n \nin matching VOR and JAS cases \n \nposts VOR and JAS profiles on the secure Web site. \nDestines \n \nGARs, Urgent Protection (UPP) cases; \nCoordinates \n \nthe distribution of refugees within Canada, through DMRs. \nDetermines \n \nan appropriate location for refugee(s) having regard to information in the \nDMR. \nThis determination is based on information about: \n \nthe family and friends that the refugee(s) may have in Canada; \n \nthe special needs of the refugee;\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n5 \n \n \nthe availability of resources, including interpreters and other services, to \nsupport resettlement and integration; \n \nother factors. \nReceives and \ndistributes \n \nNotification of Arrival Transmissions (NATs) from visa offices and ensures \narrival information is distributed to the local CICs and POEs. The local CIC \nforwards the NAT to the sponsor and/or SPO. \nFor more information, please refer to: \nIP 3 Part 4, Section 51.2 – Process for JAS \nIP 3 Part 3, Section 40 – Processing of Visa Office-Referred (VOR) cases \n7.32. \nNotification of Arrival Transmission (NAT) \nA Notification of Arrival Transmission (NAT) advises the local CIC, the Port of Entry and Service \nProvider Organization (SPO) of the date of arrival and flight details of the refugee, and of pertinent \ndetails such as the names of sponsors, onward travel arrangements to final destinations, and \nspecial needs (e.g. wheelchair required), etc. NATs are required to manage levels adequately and \nto forecast accurately and are sent for all government-assisted and privately sponsored refugees. \nPlease note that each NAT is numbered sequentially beginning at 0001 at the start of each \ncalendar year (example: NAT 0001/99), followed by: \n \npoint of origin; \n \nport of entry; \n \ndate of arrival; \n \nflight details; \n \nvisa office file number; \n \nsurname, given name, DOB, sex, relationship of each family member; \n \nCountry of Last Permanent Residence (CLPR); \n \nvisa number (T #); \n \nimmigrant category;  \n \nspecial requirements;  \n \nidentification of special programs such as One-Year Window of Opportunity (OYW), Women \nat Risk (AWR), Urgent Protection Program (UPP); and  \n \nSponsor details such as name, address, telephone number and CIC file number if applicable. \nEach NAT is to contain the names of no more than 30 persons at the start of each calendar year.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n6 \n \n7.33. \nOne-Year Window of Opportunity (OYW) \nThe One-Year Window of Opportunity is a regulatory mechanism intended to reunite separated \nfamily members as quickly as possible, without the need for a family class sponsorship. Separated \nfamily members will be referred to as non-accompanying family members (NAF). \nTo be processed as NAFs, family members must: \n \nmeet the definition of a family member (see definition in Section 7.19); \n \nbe identified on the PA's permanent resident visa application (IMM 0008EGEN); \n \nbe included in the application prior to the PA’s departure for Canada;  \n \nhave submitted an application at a visa office within one year of the PA’s date of arrival in \nCanada (e.g., date of landing); and \n \nif privately sponsored, have a sponsor that has been notified and has made adequate \nsettlement arrangements.   \nFor more information, please see Section 13 \nCoding in CAIPS and FOSS: For this program, “OYW” will be entered on the visas of the NAFs \n7.34. \nOverpayment – RAP \nAn overpayment occurs when a client receives income support for which they were not entitled, \ndue to: \n \nan oversight by the RAP officer; \n \na lack of understanding on the part of the client when providing information to determine their \neligibility under the program;  \n \nunreported employment earnings by client while in receipt of RAP benefits; or \n \nfraud \n \nother. \n7.35. \nPersonal assets \nPersonal assets are those items that persons requiring financial assistance might be expected to \nown before arriving in Canada given their background, social status, or economic status. \n7.36. \nPrivately sponsored refugees \nUnder the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program, a sponsor or sponsoring group \ncommits to: \n \nreceiving the refugees; and \n \nproviding them with lodging, care, settlement assistance and other support. \nThe benchmark level of financial support under private sponsorship is equivalent to social \nassistance rates.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n4 \n \nThe refugees are supported for up to 12 months or until they become self-sufficient. In exceptional \ncases, the 12-month time frame can be extended up to 36 months with the sponsor’s agreement. \nFor more information, please refer to: \nIP 3, Part 3 – Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program  \n7.37. \nRefugee Tracking System (RTS) \nThe Refugee Tracking System (RTS) is an NHQ computer system that is used by the Matching \nCentre as a tracking tool to assist MC in managing the movement of government-assisted and \nprivately sponsored refugees into Canada.  \n7.38. \nResettlement \nResettlement is an instrument of protection and one of three durable solutions for refugees. \nResettlement occurs when a refugee in a country of asylum (or in their own country for the RS \nclass) is accepted for permanent residence in a third country such as Canada. It is a limited, but \nvitally important, remedy to refugee situations. \nAs an instrument of protection, resettlement is the best solution for some refugees. \n7.39. \nResettlement Assistance Program (RAP) \nThe Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) is a contribution program that operates within \nprogram terms and conditions and a program budget approved by the Treasury Board of Canada. \nThe program has two main components: income support and a range of immediate essential \nservices. Income support can be provided for up to 12 months for regular stream GARs, and for \nup to 24 months for JAS cases.  \nFor more information please refer to Part 2.  \n7.40. \nSecondary migration/Self-destination \nThe term “secondary migration” refers to a refugee-initiated change in destination (city or \nprovince) within the first year after arrival in Canada.  \nThe term \"self-destination\" should not be confused with secondary migration. Self-destination \noccurs before or upon arrival in Canada, when a refugee or family chooses to move to an \nalternate destination than what was pre-selected abroad for them.  \nBoth secondary migration and self-destined refugees may result in a sponsorship breakdown. For \nmore information regarding the actions needed and effects of a change in location, please see IP3 \nPart 2 Section 24 (for GARs); Part 3 Section 46.11 (for PSRs). \n7.41. \nSelf-supporting refugees \nSelf-supporting refugees are refugees who meet resettlement criteria but have sufficient financial \nresources to support themselves and their accompanying dependants and thus do not require \ngovernment assistance.  \n7.42. \nSeparated minor  \n “Separated minor” refers to persons under the age of 18, separated from both parents, and not \nbeing cared for by a legal guardian. This includes minors who are entirely on their own (truly \nseparated minors), minors who are with minor siblings but who, as a group, are unsupported by \nany adult responsible for them, and minors who are de facto dependants of an adult who is not \ntheir parent or legal guardian. \nThe preferred solution for most separated minor refugees is to:\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n5 \n \n \nreunite them with their immediate family; or \n \nplace them with their extended family. \n \nNote: A moratorium exists excluding separated minors from resettlement to Canada. Separated minors \nare defined as those children who have no adult who is capable and willing to care for them either \nabroad or in Canada. \nExceptions to the moratorium on resettling separated minors are made if: \n \nThe minor has extended family in Canada and resettlement is the only durable solution (i.e. \nthe minor is a consanguineous minor); or \n \nThe minor is in the care of an adult who is not a family member, who is willing to become the \nlegal guardian of the minor, and who is being resettled to Canada (i.e. the minor is a de facto \ndependant of the principal applicant); or \n \nThe minor is without de facto family or a blood relative in Canada who is willing to support \nhim/her (i.e. truly separated minors) and resettlement is in his/her best interests.  Such cases \nare accepted only on a case-by-case basis, in exceptional circumstances. \nNote: In general, for a truly separated minor to be accepted, provincial concurrence is required.  \n \n7.43. \nService Provider Organizations (SPOs) \nSPOs are funded by CIC to deliver Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) services directly to \nthe newcomer.  \nRAP SPO responsibilities are primarily to provide mmediate and essential services to GARs for \nthe first few weeks after arrival in Canada.  See Section 6.5 for a detailed list of SPOs’ roles and \nresponsibilities. \n \n7.44. \nSpecial needs cases \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations R157(2) defines special needs cases as persons \nwho have a greater need of settlement assistance than other applicants for protection abroad \nowing to personal circumstances including: \n \na large number of family members; \n \ntrauma resulting from violence or torture; \n \nmedical disabilities; and \n \nthe effects of systemic discrimination. \n7.45. \nSponsoring group \nA group, corporation or unincorporated organization (or any combination thereof) that is acting for \nthe purpose of sponsoring a Convention Refugee or person(s) in a refugee-like situation.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n6 \n \n7.46. \nSponsor-referred sponsorship (named sponsorship) \nIn sponsor-referred sponsorships, private sponsors identify a refugee whom they wish to assist. \nThey may involve persons with family links to Canada or be a direct response to requests from \nrefugees abroad.  \n7.47. \nSponsorship agreement \nA signed agreement between the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (or delegate) \nand a corporation in Canada to govern and facilitate the sponsorship process. For more \ninformation, refer to IP 3, Appendix C, Annex 6. \n7.48. \nSponsorship Agreement Holder (SAH) \nSponsorship Agreement Holders provide the refugees with financial and moral support. \nSAHs have the following characteristics: \n \nThey are incorporated organizations. \n \nThey vary widely in composition and type, for example: \n religious organizations; \n ethno-cultural groups; or \n other humanitarian organizations. \n \nThey have signed a sponsorship agreement with the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration \nCanada (or delegate) to facilitate the sponsorship process.  \n \nThey are completely responsible for managing sponsorships under their agreement. \n \nThey can be composed of Constituent Groups (CGs) specifically recognized and managed by \nthe SAH. \n \nThey are responsible for training and informing their CGs. \nSAHs may: \n \nundertake sponsorships on an on-going basis; \n \nmanage a sponsorship by working with a CG; \n \nhave many CGs across Canada or a few CGs in a specific region/area; \n \nwork with local CICs. \nSAHs and their CGs are eligible to sponsor JAS cases according to the terms and conditions of \nRAP. \n7.49. \nSponsorship breakdown \nSponsorship breakdown is a condition of deterioration in the sponsoring group-refugee relationship \nsuch that the sponsor is unable or unwilling to fulfill the terms of the sponsorship undertaking. \nAttempts are made to reestablish the sponsorship, but if that is not possible, CIC will formally\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n7 \n \ndeclare a breakdown in the sponsorship. Depending on the circumstances, the sponsoring group \nmay be found in default. \n7.50. \nSponsorship default \nSponsorship default refers to a breach of the contractual obligations of the sponsorship \nundertaking itself or, specifically, the failure to fulfill a financial or non-financial obligation \nassociated with the undertaking. A sponsoring group may not submit undertakings while they \nremain in default. \n7.51. \nSponsorship undertaking \nThe undertaking used for the Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program is a legal document that \nforms part of a sponsorship kit. Sponsor/refugee contact information and an overview of \nsponsorship responsibilities are provided in the undertaking. \n7.52. \nSponsorship withdrawal \nSponsorship withdrawal is the cancellation of an undertaking to sponsor that occurs before the \npermanent resident visa has been issued. It is the last option when all other attempts to fulfil the \nconditions of the sponsorship have failed or when situations have changed. \nSponsorship withdrawal: \n \nshould not be confused with sponsorship breakdown; \n \noccurs when the sponsor cancels the sponsorship undertaking prior to the issuance of the \npermanent resident visa; or \n \noccurs when the refugee withdraws their application (e.g., resettles in another country). \n7.53. \nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) \nThe office of the UNHCR is a humanitarian and non-political organization with a mandate to \nprotect refugees and promote solutions to their problems. Solutions may include voluntary \nrepatriation, local integration and, in exceptional cases, resettlement in a third country. \nLocal UNHCR offices identify persons in need of resettlement and refer them to visa offices. They \nmay also help find candidates for private sponsors. The factors that the UNHCR takes into \nconsideration when it refers a case for resettlement are described in detail in the UNHCR \nResettlement Handbook, a copy of which can be found in all visa offices. The text of the handbook \nis also available from the UNHCR Web site at: \nhttp://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home  \n7.54. \nTransportation loan  \nThe transportation loan (see OP 17, Section 13) provides financial assistance to foreign nationals, \nConvention refugees and members of the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad classes to \ncover the costs of transportation for themselves and/or their dependants to their place of final \ndestination. This also includes approved service fees from the IOM as well as other related \nexpenses.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n8 \n \n7.55. \nUnaccompanied minors  \n“Unaccompanied minor” refers to a minor who is without the company of an adult who may or may \nnot have legal responsibility for them. This term is usually used only in the context of a minor \ntraveling without adult accompaniment.  \nExample: An 11-year old separated minor travelling alone is “unaccompanied” in the same way \nthat an 11-year old child travelling alone from Europe to visit friends in Canada is also \n“unaccompanied.” If, in either case, the child were travelling in the company of an adult, the child \nwould no longer be considered “unaccompanied.” This term is NOT synonymous with “separated \nminor.” \n \n7.56. \nUrgent need of protection \nUrgent need of protection means, in respect of a member of the Convention Refugee Abroad \nclass, the Country of Asylum class, that their life, liberty or physical safety is under immediate \nthreat and, if not protected, the person is likely to be: \n \nkilled; \n \nsubject to violence, torture, sexual assault or arbitrary imprisonment; or \n \nreturned to their country of nationality or their former habitual residence. \n7.57. \nUrgent Protection Program (UPP) \nA case in need of urgent protection is one where the life, liberty or physical well-being of a refugee \nis under immediate threat. Urgent protection cases, by definition, need to be resettled on the \nurgent basis required by their particular circumstances. Consequently, these cases are to be \nassigned the highest processing priority. \nThe concept of resettlement as an instrument of protection is key to this program. Resettlement in \nurgent protection cases is undertaken as a priority where there is no other way to guarantee the \nsecurity of the person concerned. Resettlement in these cases is the best, and often the only \nprotection response. \nUrgent protection is not gender-specific; referrals may include men, women and children. For the \npurposes of the Urgent Protection Program, officers should use their best judgment in determining \nif a case requires urgent processing. Refugees in need of urgent protection should be en route to \nCanada within three to five days of referral to the visa office.  \nFor more information, please refer to: OP 5, Section 23. \n7.58. \nVisa Office-Referred sponsorship (unnamed sponsorship) \nVisa Office-Referred (VOR) sponsorship refers to situations where a refugee has been determined \nto be eligible and is referred by a visa office for sponsorship. Either a sponsor requests a VOR \ncase or a visa office refers the case to the Matching Centre (MC) to find a sponsor. The profiles of \ncases referred to the MC will be posted on the JAS/VOR secure Web site, where they can be \nviewed by SAHs and local CICs.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n9 \n \n7.59. \nVoluntary repatriation \nVoluntary repatriation occurs when a permanent resident, who was originally a resettled refugee, \ndecides to voluntarily leave Canada to return to his or her country of origin. For more information, \nrefer to Section 12. \n7.60. \nVulnerable \nR138 defines ”vulnerable,” with respect to a Convention Refugee or a person in similar \ncircumstances, as a person that has a greater need of protection than other applicants abroad \nbecause of the person’s particular circumstances which give rise to a heightened risk to their \nphysical safety.  \nNote: Persons who meet the regulatory definition of “vulnerable” are exempt from the regulatory \nrequirement to “successfully establish”. \n7.61. \nWomen-at-Risk Program (AWR) \nThe Women-at-Risk Program (AWR) is designed to offer resettlement opportunities to women in: \n \nperilous or permanently unstable situations; and \n \nin situations where urgent or expedited processing is necessary. \nWomen eligible under this program may: \n \nnot have the resettlement potential usually required by applicants under the Convention \nRefugee Abroad class or Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad classes; \n \nbe marginalized or alienated in their communities; \n \nbe vulnerable to the threat of rape, other forms of violence to themselves or to their children; \n \nbe in such critical situations that urgent processing is required; \n \nrequire help because their ability to start a new life is hampered by: \n young dependent children; \n poor ability to communicate in either official language; or \n the lack of skills necessary for employment. \nIn many cases, women eligible under the AWR and their dependent children: \n \nexperience more difficulties in resettling than other classes of refugees; \n \nwill require a Joint Assistance Sponsorship; and \n \nwill need a longer period to become integrated and established in Canada.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n10 \n \n8. \nDestining refugees \nVisa offices submit a DMR for refugees who are visa ready not less than six weeks before the \nrefugees are ready to travel, unless it is an Urgent Protection Program (UPP) case (see below).  \nThe Matching Centre (MC) must respond to the visa office within five working days of receipt of \nthe DMR for GARs. Therefore, rapid responses are required from local CICs and Regions for this \nprocess to function effectively.  \nFor UPP cases, once a DMR is submitted to the MC, the MC has 24 hours to provide a destination \nto the visa office. The refugees that fall within the UPP usually travel within three to five days of a \nconfirmed destination. \n8.1. \nDMR format \nThe DMRs are to be numerically numbered by visa office and by year. Example: On August 1, \n2002 the first DMR from Nairobi would be numbered Nairobi 001/2002 and the next DMR for that \nyear would be Nairobi 002/2002. On January 01, 2003 the first DMR number would be Nairobi \n001/2003 and so on. Also each family unit would be numerically identified on the DMR. \nEach DMR should contain the following information: \n \nvisa office file number (B #);  \n \nfull name and date of birth, sex, marital status, country of last permanent residence, \nImmigration Code, Program Code of head of family (HOF); \n \nfull name, date of birth, relationship to HOF of each family member; \n \ncontact information for friend/family member in Canada, if applicable; and \n \nany special requirements upon arrival such as wheelchair at the airport. \nNote: The Refugee Resettlement Medical Form (IMM 5544B) should accompany the DMR if there are \nsignificant medical conditions, in order to assist airports and SPOs to plan properly for the refugees’ \narrival.  \n \n8.2. \nContact information \nThe DMRs are to be sent to the Matching Centre electronically at the following e-mail address: \nMatching-Centre@cic.gc.ca \nWhen electronic communication is down, the DMR may be faxed to (613) 952-4753. \n8.3. \nDestining process \nWhen a DMR arrives at the Matching Centre (MC), the CAIPS notes for each file number will be \nreviewed before the MC refers cases to regions. Wherever possible, the MC will refer GARs to \ncommunities in Canada where close relatives have been identified in the CAIPS notes. The \nprocess for referring the cases, other than JAS and VOR cases, to the Regions/CICs is as follows: \n1. CICs where refugees may be directly destined by the Matching Centre\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n11 \n \nA number of Regions and CICs have decided not to be directly involved in the normal DMR \nprocess. These Regions and CICs will, however, continue to be directly involved and will be \nconsulted on all JAS and VOR cases. These CICs are: \n \nVancouver;  \n \nEdmonton; \n \nCalgary; and \n \nWinnipeg.  \nFor these destinations, the MC will review the information contained on the DMRs submitted by the \nvisa offices abroad along with the CAIPS notes and will make the decision on where to destine the \nrefugees. The Regions and the CICs, to which the refugees will be destined, will be copied on the \nresponse to the DMRs that the MC sends to the visa offices abroad.  \n2. CICs to consult before final destining decision \nFor CICs or Regions not identified in the previous section, the MC will review the DMRs submitted \nby the visa offices along with the relevant CAIPS notes for each file. After assessing the remaining \nfamilies on the DMR, the MC will make a referral recommendation to the CIC believed to be most \nsuitable to meet the needs of the refugees identified on the DMR. \nThe CIC will have three working days to confirm acceptance of refugee families that have been \nreferred. Should the MC not receive a response within three working days of the referral, it will \nfollow up with the CIC. If there is no response to the second e-mail, the MC will assume the CIC \naccepts the recommendation. Notification to this effect will be sent to the visa office abroad and to \nthe CICs to which the refugees have been destined. \n8.4. \nJAS and VOR cases \nAs indicated earlier, visa offices are to submit individual JAS/VOR DMRs to the Matching Centre \n(MC) for these types of referrals. Medical, security and criminality checks must be completed \nbefore these referrrals are sent to the MC. \nVisa officers must indicate in the CAIPS notes and on the DMR whether the case is a JAS or \nwhether a regular sponsorship would be appropriate and reasons for the recommendation. If a \nJAS is recommended, the officer should also recommend if a contribution should be approved to \ncover the cost of medical examination and transportation to Canada rather than the approval of a \nloan to cover these costs. Where an officer has not addressed this consideration in the CAIPS \nnotes, the MC should review the family profile and circumstances and, if warranted, seek \nclarification from the visa office on whether a contribution should be considered. \nWhere a contribution is considered warranted, the Manager of the Refugee and Resettlement \nProgram Delivery Unit, OMC, must approve the request before this information is relayed to the \nvisa office. Because there is only a limited amount of money set aside to cover these costs, care \nmust be taken not to exceed the amount allocated to cover these expenses. \nThe MC will list the details of the families identified as JAS or VOR cases on the JAS/VOR secure \nWeb site for up to six months. The secure Web site is accessible to local CICs and SAHs wishing \nto sponsor. If there is interest in a particular family, the SAH should contact the local CIC for more \ninformation. The local CIC will advise the MC of the interest and the MC will provide a more \ndetailed profile to the local CIC to share with the sponsor. In some cases the web site will indicate \nthat an interested sponsor should contact the Matching Centre for more information on the case.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n12 \n \nWhen there are friends/family in Canada or if there is a preferred destination, it will be indicated on \nthe Web site. A copy of the detailed profile will be sent to the local CIC at that location, asking that \nthey assist in finding a sponsor.  \nIf no sponsor is found within six months, the case will be referred back to the visa office for \nreconsideration and potential refusal referral back to UNHCR.  \nWhen a visa office becomes aware of a potential lengthy delay in the processing of a JAS or VOR \ncase, this information should be relayed to the sponsoring group as soon as possible to avoid \nraising expectations of the refugee’s pending arrival.  \n8.5. \nLife span of DMR \nWith the exception of JAS/VOR cases, a DMR will have a life span of three months from its date of \norigin. Where a NAT has not been provided for any family identified on a DMR within that \nthree-month period, the MC will send notification to the visa office that a new DMR will be required, \nunless the visa office had already notified the MC that additional time would be required for flight \narrangements.  \nNote: For Quebec-destined refugees, the MICC replies directly to the originating visa office with a copy to \nthe MC.  \nFor an example of a DMR, please refer to OP 5, Section 19.1 – Prepare a DMR. \n9. \nRefugee travel \n9.1. \nProcessing a Notification of Arrival Transmission (NAT) \nPlease refer to the definition of a NAT in Section 7.32. For an example of a NAT please refer to \nOP 5, Section 21.3. \nThe following seven steps occur in the processing of a NAT: \nStep \nDescription \n1 \nThe visa office sends the NAT to the Matching Centre (MC). \n2 \nThe MC: \n \nreceives the NAT; and \n \nacknowledges receipt of the NAT to the originating visa office. \nNote: If an acknowledgment is not received by next business day, the NAT must \nimmediately be sent again to the MC. A copy should be faxed to the MC at (613) \n952-4753. \nNote: The NAT should be received at least 10 working days in advance of the \nrefugees’ arrival date. \n3 \nThe MC immediately forwards the information to the local CIC and POE. \n4 \nThe local CIC sends the NAT to the sponsor and/or SPO. \n5 \nIF an amendment to the NAT is necessary (e.g., change of final destination, change of \nflight itinerary, cancellation, etc.)\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n13 \n \nTHEN the MC must be advised immediately by the originating visa office. \n6 \nInformation is forwarded immediately to the local CIC in the city of final destination and \nPOE. \n7 \nThe following incidents are to be conveyed by the Region or local CIC to the MC and \nthe visa office: \n \nunannounced arrivals; \n \nno shows; \n \nchanges in schedule; and \n \nother pertinent information, such as: \n a refugee requiring a wheelchair upon arrival and this requirement \nwas not indicated on NAT; or \n any other unmet requirements. \n9.2. \nTravel documents \nFor procedures regarding single journey travel documents, please refer to: \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/cicexplore/english/guides/om_nso/2002/op/op02-41.htm \n9.3. \nRole of the Matching Centre (MC) and Service Provider Organization (SPO) at the POE \nThe following table shows the role and responsibilities of the MC and officer or SPO at the POE. \nThe role of the: \nResponsibilities \nMatching Centre \n \nreview all Notification of Arrival Transmissions (NATs) to ensure \nflight arrangements to the final destination are included; \n \nprovide NAT details to local CIC office and POE; \n \ncontact the destining visa office when arrangements for onward \ndestining are not included; and \n \ncontact the destining visa office when travel guidelines are not \nbeing followed such as arrivals on stat holidays, after hours \narrivals, or insufficient time between connecting flights. \nNote:  Passengers need a minimum of four hours at the POE to allow for \nlanding procedures, clearing customs, distribution of winter clothing \n(between October and April) and ground transportation to a connecting \nflight. \nOfficer or \nSPO at the POE \n \nadvise sponsor of travel details; and \n \nreport to the MC when: \n travel arrangements to the final destination were not included\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n14 \n \nin the original travel plan; or \n overnight accommodation and ground transportation were \nrequired, but not previously arranged at the time travel \narrangements were made. \nNote:  Reporting information should include the NAT number, name of the \noriginating visa office and the B number assigned to the case. \n10. \nInterim Federal Health Program (IFH) and health coverage \n10.1. \nThe Interim Federal Health Program (IFH): Eligibility  \nIFH is available to all refugees including CR, RA, RS  and OYW classes, and provides: \n \nhealth service benefits for the gap between date of arrival and eligibility for provincial health \nbenefits; and \n \nlimited supplementary benefits once provincial plans commence benefits, for up to 12 months \nafter arrival or up to 24 months for JAS cases. \nThe IFH is not available to refugees who are: \n \nable to pay for their own health care services; or \n \ncovered by a private or public health care plan. \n10.2. \nInforming clients \nA client information sheet is given to the refugee. The information sheet outlines: \n \nhow the program works;  \n \nwhat it covers; and \n \ncontact information for prior approvals (by CIC) and billing (by FAS). \nClients must be cautioned: \n \nabout the limitations on IFH benefits; \n \nnot to incur any costs until they are certain that IFH will provide benefits for them; and \n \nthat medical treatments and procedures that are not covered must be paid for by the client. \n10.3. \nIFH-related forms \nThe forms related to this program are FOSS generated on the generic form IMM 1442B, and will \nconfer IFH eligibility as determined by the officer for 12 months, or a lesser period. \nThe form “Interim Federal Health Certificate” (also FOSS generated and printed on IMM 1442B) \ncontains the following information: \n \nbasic identification;\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n15 \n \n \nthe paragraphs noted in the Information Section of the IFH form (IMM 1442B);   \n \nthe client’s photograph; \n \nsignature; and \n \nIFH expiry date. \n10.4. \nInformation on IFH Form (IMM 1442B) \nIt is understood that once provincial health insurance is obtained, resettled refugees must no \nlonger use IFH for medical benefits, such as doctors’ visits or treatment at a hospital. They may, \nhowever, continue to use IFH for supplementary benefits (drugs, eyewear, etc.) for the remaining \nperiod of time as indicated on their IFH certificate. This is why the IFH forms (IMM 1442B) are \nvalid for up to 12 months after the date of arrival and contain an eligibility paragraph under \n“Remarks” which states the following: \nThe above mentioned person is eligible for benefits under the Interim Federal Health (IFH) \nProgram. Eligibility will continue until…(day/month/year)…but may be revoked before, \nshould the holder qualify for private or public health insurance or otherwise ceases to be \neligible. \nI, the undersigned, declare that I require assistance for medical care and that should my \ncircumstance change or should I qualify for any other form of medical benefits, I will no \nlonger seek to obtain benefits under the IFH program. \n \n \n10.5. \nIssuing IFH documents \nIn order to ensure that refugees have timely access to health care,  officers should issue IFH \ndocuments during their first contact with clients or as soon as possible after their arrival. \nThese documents are to be used for all eligible medical needs with procedures dependent upon \nthe client’s status in Canada and province of residence. \nThese forms provide the option to add the two paragraphs that: \n \nconfirm the refugee’s eligibility for IFH access for one year or less; and \n \nspecify the commitment to cease benefits as agreed upon once other benefit options become \navailable. \nNote:The “eligibility until” date will be up to 12 months or until the anticipated end date for payments under \nRAP. \nFor further information on IFH, refer to the IFH-related page within www.cic.gc.ca or send an e-\nmail to the general IFH inbox at CIC-IFH-Program@cic.gc.ca  \n10.6. \nIssuing extensions \nExtensions may be issued to resettled refugees who entered Canada on a TRP while their \npermanent residence is being processed for the estimated time required to finalize the case, and \nnot more than 12 months at a time.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n16 \n \n10.7. \nCovering gaps \nGaps in medical benefits may be covered by backdating the eligibility period to the day after the \nlast day of eligibility on the previous IFH certificate. \n10.8. \nReplacing lost certificates \nReplacement of lost certificates may be subject to a small fee set by the local CIC offices. \n10.9. \nBilling information \nMedical bills will be forwarded for payment by the health care provider to: \nFAS Benefit Administrators Ltd. \n9707 – 110 Street, 9th Floor \nEdmonton AB  T5K 3T4 \nMedical bills received at CIC will be returned to sender and accompanied by a note advising them \nof this address. \nClaims submitted by the clients will not be honoured. \n11. \nImmigration loans and contributions \n11.1. \nArranging transportation loans in Canada \nProcessing transportation and admissibility loans by the local CIC  \nThe request for a transportation loan to be initiated in Canada can originate within Canada or \nabroad. \nThe first step for the local CIC officer is to determine whether the loan applicant has any other \nmeans of paying for the transportation costs. The applicant should be asked to provide proof that \nthey have applied for, and been refused , a loan from a bank or other lending institution, and that \nthey do not have enough savings to pay for the travel themselves. \nSecondly, the CIC officer must ensure that the loan applicant is not in default on an existing loan \nfrom CIC. This can be done by calling Collection Services at 1-800-667-7301. The officer should \nidentify themselves and explain why they are asking about the status of the loan applicant. Note \nthat it is not necessary for any other CIC-issued loans to be fully repaid before a new loan can be \nissued. It is necessary that the loan applicant has been making ongoing payments on their existing \naccount(s). \nOnce both of the above conditions have been met, the CIC officer must verify that the dependant \nfamily members are visa-ready.  \nWhen this has been determined, the loan applicant should contact IOM-Ottawa to request an \nestimate of travel costs. Alternatively, the request for a cost estimate can be done by the local CIC \nofficer on behalf of the applicant. The local CIC office may decide not to ask for an estimate when \nthere is an urgent case. \nContact information for IOM-Ottawa is: \nInternational Organization for Migration \n151 Slater Street, Suite 712 \nOttawa, ON   \nK1P 5H3 \nPhone:    (613) 237-0651\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n17 \n \nE-mail: iomottawa@iom.int \nPlease note that IOM-Ottawa should be kept informed throughout this process. \nOnce the cost estimate has been received, the CIC officer can assist the loan applicant to fill out \nan Immigration and Admissibility Loan (IMM 0500). Refer to OP 17, sections 13.11, 16.1 and 16.2, \nbut with the following instructions: \nThe loan applicant should visit their local CIC office to sign an IMM 0500E. The IMM 0500E should \nbe completed by the local CIC officer with the loan recipient’s name and information in the top part \nof Section I, and it should list all family members who will be covered by the loan. \nThe loan applicant and the authorized officer should sign and date the bottom of the form. The rest \nof the form should be left blank, as this information will be provided by IOM. \nAll copies of the IMM 0500E should be mailed to IOM-Ottawa at the above address. A photocopy \nof the IMM 0500E can be provided to the applicant or placed on the applicant’s file. Once IOM has \ncompleted the rest of the information, copies will be returned to the CIC office. \nIf appropriate, the visa office abroad can be informed once the IMM 0500E has been submitted to \nIOM-Ottawa. If this office requires a copy of the IMM 0500E for their files, one can be faxed or \nscanned and e-mailed to them. Upon receipt of the IMM 0500E by IOM-Ottawa, the appropriate \noverseas IOM office will be contacted to proceed with travel arrangements.  \nIf a travel agent other than IOM is used for this process, the local CIC officer must ensure that the \nagent is aware of the IMM 0500E process and will accept this form of payment. \nUsing an IMM 0500E is the preferred method for an in-Canada loan applicant to undertake \nresponsibility to pay for travel costs for dependant family members overseas. However, there may \nbe instances when this is not possible; for example, 1) if an IMM 0500E has already been \ncompleted abroad, or 2) for those centres (such as New Delhi) where IOM does not make the \ntravel arrangements and would therefore not be involved in this process. In these cases the \nperson responsible for repaying the loan must complete IMM 0501B (Immigration Loan and \nUndertaking to Repay). \nTo complete IMM 0501B, refer to OP 17, Section 13.10. Please note that OP 17, Section 13.6 \nstates:  \n\"The IMM 0501B form (Immigration Loan and Undertaking to Repay) is only used in \nCanada when the head of family is in Canada and the IMM 0500E is being issued abroad \nfor dependent family members.\"  \nThis means that if an IMM 0500E is issued in Canada, it is not necessary to complete an IMM \n0501B. As well, an IMM 0501B is not valid without an accompanying IMM 0500E. An IMM 0501B \nprovides the legal means for the loan applicant to undertake responsibility to repay the travel costs \nfor their family members overseas. The IMM 0501B only provides an estimate of costs, while the \nIMM 0500E is the document that provides the actual travel, medical and other related costs \nincurred. \nThe Immigration Loans Program provides financial assistance in the form of loans or contributions \nto eligible applicants. The officer is generally the person who issues the loan. NHQ approves the \ncontributions. \nFor more information, please refer to: \nOP 17 – Loans\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n18 \n \n12. \nVoluntary repatriation  \n12.1. \nTravel documents \nWhen persons wishing to voluntarily repatriate are ineligible for a refugee travel document, the \ncountry of repatriation must: \n \nissue a travel document; or \n \nauthorize their return. \nRefugees should be referred to their nearest embassy to obtain travel documents. \n12.2. \nTravel costs \nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act does not allow for CIC to reimburse or to contribute \nto the travel costs for voluntary repatriation. Refugees seeking to return to their country of origin \nmay want to contact the UNHCR office in Canada.  \n12.3. \nPolicy \nAny permanent resident of Canada wishing to relinquish voluntarily his or her status may do so \nafter proper counselling. For more information, refer to ENF 23, Section 7.10. \nMore information regarding voluntary repatriation in the context of resettlement will follow. \n \nWhen prospects for successful integration seem impossible, and the local officer is of the opinion \nthat repatriation seems to be the only solution, then the refugee must:  \n \nbe advised that once the request for repatriation is approved, they will no longer be able to \nclaim Canadian permanent residency in the event of subsequent returns to Canada;  \n \nmake a formal application for future readmission to Canada and comply fully with the \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act and Regulations in effect at that time. \n \n13. \nOne-Year Window of Opportunity Provision (OYW) \n13.1. \nPolicy context  \nOne Year Window is a provision of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations that \nassists family reunification. It permits resettled refugees in Canada, within one year of their arrival, \nto identify family members abroad for resettlement. This policy initiative is based on the need to \nminimize the separation of refugee families during processing for resettlement. \nIn most cases, refugee families will be processed at the same time so that separation does not \noccur. However, not all families can be processed together. In some situations, family members’ \nwhereabouts are unknown. In others, the conditions in the country of origin prohibit them from \nbeing processed with the principal applicant.  \nIndividuals identified under OYW are processed as dependents of the original family member in \nthe same refugee class. As such, a visa officer does not have to examine their refugee story.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n19 \n \nHowever, as with all applications, the non-accompanying family member(s) must meet the \nstatutory requirements under IRPA Division 4 (Inadmissibilities). \n13.2. \nEligibility under OYW  \nTo be eligible under OYW, the principal applicant must have been authorized to enter Canada as a \nmember of the: \n \nConvention refugee (CR) from abroad class; or  \n \n \n \ncountry of asylum class (RA).  \nNon-Accompanying Family Members (NAF) \nFamily members who did not travel with the principal applicant are called non-accompanying \nfamily members (NAF). The OYW applies to specific non-accompanying family members. The \nnon-accompanying family member must be a family member of the PA as defined in R1(3). \nFamily members are identified as: \n \nPA’s Spouse or common-law partner  \n \nDependent children of the PA or the PA's spouse or common-law partner, \n \nDependent children of dependent children of the PA or the PA's spouse or common-law \npartner. \nNote: De facto dependants are not eligible under the OYW program as they do not meet the definition of \nfamily member outlined in R1(3).  \nIndividuals must have been a family member at the time the PA originally submitted his/her \napplication for permanent residence and continue to be a family member when a final decision on \nthe one-year window application is made (R142).  \nAge exemption \nAge is the only exception to the requirement that a non-accompanying family member meet the definition \nof “family member” both at the time the PA’s application is made and at the time a final decision is made. \nAs per R142(b), the age of any dependent child is locked in on the date the PA submits their application for \npermanent residence. Therefore, a person who has turned 22 since the original application was made, and \nwho meets all other requirements, will still qualify as a dependent child under the OYW. \n13.3. \nRequirements for the OYW  \nIn addition to being eligible, R141(1) states that non-accompanying family members must: \n \nhave been identified on the PA's Application for Permanent Residence [IMM 0008] before the \nPA departed for Canada; \n \nhave submitted their own Application for Permanent Residence at a visa office within one year \nof the date of arrival of the PA in Canada.\nIP 3 – In-Canada Processing of Convention Refugees Abroad and Members \nof the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Classes – Part 1 (General) \n2011-10-07 \n \n20 \n \n \nnot be found to be inadmissible; \n \nhave satisfied an officer that their sponsor has been made aware of the family member’s \napplication and that there are adequate financial arrangements for resettlement.  \n \nNote: The NAFs may not arrive in Canada within the year following the arrival of the PA. However, their \napplication must be submitted to the visa office that serves their area within the one year period. \nApplications made under OYW do not need to be accompanied by a referral from the UNHCR, another \nreferral agency, or an undertaking. \nInadmissibility \nFamily members will be examined to determine that they are not inadmissible to Canada. Reasons \nfor inadmissibility include the individual posing a threat to national security, having a history of \nserious or organized crime, having committed violations of international or human rights, being a \ndanger to public health, or engaging in misrepresentation. These inadmissibilities are outlined in \nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, sections 34-40. Only visa officers can make a \njudgment on inadmissibility; local CIC officers cannot refuse an applicant on the basis of \nsuspected inadmissibility. \n \n13.4. \nRelevant OYW forms \n \nThe following forms are relevant to processing OYW cases and should be consulted as \nnecessary: \n \n \nRequest for processing family members under the One-Year Window of Opportunity  \n(IMM5571);  \n \nApplication for permanent residence in Canada [IMM 0008 Generic] \n \nSchedule 1 Background/Declaration [IMM 0008 Schedule 1] \n \nSchedule 2 Refugees Outside Canada [IMM 0008 Schedule 2] \n \nUse of a Representative [IMM 5476], if applicable \n13.5. \nA OYW application guide and forms is available on the CIC website: \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/fam-follow.asp \nNote: For further information on processing non-accompanying family members: \nFor Government-Assisted Refugees (GAR), please refer to IP 3, Part 2, Section 24. \nFor Privately Sponsored Refugees (PSR), please refer to IP 3, Part 3, Section 41. \nFor Joint Assistance Sponsorships (JAS), please refer to IP 3, Part 4, Section 51."
