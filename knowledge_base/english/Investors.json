component for the Investor Program is the responsibility of Permanent Resident Policy and \nPrograms Division, Immigration Branch \n \nSection 5.3 has updated links. \nSection 8.3, What is a qualifying business?, has been amended to provide instructions on how to assess \nentrepreneur or investor applicants’ “business experience.” Officers are now required to consider the \naggregate financial information of more than one business.  \n \nSection 8.4, Calculating percentage of equity, has been added. \n \nSection 9.3 has minor clarifications.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \n \n1. \nWhat this chapter is about  \nThis chapter outlines the broad objectives of the Business Immigration Program. It focuses \nspecifically on procedures used at missions abroad to process investor foreign nationals.  \nThe Business Immigration Program includes three classes of foreign nationals: \n• \nentrepreneurs; \n• \ninvestors;  \n• \nself-employed persons. \nThe chapter reviews: \n• \nthe regulatory definitions;  \n• \nselection criteria; and  \n• \noperational issues. \nProcedures related to federal skilled workers are contained in chapter OP 6.  Procedures related \nto entrepreneurs and self-employed foreign nationals are discussed in chapter OP 8. \n2. \nProgram objectives \nThe principles of the Business Immigration Program are in keeping with the overall objectives of \nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (A3) and specifically those in A3(1)(a) and (c). \nThe Program's objectives are: \n• \nto promote economic development and employment by attracting people with capital, business \nacumen and entrepreneurial skills; \n• \nto develop new commercial opportunities and to improve access to growing foreign markets by \n\"importing\" people who are familiar with those markets and their special requirements and customs; \n• \nto support provincial and territorial economic objectives.   \n3. \nThe Act and Regulations \nSections of the Act applying to business foreign nationals  \nProvision \nAct and Regulations \nRight to come into Canada \nA18, A19, A20 \nGeneral principle of admissibility \nA12(2) \nApplication for visas \nA11, A12(2) \nObligation on officer to impose conditions \nA14, A14(2)(d), A32(d) \nAuthority for an official of a province to impose conditions \nA9(1)(d) \nAuthority for interviews by designated officer \nA11(1), A15, A16 \nAuthority to prescribe conditions \nA14(2)(d)\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nSpecific Regulations applying to entrepreneurs, investors or self-employed foreign \nnationals  \nProvision \nAct and Regulations \nDefinition of: \n \nInvestor \nR88 \nBusiness Experience \nR88 \nFull-time job equivalent \nR88 \nNet assets, net income, net worth \nR88 \nPercentage of equity \nR88 \nQualifying business \nR88 \nSelection criteria, investor  \nR102 \nAuthority to issue visas \nA11 \nPoints, investor and entrepreneur \nR78, R79, R81, R103, \nR104 \nForeign nationals to the province of Quebec \nR96(b) \nSelection criteria - experience factor (entrepreneurs and investors) \nR103 \nSubstitution of evaluation \nR109 \nMinimum points to pass  Investor \nR108(2) \n3.1. \nForms required \nForm title \nForm number \nApplication for Permanent Residence in Canada \nIMM0008EGEN \nThe Guide for Business Applicants and the \nBusiness Immigration Application Form \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/applications/ \nbusiness.html \nIMM4000 \n4. \nInstruments and delegations \n \nA16(1), A16(2)(a)  \nDesignated Immigration Officer \nTemporary Visa Officer \nImmigration Control Officer \nForeign Service Immigration Officer \nSenior Foreign Service Immigration Officer \nDeputy Program Manager \nProgram Manager Satellite Office \nImmigration Program Manager \nR88(1) \"Agent\" \nNot to be delegated  \nR88(1) \"entrepreneur\" \nDesignated Immigration Officer \nTemporary Visa Officer \nImmigration Control Officer \nForeign Service Immigration Officer \nSenior Foreign Service Immigration Officer \nDeputy Program Manager \nProgram Manager Satellite Office \nImmigration Program Manager \nR88(1) \"entrepreneur selected by a \nprovince\" \nNot to be delegated  \nR88(1) \"investor\" \nDesignated Immigration Officer \nTemporary Visa Officer \nImmigration Control Officer \nForeign Service Immigration Officer\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nSenior Foreign Service Immigration Officer \nDeputy Program Manager \nProgram Manager Satellite Office \nImmigration Program Manager \nR88(1) \"investor selected by a \nprovince\" \nNot to be delegated  \nR88(1)  \"self-employed person \nselected by a province\" \nNot to be delegated  \nR91 \nNHQ - Director, Permanent Resident Policy and Programs \nR93(1) \nNHQ - Director, Permanent Resident Policy and Programs \nR93(2) \nNHQ - Director, Permanent Resident Policy and Programs \nR94 \nNHQ - Director, Permanent Resident Policy and Programs \nR102(1) \nDesignated Immigration Officer \nTemporary Visa Officer \nImmigration Control Officer \nForeign Service Immigration Officer \nSenior Foreign Service Immigration Officer \nDeputy Program Manager \nProgram Manager Satellite Office \nImmigration Program Manager \nR105(2) \nDesignated Immigration Officer \nTemporary Visa Officer \nImmigration Control Officer \nForeign Service Immigration Officer \nSenior Foreign Service Immigration Officer \nDeputy Program Manager \nProgram Manager Satellite Office \nImmigration Program Manager \nR108(1) \nDesignated Immigration Officer \nTemporary Visa Officer \nImmigration Control Officer \nForeign Service Immigration Officer \nSenior Foreign Service Immigration Officer \nDeputy Program Manager \nProgram Manager Satellite Office \nImmigration Program Manager \nR109(1) \nDesignated Immigration Officer \nTemporary Visa Officer \nImmigration Control Officer \nForeign Service Immigration Officer \nSenior Foreign Service Immigration Officer \nDeputy Program Manager \nProgram Manager Satellite Office \nImmigration Program Manager \nR109(2) \nProgram Manager Satellite Office \nImmigration Program Manager\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \n5. \nDepartmental policy \n5.1. \nPromoting the investor class overseas \nOfficers, as operational exigencies allow, may encourage individuals to apply as investors in a \nvariety of ways. This section outlines steps and activities officers may undertake to promote \nbusiness immigration overseas. \n5.2. \nHolding business immigration seminars \nWhere potential demand warrants, business immigration seminars may be held to: \n• provide information about the program; \n• field questions from those in attendance; and  \n• clarify the roles and responsibilities of the federal government and the provincial governments.  \n5.3. \nSupplying promotional material \nApplication information: The Guide for Business Applicants and the Business Immigration \nApplication Form can be found on the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) Web site at \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/guides/4000ESap.pdf (Simplified Application Process) or \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/guides/4000E.PDF(Regular Application Process) or can be \nobtained at visa offices abroad.  \nOther promotional material may be available from the provinces or other agencies. \n5.4. \nPre-application counselling and promotion \nOfficers are well placed to provide objective information about the investor program to applicants \nand third party representatives and are encouraged to take an active promotion and marketing \nrole. This approach is subject to operational constraints. \nPromotional efforts should familiarize potential applicants with the services offered by provincial \ngovernments to business foreign nationals. Where feasible, officers should coordinate their \npromotional efforts with those of provincial government representatives who may also be active in \nthis field. \n5.5. \nObtaining relevant information (A11) \nThe onus is on the applicant to produce all relevant information in support of their application. \nThe applicant is expected to provide original supporting documentation or certified copies as part \nof the application. If copies are provided with the application, originals must be produced at \ninterview if requested. \nThe applicant will need to provide certified translations in English or French, and an interpreter, as \nrequired. The interpreter must be a professional, and neither a friend, relative, employee, lawyer \nnor consultant of the applicant. \n5.6. \nInterviews \nUnder the IRPA Regulations, members of the business foreign nationals class may or may not be \ncalled to an interview. This puts them on a par with other classes of foreign nationals: \n• where the documentation submitted with the application clearly establishes eligibility, and you \nare satisfied it is authentic, waiving the interview may be appropriate;\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \n• where it clearly establishes that the applicant is not eligible, officers must refuse. \n5.7. \nInterviewing dependants \nOfficers may require the dependants' presence if their presence is necessary for the purpose of \nassessing the application. This applies whether or not they will accompany the principal applicant \nto Canada.  Members of a family do not have to be interviewed at the same time and place.  \nA15 authorizes officers to interview the principal applicant and any dependants at the visa office \nor at any other appropriate location. There are no limitations upon what is considered appropriate, \nbut the officer should have reasons for requiring the presence of dependants at an interview.  \nAs always, all statutory requirements (including medical, criminal, security, truthfulness and proof \nof relationship to the dependants) must be met before a visa may be issued.  \n5.8. \nCompliance with provincial and territorial guidelines \nOfficers are obliged to apply the regulatory definition of investor and not the policy choice of the \nfederal or provincial government.  \nSome provinces or territories may have developed other definitions for use within their \njurisdictions. These reflect provincial or territorial priorities, experience and knowledge of local \nconditions. However, they are not requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection \nAct and Regulations and do not have the force of law.  \nOfficers should encourage successful applicants to take advantage of the post-right of entry \ncounselling services that some provinces or territories may offered.  \n5.9. \nCost recovery fee and right of permanent residence fee (RPRF) \nThe cost recovery fee is payable at the time the application is made and is not refundable.  The \ncost recovery fee must only be charged for persons who intend to immigrate to Canada. \nThe RPRF is only refundable, upon request, to applicants who do not obtain permanent resident \nstatus. RPRF is also only for persons who intend to immigrate to Canada.  \nSuccessful applicants who decide not to use their visas must return them to the visa office in \norder to obtain a RPRF refund. Unsuccessful applicants should be informed as part of the refusal \nletter that they are entitled to a RPRF refund. The visa office that finalized a case is responsible \nfor processing any related RPRF refund if the RPRF has been paid. \nNon-accompanying dependants do not pay these fees even though they must undergo statutory \nprocessing.  \n5.10. \nRequest to change class \nApplicants are assessed in the class applied for.   \nAn applicant may not change foreign national classes. R90(2) requires investor applicants be \nassessed against R88 and to be refused if not a member of the investor class. \nFollowing the selection decision, there is no provision to change class within the program after the \nvisa is issued.   \n5.11. \nEffect of changing categories on cost recovery fees \nIn the current regulatory package, there is no provision to change categories. \n5.12. \nReleasing information to provinces and territories \nRequests for information from the provinces and territories should be accommodated, subject to \nthe provisions of the Privacy Act and Access to Information Act.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nA number of provinces have negotiated Memoranda of Understanding to facilitate the exchange \nof information. Permanent Resident Policy and Programs Division manages this. \n5.13. \nRequesting and reviewing documentation - general (A16) \nOfficers may request documentation to support the applicant's application. The documentation \nrequested should primarily provide evidence about the applicant's financial position and previous \nbusiness experience. Prior business experience is a prerequisite.  \n5.14. \nProcessing priority \nOfficers should accord the same processing priority to business foreign nationals as to other \ncategories of foreign nationals. Applicants must understand that their application will not receive \nspecial consideration because they may have chosen to be represented by a lawyer or \nconsultant. Lawyers and consultants representing business applicants should comply with the \nsame standards applying to third party representatives in any other kind of foreign national case. \n5.15. \nApplying procedural fairness \nWhen the officer has concerns about eligibility or admissibility, the applicant must be given a fair \nopportunity to correct or contradict those concerns. The applicant must be given an opportunity to \nrebut the content of any negative provincial assessment that may influence the final decision.  \nThe officer has an obligation to provide a thorough and fair assessment in compliance with the \nterms and spirit of the legislation and procedural fairness requirements. \n5.16. \nFile retention and disposal \nThe records of successful investors must be retained for three years from the date of visa \nissuance. Records of refused applicants must be retained five years from the date of final \ndisposition \n5.17. \nCAIPS records  \nThe visa office should make its microfilmed or CAIPS records available to inland offices upon \nrequest, subject to the Privacy Act. Information from the visa office may assist in determining \nwhether there has been any misrepresentation on the application for permanent residence.  \nPermanent Resident Policy and Programs Division at NHQ has access to CAIPS. The Division \nwill review case notes from time to time, following contact with a province or a mission.  \n6. \nDefinitions \n6.1. \nAudits \nThe objective of an audit is to express an opinion as to whether the financial statements present \nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles. This is the highest form of assurance. The auditor performs the audit with \nan attitude of professional scepticism and seeks reasonable assurance whether the financial \nstatements are free of material misstatement. \n6.2. \nCompilation engagements \nCompilation engagements are engagements in which a public accountant receives information \nfrom a client and arranges it into the form of a financial statement. The public accountant is \nconcerned that the assembly of information is arithmetically correct; however, the public \naccountant does not attempt to verify the accuracy or completeness of the information provided.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nIn Canada, it would be unusual for a small private business to have an audit. The Canadian \nBusiness Corporations Act requires an audit if sales exceed $10,000,000 but even in that case, if \nthe company is closely held, it can waive the audit requirement.  \n6.3. \nFinancial statements \nA complete set of financial statements generally includes:  \n• \nbalance sheet (see Financial statements: balance sheet, section 6.4)  \n• \nincome statement (or Statement of Income and Retained Earnings), (see Financial statements: \nincome statement, section 6.5);  \n• \nstatement of changes in financial position; and  \n• \nnotes to the financial statements.  \n6.4. \nFinancial statements: balance sheet \nAny asset or liability which will be converted into cash within one year is defined as current and \nthe difference between current assets and current liabilities provides some indication of a \ncompany's liquidity and solvency.  \nThe balance sheet provides a snapshot in time (usually at the business's year-end). Assuming \nthat the information provided is accurate, it provides an indication of the assets available to \nconduct business operations and an indication of the scope of operations.  \nThe balance sheet's accounting equation is liabilities (the money supplied by creditors) plus the \nowners' equity (money supplied by owners) equals the assets (the total money invested in the \ncompany) as shown in the following table. \nBalance sheet accounting equation \nThis \nPlus this \nEquals this \nLiabilities \nOwners' Equity \nAssets \nthe money supplied by \ncreditors \nmoney supplied by owners and \nretained earnings \nthe total money invested in the \ncompany \nA series of balance sheets can reveal the soundness of the company's structure.  \nWhen reviewing the balance sheet, it should be remembered that it is based on historical \ntransactions. As a result, it discloses a book value that may not correspond to the market value of \nan enterprise.  \nNote:  Fixed assets will be recorded at historical cost less an estimate for depreciation which may not \nbear any resemblance to fair market value. This is especially true with land since fair market value \nmay be many times the original cost.  \n6.5. \nFinancial statements: income statement \nThe income statement measures a company's sales (revenue), expenses and earnings over a \nspecified time period, usually one year. It provides an indication of the scope of operations (along \nwith the balance sheet).  \nThe income statement is a good indicator of a company's financial performance. Earnings and \ntrends in earnings are the best indicators of a company's financial well-being. Changes or trends \nin financial position should indicate whether the company is growing or declining.  \nThe income statement should help the officer determine the company's net book value (if the \nbusiness were to be sold, how much would it realize?) and the number of its employees (from the \nwage and salary expenses).\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nIn some cases, small businesses may only be able to produce an income statement generated \nspecifically for tax purposes.  \n6.6. \nFull-time equivalent \nFull-time equivalent means 1950 hours per year of paid employment and may consist of either \none person working full-time, or several people working the equivalent of a full-time position. \n6.7. \nImmigrant Investor Program (IIP) promissory note \nThe promissory note is the physical equivalent of the debt obligation referred to in the \nRegulations. The promissory note is provided to the investor by CIC, on behalf of the provinces, \nas evidence of their $400,000 investment. Investors are required to present their promissory \nnotes to Permanent Resident Policy and Programs Division at the indicated redemption date for \nrepayment. \n6.8. \nImmigrant Investor Program (IIP) Subscription Agreement \nThe IIP Subscription Agreement sets out the operation and administration of the program within \nthe context of the regulatory framework and is a legally binding contract. \n6.9. \nInvestor \nAn investor is an foreign national who: \n• \nhas business experience; \n• \nhas a legally obtained net worth of at least $800,000; \n• \nindicates in writing to an officer that they intend to or have made an investment of CDN $400,000. \n \nPersonal net worth statement  \nThe personal net worth statement includes both business and personal assets and liabilities of \nthe applicant as well as those of the spouse or common-law partner.  \n6.10. \nReview engagements \nReview engagements are distinguishable from audits in that the scope of review is less than that \nof an audit and therefore the level of assurance provided is lower. A review consists primarily of \nenquiry, analytical procedures and discussion related to information supplied to the public \naccountant by the enterprise with the limited objective of assessing whether information being \nreported on is plausible within the framework of appropriate criteria.  \n7. \nProcedure: Assessing investors’ eligibility \nThe following sections outline procedures officers will follow to assess investor applications. The \nsections are set out as follows: \nPre-Application Counselling, see Section 7.2 \nAssessing Eligibility - Selection Criteria, see Section 8 \nMaking the Eligibility Decision,  see Section 10 \nMaking the Admissibility Decision, see Section 12 \nIssuing the Immigrant Visa, see Section 12.1\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nInvestors Destined to Quebec, see Section 13 \nRefusals, see Section 14 \nHandling Payment of Investment, see Section 9 \n7.1. \nRole of federal officials \nWith the exception of Quebec, the provinces and territories are not directly involved in the \nselection process. There are, however, federal-provincial agreements that allow specific \nprovinces to nominate foreign nationals who have investment experience. The federal \ngovernment has exclusive responsibility for selecting foreign nationals in the investor category. A \nnumber of provinces may, in the future, enter into agreements that would allow them to select \ninvestors.  \n \nRoles and responsibilities in processing Quebec cases  \nThe Canada-Quebec Accord gives Quebec authority to select investors and to operate its own \nImmigrant Investor Program (IIP). R96 provides regulatory authority. \nInvestors in Quebec's IIP must intend to settle in the province of Quebec and must obtain a \nCertificat de sélection (CSQ) as proof of their selection by Quebec. \n7.2. \nForms \nSchedule 6, together with the IMM 0008EGEN, provides a snapshot of the applicant’s financial \nstatus and business experience. Missions may need to tailor additional forms that are location \nspecific. \n \nPre-Application Counselling \nAs operational exigencies allow, the officer should provide information to the prospective investor \nprior to receiving the application. The officer, for example, could: \n• \ndiscuss with the applicant the possibility of an exploratory visit to Canada; and  \n• \nensure the applicant has all the documentation required. \n \nEncouraging exploratory visits  \nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act encourages investors to make exploratory visits to \nCanada and grants six assessment points for doing so.  \n7.3. \nEnsuring that the applicant has all necessary documentation to make the application \nOfficers should ensure that: \n• \nin addition to the usual counselling material, the information package given to a prospective applicant \nincludes clear information on what supporting documentation will be needed to assess an applicant's \nability to meet the definition;  \n• \napplicants are asked to submit a version of the Personal Worth Statement and Business Applicant \nSummary with their application.  \n8. \nProcedure: Assessing eligibility – selection criteria \nTo be approved as an investor, the applicant must:\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \n• \nmeet the regulatory definition of an investor; and  \n• \ncomply with the selection criteria for the investor category. \nThis section outlines the elements an officer must consider to determine whether the regulatory \ndefinition of investor is met.  \n8.1. \nDoes the applicant meet the regulatory definition of investor? \nR90(2) mandates the refusal of any application where the applicant does not  meet the regulatory \ndefinition of investor. If it is clear that an applicant does not meet the definition, no further analysis \nis required.    \nThe officer determines whether the applicant meets the regulatory definition, which consists of \nthree distinct criteria. The investor must: \n• \nhave business experience; \n• \nhave a legally obtained net worth of at least $800,000; and \n• \nprovide a written statement to an officer that they intend to make or have already made an investment \nof $400,000.  \nInvestors must pay CDN $400,000 to the Receiver General for Canada before a visa can be \nissued. \n8.2. \nWhat is business experience? \nThe Regulations set out three clear criteria that must be met for the applicant's business \nexperience to be satisfactory to an officer: \n• \nqualifying business; \n• \ntime; \n• \nrole. \n8.3. \nWhat is a qualifying business (R88)? \nA qualifying business is defined as a business: \n• \nwhich is not a business for deriving investment income (interest, dividend, or capital gains); and  \n• \nfor which documentary evidence of the applicant's participation in the business must be provided for \nat least two of the following attributes: \nAttribute \nEquity \nMultiplied by:  \nEqual or greater than \n1 \nPercentage of equity \ncontrolled by applicant \nNumber of full-time jobs \n(equivalents) \n2 full-time job equivalents \n2 \nPercentage of equity \nTotal annual sales($) \n$ 500,000 \n3 \nPercentage of equity \nAnnual net income($) \n$   50,000 \n4 \nPercentage of equity \nNet assets \n$ 125,000 \n \nIn the past, officers were instructed to assess each business in which an applicant holds a \npercentage of equity, and if no single business could satisfy the requirements, then the definition \nof “qualifying business” was deemed to have not been met.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nHowever, in Thomas v. MCI (FCC 2006), the judge held that visa officers commit a reviewable \nerror when they fail to consider the aggregate financial result from all of an applicant's \nbusinesses. \n \nTherefore, when assessing an Entrepreneur or Investor applicant’s “business experience,” where \napplicable, visa officers should consider the aggregate financial information of more than one \nbusiness. This can be done using the same calculation—the percentage of equity held by the \napplicant/spouse multiplied by the variables concerned (annual sales, net income, full-time \nequivalents and net assets). However, when determining whether the applicant has managed a \n“qualifying business,” the sum of these calculations for all businesses will be the figure compared \nagainst the minimum thresholds found in R88(1). \n \nIt is anticipated that the majority of Investor and Entrepreneur applicants will rely on a single \nbusiness or,  in the case of Investor applicants, choose to declare management experience in \norder to demonstrate “business experience.”  \n \nGiven the potential workload implications, such aggregate assessments should be made only \nwhere they are clearly relevant to the selection decision, such as a decision to refuse the \napplicant.   \n \nExample: \n \nAn applicant owns a percentage of equity in three businesses with the following characteristics: \n \n \nCompany \nA \nApplicant's \nShare \nCompany \nB \nApplicant's \nShare \nCompany \nC \nApplicant's \nShare \nTotal: \n (A) + (B) \n+ (C) \nMinimum \nRequired \nby R88(1) \nMin. \nMet?\n% of \nEquity \n33%  \n50% \n \n25%\n \n  \n  \n  \nSales \n $ 75,000   $    24,750  \n \n$200,000   $  100,000  \n \n$500,000   $  125,000  \n \n$249,750   $  250,000 \nX \nNet \nAssets \n $ 56,000   $    18,480  \n \n$125,000   $    62,500  \n \n$250,000   $    62,500  \n \n$143,480   $  125,000 \n√ \nNet \nIncome \n $ 12,000   $      3,960  \n $ 45,000   $    22,500  \n $ 50,000   $    12,500  \n $ 38,960   $    50,000 \nX \nFTEs \n3 \n1 \n4 \n2\n4 \n1\n4 \n2\n√ \n \n \nAs this example illustrates, the definition of “qualifying business” is not successfully met by any \none business on its own. However, when one considers the aggregate total for the applicant’s \nshare of sales, net assets, net income and full-time equivalents in all three businesses, the \ndefinition is met.  \n \n8.4. \nCalculating percentage of equity \n \nIn order to determine the percentage of equity controlled by an Investor applicant (and their \nspouse, where applicable) it may be necessary to look beyond the legal or de jure control of \nshares in the qualifying business. \n \nIn certain circumstances, legal control of a portion of the qualifying business' equity may rest with \nanother individual—but may still be considered part of the applicant's percentage of equity. For \nexample, in jurisdictions where the law precludes non-citizens from legally controlling a majority\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \ninterest in a business, other documents may exist, such as trust or licensing agreements, that \nbetter reflect the effective or de facto control of the business. \n \nIn many of the Gulf States, non-citizen applicants legally own 49% of the capital stock of a \ncorporation, with agreements stipulating full control over the assets, obligations and profits of the \ncorporation in return for a small licensing fee to the Gulf national or 51% shareholder. In such a \nscenario, the equity percentage for the \"qualifying business\" calculation would be 100%.  \n \nWhere there are serious concerns that such documents or agreements were produced solely for \nthe purposes of satisfying Immigration requirements, an officer must be satisfied that the \napplicant has not engaged in an artificial transaction [R89]. However, these agreements should \nalways be considered within the local context, as the legal environment in certain countries can \nmake them a necessity for a non-citizen operating a business.     \n8.5. \nWhat is the time factor? \nFor the applicant's business experience to count, it must have been accumulated during at least \ntwo years in the five-year period before the date of application or decision. What role must the \ninvestor have played? \nThe investor’s role in the business must have been either:  \na) management and control of a percentage of equity of the qualifying business as shown in the \nfollowing table. (There is no minimum percentage of equity requirement and the investor must \nprovide documentary evidence for at least two attributes out of four.) \nAttribute \nPercentage of equity controlled by applicant \n \n100 % \n50 % \n33.33 % \nEmployment \n2 \n4 \n6 \nTotal Annual  \nSales ($) \n500,000 \n1000,000 \n1,500,000 \nAnnual Net \nIncome($) \n50,000 \n100,000 \n150,000 \nNet Assets at \nYear-End \n125,000 \n250,000 \n375,000 \nOr \nb) management of five full-time job equivalents (each job equivalent is 1,950 hours of paid \nemployment per year). The management experience must be in business. \n \nAssessing net worth and provenance of funds concern  \nThe Regulations anticipate that an applicant would have to establish ownership and valuation of \nthe assets. Concerns over the provenance of funds are addressed in both the IRPA and the \nRegulations. Officers have authority to require evidence to establish admissibility and the power \nto reject an applicant for failing to discharge the obligation. \n \nPersonal net worth statement  \nThe Regulations set out a requirement for a minimum net worth of $800,000, although there is no \nrequirement for a minimum amount to be transferred to Canada. Net worth is critical to the \nassessment of business intent and ability.  \nA16(1) imposes the obligation on applicants ‘to answer truthfully’ and ‘produce … all relevant \nevidence and documents’ reasonably required by the officer.  A11(1) requires that a visa may \nonly be granted if the officer ‘is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets \nthe requirements of the Act.’\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nThe new Act also provides broader grounds and less onerous conditions to reject applicants. \nA40(1)(a) provides for the rejection of applicants for misrepresentation of a material fact, namely \n\"for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter \nthat induces or could induce an error in the administration of this Act.\"  A41 provides officers \nauthority to find applicants inadmissible for \"an act or omission which contravenes directly or \nindirectly a provision of this Act.\"  The new legislation provides officers with the tools to \nreasonably require evidence to establish admissibility A16(1) and subsequently to reject the \napplicant when not satisfied of their admissibility A11(1) or else when provided false material \ninformation such as control and ownership of the business and net worth A40(1)(a). Similarly, \nofficers may refuse applicants under A41 for any act or omission. \nIn addition to broader legal authorities, the Act provides a wide context for officers to examine \nbusiness applicants. Net worth is required of both entrepreneurs and investors, enabling officers \nto consider its provenance for both categories. Similarly, the similar definition of business \nexperience provides a context for officers to examine, in detail, the business operations of both. \nThe requirement to evaluate business experience and net worth, and the onus on the applicant to \ndocument each requirement ostensibly provides the means to satisfy concerns about provenance \nof funds and past business behaviour. \n8.6. \nWhat should be included in a personal net worth statement? \nSchedule 6 is submitted with the application. This captures the personal net worth statement of \nboth business and personal assets and liabilities for the applicant and spouse, common law or \nconjugal partner.  \nOfficers should: \n• \nreview this document to satisfy themselves as to the completeness, valuation, ownership, existence \nand presentation of the component assets and liabilities; \n• \nrequire applicants to provide documentation to support the value of assets referred to on this \nstatement (bank statements, property valuations, etc.);   \n• \nfunds tied up in jointly owned businesses, real estate, stocks, antiques or jewellery may not be \navailable for transfer to Canada; \n• \nfunds may be in non-convertible currencies; \n• \nexchange controls may restrict movement of capital to Canada. \n9. \nProcedure: Handling payment of investment \n9.1. \nEnsuring the applicant has the intent to make or has made an investment of $400,000 \nThe officer must ensure that a direct payment of CDN $400.000 has been made to the Receiver- \nGeneral for Canada. Before visa issuance, the officer must receive verification from CIC in \nOttawa. \n9.2. \nDepositing CDN $400,000 \nApplicants can make their $400,000 investment anytime after an application has been submitted; \nhowever, payment will not be required until immediately prior to visa issuance when all other \nimmigration matters have been resolved. Visas will not be issued prior to such payment.  \nThe wire transfer form allowing applicants to wire their $400,000 directly to CIC in Ottawa is on \nthe CIC Web site.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nCitizenship and Immigration Canada \nRevenue Accounting \nJean Edmonds Tower North \n4th Floor, 300 Slater Street \nOttawa, Ontario \nCanada \nK1A 1L1 \nArrangements to finance the $400,000 investment are the applicant's responsibility. \nCIC will confirm receipt of any such arrangements directly with the lender. Again, all \ncorrespondence should clearly note the applicant's complete name, immigration file number, and \nthe Canadian visa office where the application is being processed. This is critical to ensure the \ninvestment is quickly and accurately linked to the immigration application. \nIf the IIP promissory note is to be pledged as collateral, applicants must arrange with the lender to \nnotify CIC at the address above.  \n \nSigning the IIP Subscription Agreement  \nThe Subscription Agreement can be found at the CIC Web site or may be obtained at visa offices \nabroad. Two copies of this document must be signed and submitted along with the $400,000 \npayment.  \nThe Subscription Agreement also sets out the operation and administration of the program within \nthe context of the regulatory framework.  \nAs a legally binding contract, applicants must read it carefully and indicate acceptance by signing \ntwo copies and sending them to the address above.  \nCIC in Ottawa will execute the Subscription Agreement and return one copy to the applicant.  \nThe debt obligation or promissory note, which advises investors of the provincial distribution of \ntheir $400,000 and redemption date will be sent to the investor or his designated lender upon \nallocation to the provincial funds. \n \nVerification of investment  \nCIC-NHQ (Permanent Resident Policy and Programs Division) will advise the visa office once \npayment has cleared, so that the case can be finalized and visas issued to investors and their \ndependants.  \nThere are no refunds after visa issuance.  \nIf an investor wishes to withdraw the application before visa issuance, they should immediately \ninform the visa office and CIC in Ottawa. If a visa has not been issued, CIC will return the \n$400,000 to the applicant within 90 days of the request. In the event an investor has made an \ninvestment and a visa is refused, investors will be advised and their investment will be refunded \nwithin 90 days of a request for refund. \n9.3. \nRedemption of investment \nInvestors will be repaid by CIC in Ottawa. The date of repayment depends on the date CIC \nreceives the investment and is 30 days after the maturity date provided for on the Investor’s \nPromissory Note. At the earliest, this will be in five years, two months and at the latest, five years, \nthree months from the date of receipt.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \n10. \nProcedure: Making the eligibility decision \nBased on a review of the above elements of the application, the officer will either determine that \nthe applicant: \n• \nis not eligible and refuse the case; or  \n• \nmeets the regulatory definition and proceed to examine the case according to the selection criteria.  \n11. \nProcedure: Assessing investors – applying the selection criteria \nThis section outlines the procedures an officer must follow in assessing an applicant against the \nselection criteria for investors, once the regulatory definition has been satisfied. \nThe officer must assess the applicant against the selection criteria for investors by examining the \napplicant's business and financial background. \nIf an officer is satisfied that the applicant meets the regulatory definition of investor, the applicant \nis assessed on a selection grid.  \nThe applicant will require 35 points out of a maximum of 100 available, as determined by \nthe Minister.  \nThe following grid outlines the criteria against which to assess the applicant and the points to be \nawarded. \nInvestors: Selection factors and maximum points \nBusiness experience*  \nMaximum  \n35 \nFive years business experience \n35 \nFour years business experience \n30 \nThree years business experience \n25 \nTwo years business experience \n20 \n* within five years preceding date of application.

Relevant documents include:  \nBusiness Immigration Application Form \n• \npersonal net worth statement  \n• \nbusiness balance sheet  \n• \nfinancial statements  \n• \ncorporate employee payroll (list) \nThese documents provide an accounting of the applicant's assets and liabilities and help the \nofficer to determine whether the applicant has the required business experience.  \n11.2. \nBusiness balance sheet and business income statement (financial statements) \nFor the purposes of assessing the applicant, the most important statements are the balance sheet \nand income statement.  \nOfficers should: \n• \nconsider the performance of the business over time. Financial statements for the previous five years \nshould be provided for comparative purposes. Previous business failures do not in themselves signify \nthe refusal of an application, but should be thoroughly explained by the applicant;  \n• \nreview the income statement to verify the completeness, measurement, occurrence and presentation \nof the component revenue and expenses.  \nNote: When reviewing the income statement, keep in mind that it is based on transactions. Particularly \nin the case of a small enterprise, it is advisable to look at the individual components and not simply \nthe net income. For example, business valuators normalize income by considering how much has \nbeen expended by the owner in salaries and how much would be a reasonable salary to pay an \nemployee to do the same job. An owner may not charge any salary at all and as a consequence may \nshow considerable net income or alternatively allocate a large amount to salary expenses and show \nvery little net income or even a loss for tax purposes. It would therefore be in order to inquire as to the \nnumber of employees and the amount of salary expenses which can be attributed to the owner.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \n \nIntegrity of financial statements  \nOfficers must carefully consider the integrity of the financial statements provided.   \nIn Canada, there are essentially three levels of assurance that a public accountant can provide to \nthe users of financial information:  \n• \naudits;  \n• \nreview engagements; and  \n• \ncompilation engagements.  \nThe majority of small companies or companies which do not have to report to a bank or other \ncreditors will just get a compilation when they get their tax returns professionally prepared.  \nMost countries have a similar range of reporting engagements. In particular, if there has been a \nBritish influence in the past (i.e., Hong Kong), the standards will be very close to ours.  \nWhen the veracity of the documentation is in doubt, the officer should: \n• \nfirst request further documentation. In the absence of suspicious circumstances, it will ordinarily be \nappropriate to accept financial statements which have been reported on by a reputable external \naccountant. Most small businesses are extremely unlikely to have been audited. \n \nReviewing other documentation  \nOfficers should review other supporting documentation as necessary. This documentation may \ninclude:  \n• \ncorporate income tax returns; \n• \npersonal income tax returns; \n• \nminute books; \n• \nshare certificates;  \n• \nmunicipal permits, business licenses, etc.; \n• \npayroll lists; \n• \nsales taxes; \n• \nproperty deeds, land registrations, appraisals, etc. \n \nCorporate income tax returns  \nOfficers may examine tax returns including information on: \n• \nowners and directors;  \n• \nrelated parties;  \n• \nprofit for income tax purposes;  \n• \nduration of operations.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \nNote: Net income (per the financial statements) and taxable income (per the tax return) will differ as a \nconsequence of the different treatment of certain items such as depreciation. However there should \nbe a reconciliation to explain the difference.  \nNote: It would certainly be cause for concern if it appears that different information is being presented \nfor the purposes of financial statements and tax reporting (two sets of books).  \nInability to produce tax records would be a cause for concern, as would a pattern of insufficient \nprofit to at least provide for the cost of living of the applicant and their dependants.  \nOfficers may encounter cases where they suspect some degree of tax evasion. In such cases, \nthe officer should be guided by the principle that it is the applicant's responsibility to discharge the \nonus of proof and that this is best done through the provision of objective documentation. \n \nPersonal income tax returns  \nOfficers may wish to review: \n• \nproprietor's profit and loss;  \n• \nsupporting financial statements.  \n \nMinute books  \nOfficers may also review: \n• \nshareholders' register;  \n• \nshareholders' resolutions ; \n• \nminutes of meetings ; \n• \narticles of incorporation. \n \nShare certificates  \nA review of share certificates may also provide indication of ownership. \n \nMunicipal permits, business licences, etc.  \nOfficers may wish to review municipal permits, business licences and other similar \ndocumentation, which should show the type of business organization.  \nMost business undertakings are conducted either as proprietorships, partnerships or corporations \n(legal entities organized for specific purposes with limited liability).  \nAs a general rule, most small businesses start as proprietorships or partnerships and evolve into \ncorporations as the level of business activity expands.  \nMost businesses must be registered or licensed. The business registration certificate shows in \nwhose name a business is registered. Though it may not indicate who owns or operates the \nbusiness, it may give the business address and indicate whether the business is a sole \nproprietorship, a partnership or a corporation. \n \nPayroll records  \nWith rare exceptions, payroll records are essential when determining eligibility for this class of \napplicants.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \n \nSales taxes and property deeds, land registrations, appraisals, etc.  \nOfficers may: \n• \nrequest a one-year record of bank deposits to verify their long-term ownership; \n• \nrequest property deeds or bank letters to verify ownership of property or stocks, amounts of \noutstanding mortgages and banking facilities used.  \nProperty appraisals are an extra expense to the applicant and should only be requested if the \nproperty value given by the applicant is questionable and this assessment is critical to total net \nworth. \n \nGeneral ledger, cash book or bank statements  \nOfficers may request supporting accounting records in some circumstances. \n12. \nProcedure: Making the admissibility decision \nIf the applicant meets the requirements of the selection criteria and the regulatory definition of \ninvestor, the officer will: \n• \nproceed to verify that the CDN $400,000  investment has been received by NHQ;  \n• \nensure that all other requirements (medical, security, etc.) are met; and \n• \nissue the permanent resident visa. \n12.1. \nSubstitution of evaluation \nR108 and R109 provide authority to issue or refuse a permanent resident visa in specific cases \nregardless of the points awarded. R109 applies if, in the officer's opinion, there are good reasons \nwhy the points awarded do not reflect the chances of the foreign national and their dependants \nbecoming economically established in Canada. Substitution of evaluation (positive or negative \ndiscretion) may be used for economic reasons (i.e., involving the ability to support oneself).  \nNote: The officer must obtain the concurrence of a second officer. In 1995, the Supreme Court \nconfirmed that this discretionary authority is restricted to successful establishment in the economic \nsense.  \n \nIssuing the permanent resident visa  \nNHQ will verify receipt of an investor’s $400,000 payment by e-mail to the applicable post. On \nvisa issuance, the post must inform NHQ by return e-mail. \nThis is important because the majority of investors use facilitators who provide financing and are \neligible for a $28,000 commission that is paid at time of visa issuance. It also informs the \nparticipating provinces that the investment is now irrevocable. \nIn cases where payment has not been made and all immigration requirements (medical, criminal, \nsecurity, etc.) have been met by applicants and their dependants, the visa office will notify the \nprincipal applicant, in writing, and request payment within 30 days of notification.\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \n13. \nProcedure: Investors destined to Quebec \nInvestors destined to Quebec are selected by Quebec Immigration officials and must obtain a \ncertificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ) as per R96(b) before a federal officer may consider their \napplication.  \nIf there are no indications of a possible refusal on statutory grounds (concerns about possible \ncriminality or concerns related to security, medical questions or relationship issues), the interview \nmay be waived.  \n14. \nProcedure: Refusals \nInvestor applicants who cannot meet the definition must be refused as per R90(2). Most refusals \nare based on the regulatory definition. For example, the applicant may not meet the business \nexperience threshold. Beyond that, the applicant may not meet the legally obtained minimum net \nworth standard (see provenance of funds Section 11 above). Finally, in rare cases, the applicant, \nwhile eligible, may not meet the selection criteria as per R102.  \nAn applicant described in any of the inadmissibility sections will be refused.  \nA person who applies as an investor is assessed in that class and accepted or refused. Officers \nare not required to assess a failed investor applicant as an entrepreneur or self-employed or in \nany other class.  \nWhere information is later presented that should have been disclosed at the interview and might \nhave at that time led to a positive decision, the officer should invite the applicant (in the absence \nof special circumstances) to submit a new application and pay a new cost recovery fee.  \nThe refusal letter must clearly state all the reasons for refusal in detail. (For sample refusal letters, \nsee appendixes.) \nAppendix \nA Refusal letter – Investors - Applications received pre-April 1, 1999 \nINSERT LETTERHEAD \nOur Ref.: \nINSERT ADDRESS \nDear: \nI have now completed the assessment of your application and I have determined that you do not \nqualify for immigration to Canada as an investor. \nSubsection 362 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act Regulations states that: \nIf, before April 1, 1999, a foreign national made an application for an immigrant visa as an \ninvestor and signed any document referred to in clause 1(v)(iii)(A) of Schedule X to the former \nRegulations, as that Schedule read immediately before that date, or, in the case of an investor in \na province, either applied for a selection certificate under section 3.1 of An Act respecting \nimmigration to Québec, R.S.Q., c.I-0.2, as amended from time to time, or applied for an immigrant \nvisa as an investor, and signed an investment agreement in accordance with the law of that \nprovince, the relevant provisions of the former Regulations respecting an applicant for an \nimmigrant visa as investor, an approved business, an investor in a province, a fund manager, an \neligible business, an approved fund, a fund, an escrow agent, a privately administered venture \ncapital fund or a government-administered venture capital fund continue to apply as they read \nimmediately before April 1, 1999 to all persons governed by their application before that date. \nSubsection 2(1) of the Immigration Regulations, 1978, defines an investor as an immigrant who: \n(a) has successfully operated, controlled or directed a business, (b) has made a minimum\nOP 9 Investors \n2008-08-08 \ninvestment in the sum of $(enter the appropriate investment amount based on the province) \nas described in subsection 2(1) of the Immigration Regulations since the date of the investor's \napplication for an immigrant visa as an investor and c) has a net worth, accumulated by the \nimmigrant's own endeavours, of at least $500,000.  \nYou do not meet the definition of investor because (insert reasons why applicant does not \nmeet any or all of the above criteria (a), (b) or (c))  \nSubsection 9(4) of the Immigration Act provides that where a visa officer is satisfied that it would \nnot be contrary to the Act or Regulations to grant landing or entry to an applicant, that officer may \nissue a visa if, in his or her opinion, that applicant meets the requirements of the Act and the \nRegulations.
